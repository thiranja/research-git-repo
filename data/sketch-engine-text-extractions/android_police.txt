<p> Welcome to the roundup of the new Android games that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous week or so. Today's list is broken up into several segments, ranging from best, average, to mediocre game releases from the last week. So whether you're looking for the best games of quality or are simply looking for the latest gacha releases, you're covered. This week we saw the arrival of a gorgeous textless adventure game, the launch of the sequel to 911 Operator, and the debut of an enjoyable brick breaker that sports an artistic theme. So without further ado, here are the new and notable Android games released during the week of October 19th, 2020. </p>
<p> Please wait for this page to load in full in order to see the widgets, which include ratings and pricing info. </p>

<p> Best Games </p>
<p> Titles that offer fair pricing, enjoyable gameplay, polished interfaces, or are intriguing </p>
<p> FAR: Lone Sails </p>
<p> FAR: Lone Sails is a drop-dead gorgeous game that was ported to Android and released this week, and even though it's a story-driven title, there isn't a lick of text within this release. Everything is told through the game's animations, which is indeed the highlight of this game. Sadly the touch controls take some getting used to, and since physical controller support is absent, players will have to get used to them, though the game is definitely worth experiencing despite the iffy controls. It's also worth pointing out that FAR: Lone Sails only lasts 3 hours or so, so it's a short experience, but still, it's an experience worth the asking price, which is why this title is listed under the best games section in today's roundup. It is indeed a sight to behold. </p>
<p> 112 Operator </p>
<p> 112 Operator is the sequel to Jutsu Games' emergency dispatcher simulation game 911 Operator. Even though the Android arrival comes late compared to other platforms, now that the game is here, I can confidently say it's an enjoyable sim. Since this is a sequel, it offers much more depth than the original and is 25% larger thanks to its real-world expandable maps. All in all, this is a competent release that offers fair monetization, which is why this is easily one of the better games released this week, especially if you're looking for depth and longevity. Oh, and if you'd like to try before you buy, there's a free demo available too. </p>
<p> BreakBoard </p>
<p> At first blush, BreakBoard might not look enticing, but if you check out the trailer below, you'll see that this brick breaker actually offers a slick theme. All of the blocks are displayed with a fitting colored pencil style, and unlike most brick breakers, there's no paddle at the bottom of the screen. Instead, you'll draw lines that act as the paddle when the ball nears. This makes for a very active and hectic game as you frantically draw lines to keep these balls going, all so you can clear the latest board. So if you're a fan of brick breaking games, I definitely recommend BreakBoard. </p>
<p> Monetization: free / no ads / IAPs from $1.00 - $4.00 </p>
<p> Chook & Sosig: Walk the Plank </p>
<p> Chook & Sosig: Walk the Plank is a positively-reviewed point-and-click adventure game that was released on Steam in 2019 and has this week made its way to Android. While I wouldn't call this a popular indie game, it's an enjoyable title that offers a charming atmosphere and an intriguing story that sports many different endings. This means the game offers a fair bit of replayability, so even though it's a short experience at 3 hours, you can easily replay several times if you'd like to see each ending. </p>
<p> Monetization: free / contains ads / IAPs $4.99 apiece </p>
<p> Power Volt </p>
<p> Power Volt is a charming platformer that takes advantage of slingshot controls, which works well with touchscreen play. What's unique about this release is that each of the game's worlds offers its own unique mechanics, so as you progress, the gameplay changes. This means there are multiple areas to explore, and there are even a few boss fights in the mix, so you don't have to worry about things ever growing stale since this game will defnitely keep you on your toes. </p>
<p> Monetization: free / contains ads / IAPs $2.49 apiece </p>
<p> The Owl and Lighthouse - story collecting </p>
<p> It's rare that I cover idle games since they are numerous and pretty basic, as far as mobile games go, but that doesn't mean there still aren't a few noteworthy idle games out there, and The Owl and Lighthouse is one such title. What's interesting about this release is that you'll be rewarded with new stories to read each time you deliver a carving from the wood you collect, which actually adds purpose to your wood-based grinding. So if you'd like to unlock interesting stories as you grind away in the latest idle game on the Play Store, The Owl and Lighthouse delivers a polished and worthwhile experience that offers exactly that. While the in-app purchases aren't the best, they can be ignored for the most part. </p>
<p> Monetization: free / no ads / IAPs from $0.99 - $9.99 </p>
<p> Do Not Touch </p>
<p> Do Not Touch comes from Nickelodeon and is a free release that offers an engaging augmented reality experience. This app can display a Do Not Touch button, and should you press it, weird and strange things can happen. There are even a few mini-games in the mix to keep kids busy, though proper lighting is definitely recommended since AR can be finicky. At the very least, this is a free release, and while AR can be iffy, what's on offer is enjoyable with the correct lighting. </p>
<p> Average Games </p>
<p> Titles that may not be the best-of-the-best, but still offer fun and interesting mechanics </p>
<p> Spooky Squashers </p>
<p> Spooky Squashers is a simple arcade game supported by advertisements, and while the game's graphics are somewhat simple, the gameplay is enjoyable. You'll play the part of a pumpkin that's hitting a squash ball in a square stage. This ball, of course, bounces off of the walls, and it will be your job to take out the game's enemies by hitting them with this ball. It's a simple setup that's fun in short bursts, plus the Halloween theme ensures the game is fitting for a late October release. </p>
<p> Mergetin </p>
<p> Mergetin may look simple, thanks to its plain graphics, but this is actually a fun game that combines the mechanics of a falling block title with 2048. It will be your job to keep the playfield as clear as possible, but in order to do this, you'll have to place blocks and then combine them in order to clear up more room for more blocks. Much like 2048, the goal is to merge the numbers on these blocks into the highest options possible, which is going to take a lot of skill and patience since you only have so much room to work with. While it's a bummer that the game's advertisements can't be removed, here's hoping the dev eventually adds a way to pay to remove them. </p>
<p> Hidden Cats: Detective Agency </p>
<p> Hidden Cats: Detective Agency comes from HyperBeard, a studio that already offers several cat-themed titles, including the series Kleptocats. As you can tell, Hidden Cats: Detective Agency offers s similar theme, though this time around, you'll spend your sessions investigating lost cats. That's right, this is indeed a detective game, and the goal is to earn money by looking for lost cats in order to upgrade your office so that you can attract more customers. While the monetization isn't the best, it doesn't interfere with the gameplay that much, so if you enjoy cat-based games, this is an alright release. </p>
<p> Monetization: free / contains ads / IAPs from $1.99 - $29.99 </p>
<p> Sweet Sins Superstars </p>
<p> Sweet Sins Superstars is a title that left early access this week, and it's a release that clearly offers adorable kawaii art. This is a rhythm game, and so perfect timing is the key to success. Mostly you'll spend your time tapping on the screen to the beat of the game's music, and these songs will grow more and more difficult the further you progress. Luckily there's a choice of easy, medium, and hard levels, so no matter your gaming skills, there's content here for you to enjoy. So while the title's monetization isn't the best, for the most part, it can be ignored unless you'd like to unlock more content. </p>
<p> Monetization: free / contains ads / IAPs from $2.99 - $54.99 </p>
<p> Shortcut Run </p>
<p> Shortcut Run comes from VOODOO, a publisher that loves to stuff its game with advertisements. Luckily these ads can be removed with a single in-app purchase, and while Shortcut Run doesn't offer the best graphics, the multiplayer racing gameplay can be fun in short bursts. Each course contains piles of sticks, and these sticks can be used to build shortcuts between platforms as you race, so there is a bit of strategy to this release, which is why the game is enjoyable. So if you enjoy casual games of skill, Shortcut Run is worth a look. Just keep in mind that performance isn't the best. </p>
<p> Monetization: free / contains ads / IAPs $3.99 apiece </p>
<p> Mediocre Games </p>
<p> Titles that are buggy, unpolished, or offer aggressive monetization </p>
<p> NEO:BALL </p>
<p> NEO:BALL finally left early access this week, and the game plays like a neon-infused top-down version of Rocket League, albeit moderately simplified. The game only offers one-on-one matches, and really, the entire thing plays like a match of air hockey, which I enjoy. The game's pills function as strikers, and so it will be your job to get the ball in the goal while blocking any attempts from your opponent. It's a classic setup that looks great in action, though the game is monetized rather aggressively, and since the title often uses bots instead of matching real people, it's hard to recommend this release. </p>
<p> Monetization: free / contains ads / IAPs from $0.99 - $104.99 </p>
<p> Chaos Combat Chess </p>
<p> Chaos Combat Chess is the latest generic auto-chess game to land on Android, and like all of the rest, this is a highly monetized affair. Ideally, this release offers a fast way to jump into online matches, shooting for the casual crowd. Still, seeing that there are over 50 characters to play with that each offers ten different skill sets, it's clear this auto-chess clone is still pretty complicated while not really bringing anything new to the table outside of the fact it plays in portrait instead of landscape. </p>
<p> Monetization: free / contains ads / IAPs from $0.99 - $99.99 </p>
<p> Summoners Glory: Eternal Fire </p>
<p> Summoners Glory: Eternal Fire is the latest no-name RPG to land on the Play Store, and as you can guess, this is a greedily-monetized release that sports an awful English translation, almost as if this title exists squarely as a cynical cash-grab designed from the ground up to annoy players into spending money to alleviate its many grind walls. Basically, the game is pay-to-win, and while the graphics are great, the casual MMO gameplay that often gates progression leaves a heck of a lot to be desired. </p>
<p> Monetization: free / no ads / IAPs from $0.99 - $99.99 </p>
<p> ILLUSION CONNECT </p>
<p> Illusion Connect is a real-time strategy game where you'll pit teams of waifus against the CPU as well as online opponents. As you can guess, this is a gacha game, so the title's real-time battles take a backseat to collecting waifus, and like all games of this nature, the title is monetized heavily. There's also a stamina system, so you can only play for free for about an hour at a time, which really holds this release back as far as gacha games are concerned. While the drop rates seem okay so far, there's no telling how the game will be mismanaged in the future since that tends to be the fate of generic releases like this. </p>
<p> Monetization: free / no ads / IAPs from $0.99 - $99.99 </p>
<p> Badlanders </p>
<p> Badlanders is the latest generic battle royale from NetEase, and it just entered into a public beta this week. Of course, since this is a beta, the game is still in a rough spot, and so lag is frequent, which really ruins any fun that could be had. Of course, the game is also heavily monetized, and even though it doesn't run that well, NetEase is already offering in-app purchases. It would seem greed is more important than fun with this studio, which isn't a surprise, but it's disappointing all the same. </p>
<p> Monetization: free / no ads / IAPs from $0.99 - $99.99 </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/10/26/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-is-coming-to-android-and-ios-all-thanks-to-netease/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549416" filename="bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-is-coming-to-android-and-ios-all-thanks-to-netease">
<p> In cooperation with ArtPlay Games, NetEase just announced that it will bring the popular Metroidvania title Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night to Android and iOS, and the game will be released worldwide as a premium title, just like on consoles and PC. Bloodstained was created by Koji Igarashi, the producer behind some of the more popular Castlevania titles such as Harmony of Dissonance. This is why the 2019 release for Bloodstained was hotly anticipated, which is why I'm sure more than a few people will be excited to see how the game stacks up on mobile. </p>
<p> Above, you can watch the original story trailer for Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, and while this isn't an Android-specific video, it provides a solid look at what the game will offer on mobile. As you can see, this is a Metroidvania title, which means it's an exploration-focused platformer that should feel familiar to Castlevania and Metroid fans alike. </p>
<p> Since NetEase just announced this mobile port, details are still light. We don't know when the game will launch on Android or how much it will cost. What we do know is that NetEase is targeting a worldwide release on Android and iOS and that the game will be available at a single price-point. We also know that a redesigned UI is in the works, along with a new achievement system. </p>
<p> Frankly, I'm a little surprised that NetEase announced that it's going to bring Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night to mobile, especially since the Nintendo Switch port still suffers from performance issues, even after a slew of updates, and that's a device with active cooling. How the game will perform on mobile, a platform where the majority of devices are passively cooled, is anyone's guess. Let's just say I'm a little trepidatious to see how NetEase handles the port. Of course, it's still exciting to hear that a quality Metroidvania title is coming to the platform soon. Let's just hope things turn out better than they did on the Switch. </p>
<p> Press Release </p>
<p> Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night announced for iOS and Android </p>
<p> Guangzhou, China, 26. October 2020 – Today, NetEase Games and ArtPlay are delighted to announce that they are co-developing the mobile version of the critically acclaimed action roleplaying adventure (ARPG), Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. The game will launch globally by NetEase Games as a premium title on iOS and Android. </p>
<p> Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is a polished side-scrolling metroidvania experience with ARPG-elements, produced by Koji Igarashi. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night’s core gameplay allows players to improve their character in a multitude of unique ways by utilizing different shards in-game. Combining a strong ARPG heritage with proven fan-favorite gameplay and a gorgeous art style, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is set to stand out from the crowd when it launches onto mobile platforms. </p>
<p> Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night for iOS and Android features all the action, gameplay and content of its console forebear with no compromises on visual quality or gameplay fidelity. </p>
<p> Additionally, NetEase Games and ArtPlay have taken the opportunity to implement new features and improvements unique to the mobile version. The UI and the 108 different shard icons have been fully redesigned to give players the best possible experience. Weapons and combos have also been adapted to let players customize their fighting style to suit their play style, even without a controller. Finally, the mobile version includes all console DLC which makes this release the definitive edition of the game - for playing on the go. </p>
<p> Featuring over 120 unique mobs and bosses to vanquish and a giant Gothic castle to explore bursting with challenges and surprises, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night for iOS and Android is sure to be a must-buy for any mobile RPG fan. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/10/26/facebook-also-wants-to-give-cloud-gaming-a-try/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549876" filename="facebook-also-wants-to-give-cloud-gaming-a-try">
<p> Facebook has been invested in games for a long time (Farmville, anyone?), and even though the company's latest Oculus headset garnered heavy criticism for its Facebook login requirement, it's still pushing forward with new initiatives. Cloud gaming is apparently the next frontier for the company contributing to election interference, though Facebook is taking a different approach than its rivals. </p>
<p> "It’s critical for us to start with latency-tolerant games so we can deliver a good experience for players across a variety of devices," Facebook wrote in a blog post. "For the purposes of our beta, that includes genres like sports, card, simulation, and strategy games. [...] As our beta progresses and cloud technology scales, we'll increase the variety of game genres." </p>
<p> As opposed to platforms like Xbox Game Streaming and Google Stadia, which aim to deliver PC/console-level titles to new form factors, Facebook is starting with ports of mobile games. The first titles available are Asphalt 9: Legends, Mobile Legends: Adventure, PGA TOUR Golf Shootout, Solitaire: Arthur’s Tale, and WWE SuperCard — exciting stuff. Facebook said it is sticking to free-to-play games for now, and there's no cost to use the streaming service, though the company didn't rule out an eventual paid option with more types of games. </p>
<p> Facebook's cloud gaming is rolling out in California, Texas and Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states including, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Virginia, and West Virginia. The service will arrive in more regions "in the coming months," and you can give it a try on the web at fb.gg/play. The Facebook app on Android will also support cloud gaming, though not the iOS app (for the same reasons that blocked Stadia and Xbox). </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/10/26/five-great-cases-for-your-new-pixel-5/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549327" filename="five-great-cases-for-your-new-pixel-5">
<p> This story was originally published 2020/10/22 6:00am PDTon Oct 22, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/26 9:54am PDTon Oct 26, 2020. </p>
<p> Your Pixel 5 just arrived, clean, pristine, and unapologetically slippery with that speckled bio resin coating. It’s worth protecting, isn’t it? If you’re thinking about wrapping your new Google phone in a fancy case, we’ve rounded up five of the most compelling options on the market. </p>
<p> Most personalized protection: dbrand Grip (Featured) </p>
<p> If you want to wrap your phone in a legitimately protective case, but you don't want to be trapped in a sea of black, blue, and transparent blandness, dbrand's Grip is going to be your best option. </p>
<p> Available in combination with dozens of dbrand's skins, the Grip is the best way to keep your phone's look personal, without going full-on "I very obviously rattle-canned this in my backyard" personal. </p>
<p> You can choose from textures like dbrand's signature Dragon and Swarm, or keep it low key with dbrand's Seafoam Green from the Pastels lineup, as we've done here. You can also rest assured that skin will fit on there perfectly, with dbrand's absurdly tight tolerances covering every square millimeter with precision. </p>
<p> The Grip itself is a tough customer, with full 360-degree lip protection for your precious Pixel, and strong, reinforced corners to withstand your highly rugged lifestyle (read: dropping your phone at the grocery store). </p>
<p> Most fun: Official Pixel fabric case </p>
<p> Google's official fabric cases have always tickled us. They're so different, so unique, and generally just so nice to touch that we can't resist their woven charm. Available in some decidedly more bold finishes this year, like the Green Chameleon you see here, they're just so full of character. </p>
<p> The fabric case gives your power button some real pop, and the cutout along the chin ensures your various swiping and swooping won't be interfered with during day to day navigation. If you want the most Pixely Pixel case, it's hard to argue with these. Also, that texture is just something else — maybe not for everyone, but we've always been big fans. </p>
<p> Most eco-friendly: Pela Case </p>
<p> So, you're concerned about wasting plastic. We get it. Most phone cases do, sadly, end up in a landfill one day, and used phone cases generally aren't something most people end up trading around a lot. Enter the Pela Case. </p>
<p> The Pela Case is made of 100% compostable materials, so when it finally is time to discard it, you can know it won't be adding to some nation-sized plastic cyclone in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. </p>
<p> There are basic colors, but you can also upgrade to some of the special edition prints Pela offers, like this Honey Bee Edition we're rocking right here. If the environment is issue one for you, Pela is definitely the top option if you actually do want a case for your phone in the first place. </p>
<p> Most protective, least visible: Otterbox Symmetry </p>
<p> Otterbox has long been synonymous with big, beefy protection for all your various electronics, but the Symmetry case is more of their "best of both worlds" model. It offers very serious protection — the Symmetry is thicc —but keeps your Pixel's look and feel front and center. </p>
<p> The clear polycarbonate case means you see your phone, not a case, and that you're still protected in the event of a significant "oops." The Symmetry features a reduced lip along the bottom of the phone, too, for easier use of Android's gestures. </p>
<p> Most protection on a budget: Spigen Tough Armor </p>
<p> Spigen is a byword in cases, and there's a reason for that: you get a lot of case for not a lot of money. The Tough Armor has long been one of our favorites for this reason — that, and it has an awesome kickstand. </p>
<p> The Tough Armor uses two layers of protection to ensure your Pixel can survive a nasty encounter with smartphone enemy number one: the ground. Did we mention it has a kickstand? It has a kickstand. Kickstands are good. </p>
<p> Spigen cases also retain good button feel, and offer an understated look for those of us who aren't interested in a flashy smartphone aesthetic. </p>
<p> Which should you buy? </p>
<p> The official Pixel fabric cases catch our eye every year, and this one is no different: they're real lookers, and you probably will get a comment or two if you use one. dbrand's Grip is also a great option if you want to add a more personal sense of personality to your Pixel. And Spigen's Tough Armor is a good buy if the bottom line is the bottom line for you. </p>

Additionally, any companies with "featured" products paid to have their listing featured more prominently, but have no editorial input into any of the content featured in their listing or this page. Android Police also has an ongoing advertising relationship with Spigen unrelated to this post. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/09/14 3:24pm PDTon Sep 14, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/25 2:05pm PDTon Oct 25, 2020. </p>
<p> Are you tired of looking at your old boring wallpaper? Google recently published 3 new collections of wallpapers to the Chrome OS Canary channel, and in my opinion: they're stunning. You can download them right now — even if you don't own a Chromebook. </p>
<p> I get it. Having a plain, solid color background is important to keep you less distracted from your work in an enterprise setting. But with your device, personalization is key to make your computer look fresh and exciting. </p>
<p> Collage </p>
<p> Want something relaxing? This wallpaper collection features an analogous color palette that is gorgeous and easy to look at. Matthew Hollister did an amazing job keeping the mood serene and harmonious by creating a nice balance of color and contrast. </p>
<p> Made by Canvas </p>
<p> Feeling contemporary? These artworks were drawn on Chrome Canvas, a popular drawing app by Google. I love how animated and alive these illustrations are, especially the mid-century feel and color pop to emphasize the contemporary look. Russ Gray and Hedof both did a terrific job with this collection. </p>
<p> Element </p>
<p> Love 3-D abstract art as much as I do? Abstract designs like this collection create a unique composition using shapes, form, and gestural marks. I love how Rutger Paulusse takes advantage of translucency, lighting, and gradients to create a unique design metaphor. Some of these backgrounds have a dark variant, hinting that Chrome OS Dark mode may be right around the corner. </p>
<p> A lot of requests have been pouring in, wishing Google's new Chrome OS wallpaper collection could be optimized for mobile. Well, with a fair amount of effort, I compiled and extracted all of the wallpapers for you to enjoy on your phone. Here's a quick preview. </p>
<p> Mobile variants of the Chrome OS wallpapers released late this year </p>
<p> New downloads for the mobile versions of the wallpaper collection are available at the "Mobile" link down below. </p>
<p> End of Update </p>
<p> Download </p>
<p> Chrome OS Canary users can get Collage, Made by Canvas, and Element now in the wallpaper picker, but you have to enable chrome://flags/#use-wallpaper-staging-url for them to show up. If you're not on Chrome OS Canary or don't own a Chromebook, no worries: I got you covered. </p>
<p> You can download these wallpapers uncompressed in 3000 x 2000 resolution by clicking the source link at the bottom of the page. Adding new wallpapers may not seem significant on the surface, but it shows that Google cares about making a quality experience to users. </p>

<p> When Google announced G Suite successor Workspace, it also took the opportunity to update the icons of its productivity apps, both for consumers and businesses. The new designs are slowly rolling out and have already reached Gmail, Drive, Meet, and Chat on many people's phones and computers. The latest design updates to hit Android phones are the Docs and Sheets icons, and boy, they're a regression. </p>
<p> As 9to5Google first spotted, the new icons are barely different from what we got before on the web and the Android app splash screen — the drop shadow coming from the icons' earmarks is gone and the spacing and thickness of each app's pictograms has changed ever so slightly. </p>
<p> But the Android app launcher icons have seen a more considerate update. Instead of stretching each icon's background across the full adaptive icon mask as it used to be done, the redesigned icons are displayed in their full page-shaped glory, complete with a white background around it. That makes the new design stand right in line with other recent redesigns (remember the old Google Maps logo?), but it's a bummer nonetheless — two more icons on our homescreens are now no longer colorful, making our launchers look a little duller and apps harder to tell apart. </p>
<p> The new icons are part of version 1.20.422.01 for both applications. If you're eager to see them on your phone, you can download the updates from APK Mirror (Docs, Sheets) or wait until they roll out to you via the Play Store. It's probably only a matter of time until Slides joins in. </p>

<p> When Google revamped G Suite with a new name earlier this month, it gave makeovers to a number of existing logos as well. Not everyone is a fan of the new look, but like it or not, the new icons have started to show up on a phone near you. It started with the Drive icon, then a wild Gmail icon appeared last week. Now Google Calendar is joining the fray, and you can get the update containing the new logo right now. </p>
<p> Epson, the world's number one projector manufacturer, introduced its first projector running Android TV earlier this year. Now the company is back with two more powerful projectors that introduce Android TV to its EpiqVision line, along with additional perks like an audio system custom designed by Yamaha. </p>
<p> LG introduced new Tone Free earbuds earlier this year, and saying we didn't like them would be an understatement. Now the company is back with another set of earbuds in the Tone Free lineup that add a key feature — but is it enough to stand out against the crowded competition? </p>
<p> Paying via NFC with Google Pay is more convenient, safe, and hygienic than swiping a payment card through a seldomly cleaned payment terminal. These days, almost every flagship phone includes the NFC interface required for Google Pay to function. But that doesn't guarantee that tap-to-pay will actually work. Recently, issues have popped up on the Galaxy Note20 Ultra and the Pixel 5 — but it looks like this problem might be much more far reaching. </p>
<p> Last year, Google made a shaky promise to include recycled materials in all its products by 2022. According to the company, it's hit that goal early — all new Pixel and Nest products now include recycled materials in their design. In light of this success, Google has announced some new sustainability goals for the next few years. </p>
<p> Camera quality has always been a major differentiating factor when choosing between smartphones, but it seems like the competition has gotten more intense over the last few years. Some manufactures like OnePlus and Huawei use sensors with big megapixel counts to stand out from the crowd, while others like Apple and Google rely more on the marriage between hardware and software. With such a tight race for the winner of the camera crown, we're highlighting three recent YouTube comparisons worth a watch. </p>
<p> YouTube is one of the most widely used apps in the world, so whenever the company makes even a slight change, people notice. The announcement that four playlist-centric features were being killed last month was a bit disheartening, but YouTube's latest move doesn't kill off old features — instead it brings a variety of useful new ones to life, including streamlined player controls and a more accessible captions button. </p>
<p> Traveling isn't at the forefront of most people's minds right now, but when it is necessary, the Mobile Passport app makes it a whole lot easier for passport holders. The digital passport service was already available in 27 airports across the US, and the latest version of the app includes support for another two: Honolulu and Oakland. </p>

<p> Your Pixel 5 just arrived, clean, pristine, and unapologetically slippery with that speckled bio resin coating. It’s worth protecting, isn’t it? If you’re thinking about wrapping your new Google phone in a fancy case, we’ve rounded up five of the most compelling options on the market. </p>
<p> Welcome to Monday, everyone. It would seem that we have a huge roundup to start the week, with many games and icon packs that are currently on sale. Of course, this means I have more than a few standouts to share with everyone. First up is Star Wars: KOTOR, a fantastic RPG that plays great on mobile. Next is Slayaway Camp, one of my favorite puzzle games that's perfect for Halloween. We also have Rebuild, an enjoyable strategy game all about surviving the zombie apocalypse, another title that's perfect for All Hallows' Eve. As always, I've highlighted all of the interesting titles in bold to make discovery easier. </p>

<p> LG introduced new Tone Free earbuds earlier this year, and saying we didn't like them would be an understatement. Now the company is back with another set of earbuds in the Tone Free lineup that add a key feature — but is it enough to stand out against the crowded competition? </p>
<p> The HBS-FN7 (catchy, right?) are basically an updated version of LG's HBS-FN6 earbuds, meaning they offer comfy in-ear fit, sound tuned by Meridian, and even a fancy charging case that uses ultraviolet light to eliminate 99.9% of certain bacteria from the earbuds' inner mesh. (No, it probably isn't effective against COVID-19.) The case also features an LED light on top that reveals the charging level and cleanliness status, which is handy. </p>
<p> What's totally new about these is the active noise cancellation, a first for LG's Tone Free range. The company has outfitted the FN7 with three microphones on each earbud that monitor incoming sound waves and neutralize them. The patented twist-fit "Vortex Ribs" on the adjustable ear gels, along with the new ANC functionality, should help these buds block out a good amount of environmental noise. </p>
<p> They launch today in South Korea, and should also be available in parts of of North America, Europe and Asia starting later this year — although if they sound as uninspiring as the Tone Free buds we reviewed earlier this year, we'd probably recommend skipping this track. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/10/26/oneplus-is-having-trouble-unlocking-t-mobile-8t-phones/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17550971" filename="oneplus-is-having-trouble-unlocking-t-mobile-8t-phones">
<p> The OnePlus 8T is available to purchase from T-Mobile and OnePlus' own online store, though the phone differs slightly depending on where you bought it from. The T-Mobile includes an IP68 rating and various software tweaks, and just like most phones you buy through carriers, it requires a special code to unlock the bootloader. However, the process for bootloader-unlocking the T-Mobile variant seems to be broken at the moment. </p>
<p> OnePlus has an unlock token form on its website, where owners of carrier-branded models can enter their phone's serial number, unlock code (provided by the carrier), and IMEI. However, there are multiple reports that the website rejects all unlock codes with the message "Please enter a valid unlock code." </p>
<p> This is similar to what happened with the T-Mobile OnePlus 8 earlier this year, which also couldn't be unlocked for a short period of time due to errors with the same tool. It's possible OnePlus hasn't fully updated its website for the 8T yet, or there could be communication issues between the company's servers and T-Mobile. </p>
<p> This post previously stated the unlock code was for SIM-unlocking, but the unlock token form is only for unlocking the phone's bootloader. OnePlus has also confirmed that the page will be updated shortly to work with T-Mobile's variant of the OnePlus 8T. We apologize for the confusion. </p>

<p> Camera quality has always been a major differentiating factor when choosing between smartphones, but it seems like the competition has gotten more intense over the last few years. Some manufactures like OnePlus and Huawei use sensors with big megapixel counts to stand out from the crowd, while others like Apple and Google rely more on the marriage between hardware and software. With such a tight race for the winner of the camera crown, we're highlighting three recent YouTube comparisons worth a watch. </p>
<p> In the first video, YouTuber Danny Winget tests out the low-light capabilities of the Pixel 5, iPhone 12 Pro, and Galaxy Note20 Ultra. These phones represent the best that Apple, Google, and Samsung are giving us this year, and this is a great look at how each of these flagships handle nighttime video and photography. Google's Night Sight, so impressive two years ago, isn't that unique anymore, and Apple reigns supreme when it comes to shooting crispy video even in dim situations. </p>
<p> In this comparison from Ben's Gadget Reviews, the latest phones from Apple and Google go up against the Mate 40 Pro, Huawei's latest warrior in the camera wars. The Chinese manufacturer's smartphone cameras are known for producing some of the best results around, and the Mate 40 Pro comes equipped with a huge 50MP main sensor that lets an incredible amount of light in. Accompanied by a 20MP ultra-wide and a 12MP periscope lens, it can take shots impossible with Apple's and Google's hardware — now if only it had Google apps. </p>
<p> The final video, also from Danny Winget, pits the Pixel 5 against Samsung's S20 FE and the newest flagship from OnePlus, the 8T. While all of the phones produce great pics, this comparison gives a great look at how each company treats images differently. While Google goes for a more natural look, Samsung leans the opposite way and cranks the saturation sky-high. OnePlus, meanwhile, tends to strike a balance between the two directions. </p>
<p> Google took the still photography game by storm with the "best smartphone camera ever" in the OG Pixel released back in 2016, but the company is still using leaning on a nearly-identical 12MP sensor. Google can do a lot of heavy lifting on the software side, but it's clear that still photography, previously the Pixel's knockout punch, isn't hitting the way it used to — the competition has caught up. </p>
<p> In terms of video, Apple has enjoyed the advantage for years, and while it doesn't look like that's going to change anytime soon, competitors like OnePlus, Samsung, and even Google are improving. Taking photos at night is always going to be a struggle due to physics, but Samsung's night mode on the Note20 Ultra is impressive, making it one of the better choices for low light photography. </p>
<p> I think the moral of the story is that no matter which phone you keep in your pocket, you can't really do wrong with any modern flagship — but when it comes to capturing under certain conditions, some phones do a lot more right. If you're craving additional camera comparisons, check out some of our own shootouts here. </p>

<p> Paying via NFC with Google Pay is more convenient, safe, and hygienic than swiping a payment card through a seldomly cleaned payment terminal. These days, almost every flagship phone includes the NFC interface required for Google Pay to function. But that doesn't guarantee that tap-to-pay will actually work. Recently, issues have popped up on the Galaxy Note20 Ultra and the Pixel 5 — but it looks like this problem might be much more far reaching. </p>
<p> While owners of newer phones like the Pixel 5 and Galaxy Note20 Ultra have complained about NFC issues affecting the use of Google Pay in stores, they aren't the only devices experiencing this problem. Some users of the OnePlus 8 from earlier this year seem to be running into the same error. Google Pay allows them to sign in and register cards just fine, but trying to use tap-to-pay just brings up the red exclamation mark and a very helpful message stating "That didn't work." </p>
<p> Since writing about the Galaxy Note20 Ultra's issues last week, we've learned that this issue seems to affect multiple generations of Pixel devices as well, including last year's Pixel 4 series. While it's possible that all of these NFC issues are unrelated, it does seem like these problems with Google Pay could run deeper than mere device-specific issues. </p>
<p> There doesn't seem to be a surefire way to resolve the problem currently. The usual cure-alls like resetting the device or re-installing the Google Pay app don't seem to make any difference for most people affected. Since the app relies on Google, OEMs, and banking institutions, there are a lot of possible culprits to blame for this bug. </p>
<p> Hopefully it's something that can be resolved with a future update to the Google Pay app, which you can find on APK Mirror and the Play Store. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/10/08 9:01am PDTon Oct 8, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/26 5:32am PDTon Oct 26, 2020. </p>
<p> Samsung kicked off this month's security patch rollout last week with the budget Galaxy A50. Within days of that release, some of its recent S Pen-clad flagships are also being bumped to the latest Android security level. Alongside their international variants, the US Note20 and Note10 series have started getting the October update, starting with the unlocked models. </p>
<p> An OTA update is already reaching the Galaxy Note20 Ultra, Note20, Note10+, and the Note10 in the US. Only their unlocked models are currently receiving the build, but given Samsung's performance in the last couple of months, you can expect the carrier variants and other Galaxy phones to follow suit pretty soon. With the limited information available right now, we can't really say what else these updates are bringing to the table, apart from the new patches. </p>
<p> The following are all Samsung phones in the US that have been patched up to the October 2020 level, with the latest additions to the list highlighted in bold. </p>
<p> Galaxy Note10+: QP1A.190711.020.N975USQS4DTI1, rolling out since October 19 </p>
<p> Galaxy Note10: QP1A.190711.020.N970USQS4DTI1, rolling out since October 19 </p>
<p> Galaxy A71 </p>
<p> Verizon: Galaxy A71 5G UW: QP1A.190711.020.A716VSQU1BTJ2, rolling out since October 15 </p>
<p> Galaxy A50 </p>
<p> Verizon: Galaxy A50: QP1A.190711.020.A505USQS9BTI4, rolling out since October 19 </p>
<p> To check if the update is ready to download on your unit, you can head to Settings > Software Update. If you still don't see an update notification, you'll have to wait for these staged rollouts to reach you. </p>
<p> Updated to include the Verizon Galaxy A50 and A71 5G UW, along with T-Mobile's Galaxy S10 and AT&T's Note10 series. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/usb-c-cable/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17558148" filename="usb-c-cable">
<p> There are a ton of smart devices in your life. The first one that comes to mind may be your smartphone or your computer, but what about all the other gadgets you use every week, like your wireless headphones, Bluetooth speakers, and rechargeable mice, just to name a few? Despite the tech industry's slow shift toward adopting a USB-C charging standard, the truth is that many of your devices have a variety of hardwired connections: Micro USB, USB-C, and even Apple's proprietary Lightning port. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a single charging cord that could replace that wad of wires unceremoniously shoved in your bedside nightstand? </p>
<p> Prime Day 2018 has come and gone, but there are still plenty of solid deals to be had at Amazon. If you're looking to stock up on some discounted fast wireless chargers, USB-C cables, wall chargers, and car chargers, Choetech has some promo codes offering up to 54% off on those items. </p>
<p> It seems like every manufacturer is gearing up for Prime Day, and Choetech is no exception. Right now over at Amazon, you can pick up a variety of USB-C cables (one reviewed by Benson), a 5 port 90W QC 3.0 charger, and even a pair of waterproof phone bags. These deals are set to expire on the 10th (Amazon Prime Day), so you only have a few days left. </p>
<p> Do you still have drawers around your place filled with dated microUSB cables? It's 2017, and USB-C has been proliferating down the phone spectrum. It won't be long now until even low-end devices are sporting the world's newest and best USB connector. You had better get prepared, and the first step is replacing all those old cables. Here's a 40% off deal ($11.99) via coupon code for a 6-pack of assorted length Choetech USB-C to USB-C cables at Amazon. Welcome to the future. </p>
<p> It's not often a deal ends up being over 50% off, but that's the case today. Right now over at Amazon, you can pick up a pair of six-foot USB-C to USB-C cables for $5 with a coupon code. They aren't explicitly Benson approved, but they are alleged to possess the requisite resistor, and the current ratings have it at 4.2 stars from 310 reviews. </p>
<p> We're at an interesting crossroads in Android hardware. Manufacturers are switching from MicroUSB for power and wired data to the newer, more capable USB-C standard. But the rush to provide mobile users with hundreds of millions of new cables and chargers creates, well, a rush. We've already seen some USB-C cables and other hardware that have been substandard, sometimes with disastrous results. So civic-minded geeks, including independent researcher Nathan K., have been looking into the performance and power output of popular cables. </p>
<p> Are you still looking to buy some USB-A to USB-C cables? Maybe you didn't jump on board last year's Nexus phones or the LG G5 or HTC M10 or any of the new devices being released with USB-C, but you're eying that new Note7 and you can't wait to have it in your hands... except you need new cables. Or maybe you already have a couple of cables but you need moar, much moar, for the car and the portable charger you keep in your backpack and your Macbook/Pixel C and the nightstand and the dock at work, etc... </p>
<p> While there has yet to be a major smartphone announced with a USB Type C connector, we know they're coming. As are tablets, laptops, and pretty much every other kind of USB gadget you can imagine. This is our quick guide to USB Type C (and USB 3.1, which are actually not the same thing), which will go over the benefits of the new standard, as well as discuss the kind of cables you'll probably want to buy in the next couple of years as it is adopted. </p>
<p> Why are we switching to a new port configuration? Are my old cables going to be useless? </p>

<p> It's the week before Thanksgiving and you're probably about to head off to the relatives or to a friend's apartment to share in a meal, some laughs, and maybe a good dose of anxiety.

<p> The second-generation Pixel phones have had some struggles. Following user reports of problems with the OLED display, strange effects when taking photos of LED lights, seemingly muted microphones, a mysterious buzzing noise, random reboots, and crashes in Android Auto mode, it has been a tumultuous time for Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL owners. Multiple users in the Google Product Forums have now claimed that the USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapters are not working on their phones, with sound instead being played through the device. </p>
<p> USB-C was supposed to be this savior of all ports, a be-all-end-all of sorts, but so far, I'm honestly lost with the acronyms. USB-C, 3.0 and 3.1 and 3.2, USB-C PD, VESA DisplayPort Alternate Mode, USB SuperSpeed+, and so on... It's becoming increasingly impossible to tell what each one means and what you need to have on your device to make sure it supports fast charging, fast data transfers, external displays, and audio playback. </p>
<p> Here's one more for you to worry about: Digital Audio. If you want your Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL to play music on your third-party USB-C headphones, you need to make sure those support digital audio. </p>

<p> usb-c earbuds </p>
<p> As the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack fades into our collective memory, cheap headphones are harder and harder to find. Bluetooth buds are great, but you have to charge 'em. The convenience of wired buds lives on, though, in USB-C. You don't have to spend a lot to get a decent pair, either. Here are five solid picks under $50. </p>
<p> OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei recently confirmed that the company's forthcoming 6T won't have a headphone jack. It'll include an adapter in the box, but what kind of self-respecting company would OnePlus be if it didn't also sell you a solution? Enter the Type-C Bullets, a new pair of wired earbuds that'll plug right into the new phone's only remaining port. </p>
<p> With more and more phones dropping the venerable 3.5mm headphone jack, one might have hoped that more USB-C accessories, notably earphones, would have appeared by now. Sadly, the market of reliable, trustworthy options is still quite small and the ones you do find aren't cheap. If you own a Pixel 2 XL, for instance, you probably understand how frustrating the dongle situation can be... if you can even get one at time of writing. </p>

<p> With more and more phones dropping the venerable 3.5mm headphone jack, one might have hoped that more USB-C accessories, notably earphones, would have appeared by now. Sadly, the market of reliable, trustworthy options is still quite small and the ones you do find aren't cheap. If you own a Pixel 2 XL, for instance, you probably understand how frustrating the dongle situation can be... if you can even get one at time of writing. </p>
<p> It's a sad state of affairs, but smartphones nowadays are skipping the 3.5mm headset plug for valid, and sometimes not-so-valid, reasons. If your Android phone is following that trend, you have two solutions to listen to music: Bluetooth and USB-C. Today's deals on Libratone might help you save on both of these options. </p>
<p> It's sad, but the headphone jack is being included on fewer and fewer phones every year. Ever since Apple started the trend of relying on one connector with the iPhone 7, Google, HTC, Motorola, and more companies have all released flagship devices without the 3.5mm jack that all of us knew and loved. </p>
<p> Like many flagship phones, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL aren't cheap. But while companies like Samsung and Apple try to make you feel a little better about your $700-1000 purchase by including a pair of earphones in the box, Google doesn't. However, some seemingly preproduction packaging that one guy got inside his Verizon Pixel 2's box indicates that Google had at least been seriously considering it. </p>

<p> USB-C headset </p>
<p> When Stadia launched last year, it was a cool idea in theory that felt a bit lacking in practice. Seemingly simple things like using the Stadia controller wirelessly with phones, or plugging in USB-C headsets, weren't supported at first. Luckily, Google is working on addressing these issues with its cloud gaming service; the controller started working with phones and laptops earlier this summer, and now it looks like USB-C headsets are usable as well. </p>

<p> As you might have already heard, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL don't have headphone jacks. It's disappointing, yes, but Google has a solution if you need to charge and listen to your tunes at the same time.

<p> The magic of USB-C is its versatility, meaning it can be simple to use your phone or computer's USB-C port for more than just charging and the occasional data transfer. Of course, sometimes the device you want to connect to doesn't have a USB-C port. This weekend's giveaway allows you to use a host device with USB-C to stream video up to 4K and 60Hz refresh rate over HDMI. </p>
<p> Sometimes it's all about convenience, and what's more convenient than tossing your phone onto a wireless charger? If that sentiment strikes a chord with you, then this giveaway is likely to please. Right now Android Police and Choetech are giving 20 lucky winners a Choetech wireless fast charger, as well as their choice of either a USB-C to DisplayPort cable, or a USB-C to HDMI cable. </p>
<p> Whether you prefer things wireless or connected, either way, there's something to love. And if you don't want to wait for the giveaway to end, you can even pick up both the USB-C to HDMI and USB-C to DisplayPort cables now without exclusive coupon codes. </p>

<p> usb game controller </p>
<p> When touchscreen controls don’t cut it for games, you’re left with two options: switch to a dedicated gaming machine or add your own hardware controls. For the past few years, Wikipad has sold its Gamevice detachable controllers which work with several Samsung Galaxy models and iPhones. The Google devices were sadly left out of the fray, until now as the company released a version that supports the Pixel 2, 3, and their XL variants. </p>
<p> With the arrival of Honeycomb 3.1 came some really nice features, including one of the most useful to date: USB host support. This allows users to plug thumb drives, external hard drives, mice, keyboards, and more into their tablets and use them with little-to-no hassle. </p>
<p> Out of the many uses for USB host support, adding a game controller to your tablet is a simple way to have more fun with your device -- it improves the experience with a lot of games, especially if, like me, you hate touchscreen controls. While most tablet manufacturers have included gamepad support in their devices right out of the box, such is not the case with the Galaxy Tab 10.1 (possibly because of the lack of a dedicated USB port), but not to worry -- if you're looking to use a USB game controller on your Tab, there is a way to get it working, granted you have the 30-pin USB adapter. </p>

<p> usb hub </p>
<p> Usually, we aren't too into Kickstarter stuff here at AP. No small number of crowdfunded endeavors have failed to materialize in the past, and too many of them are merely rebadged OEM goods. But in this brave new dongle-filled world, the HyperDrive has caught our eye. It's a combo USB-C hub, Qi charger, and phone stand all in one. And, unlike many Kickstarter promises, this one has already hit its funding goal. </p>
<p> Craving some juice? How about some lemon juice? Well, I've got ZeroLemons to satiate you and your phone. I know that sounds like a bad deal, but ZeroLemon actually makes really good products that help you avoid any situation in which your phone could turn into a useless juiceless lemon. And today's deals get you some of the best value for your bucks from the company's portfolio. </p>
<p> First up is the 10,000mAh solar battery charger that we've seen sit at $26 at its lowest. It has 2A and 1A output ports so you can charge one phone or accessory faster than another, although this isn't Quick Charge. </p>
<p> I don't think any computer I have ever owned has had enough USB ports to satisfy my needs. Mics, headsets, keyboards, cameras, cell phones, and this thing all demand access to my ports and there are simply not enough to go around. </p>
<p> That's why I'm so glad that USB hubs exist — They increase the number of connections at your disposal and keep your gadgets from fighting gladiator style death matches to determine who will take the last computer port (actually, that would be kinda awesome). </p>
<p> There are so many gadgets nowadays that charge via USB that having a separate AC outlet dedicated to each one can be difficult, if not impossible. A multi-port hub can definitely solve this problem, though. Personally, I have a 5-port charger on my living room table where I have my G Watch's charging connector, a microUSB cord for my phones, and the cable to charge the heart rate strap I use during workouts all in one place. This deal on an ORICO 5-port hub for $10.99 might be just the reason you need to streamline your charging game. </p>
<p> As you can see in the image above, there are two "super charger" ports and three "universal." </p>

<p> It's one thing to push a crazy amount of power to a device, it's entirely another to do it safely. Thankfully for those of you planning to get a Galaxy S20, the USB-IF has just rubber-stamped the whole Galaxy S20 series as "Fast Charger Certified." When plugged into similarly certified USB accessories and chargers, you can rest a little bit easier knowing that all those watts it's sucking down won't go terribly wrong. </p>
<p> The USB Type-C marketplace is no longer the shitshow that it once was, though it still pays to be careful when buying a new charger or battery. Much of the time, this means having to pony up a bit extra for the properly rated offerings, but that's not always the case. Nekteck's 90W USB-C Power Delivery charger with built-in cable is certified by the USB-IF, and it's only $25.99 on Amazon. </p>
<p> Yesterday, the USB Promoter Group revealed the next evolution of its ubiquitous peripheral spec: USB4. The new specification, which is still a draft in the final stages of review, is based on Intel's Thunderbolt 3 protocol, delivering up to 40Gbps throughput over existing, Thunderbolt spec-certified Type-C cables. That's twice as fast as current USB 3.2 maximums. It's also backward compatible with existing USB 3.2, 2.0, and Thunderbolt 3 specs and devices. </p>
<p> Today the USB-IF, the non-profit behind the USB standard's marketing and specifications, revealed the formal launch of its "USB Type-C™ Authentication Program," originally announced back in 2016. The optional program "defines cryptographic-based authentication for USB Type-C chargers and devices." If that sounds like a thinly veiled euphemism for hardware DRM to you, that's because it is. </p>
<p> Adoption of the new USB-C port standard has commenced surprisingly rapidly. While there are some holdouts in the world of budget phones, every major smartphone manufacturer but Apple has embraced the new port, even if across various levels of the USB standard or support for features like USB Power Delivery (USB-PD). </p>
<p> USB-C brought long-awaited features like a fully-reversible connector, increased charging speeds without "breaking" the USB standard, support for USB 3.0 and 3.1 features (well, for phones that have them), and the increasing adoption of things like USB audio. USB-C is, frankly, a no-brainer. </p>
<p> So, among Android Police readers, I'm curious how many of you have smartphones with USB-C ports. </p>

<p> Another day, another deal and today's comes from Amazon's Gold Box sale. Certain PNY flash storage items are on sale for up to 50% off. These include flash drives, SD cards, microSD cards, and OTG accessories. Most of the storage media are pretty high capacity, too. </p>
<p> If your modern phone or tablet doesn't have a MicroSD card slot like many Android flagships and mid-tier devices released in the last couple of years, you have a few limited options to transfer data between it and other devices or computers. There's Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and finally there's USB OTG. That should be the fastest and if you have a flash drive with both a USB and a MicroUSB connector, you're set. If you don't, you can pick one of the best ones for cheap on Amazon today. </p>
<p> SanDisk's Ultra USB 3.0 flash drives with a MicroUSB connector are on sale now. </p>
<p> One of the cooler and, in my opinion, underutilized features present in many modern Android flagships is the ability to use MicroUSB OTG devices to quickly transfer media. If this is a feature that you have wanted to take advantage of for a while, but just haven't gotten around to picking up a OTG thumb drive, then now might be a good time to finally grab one. </p>
<p> Today you can buy a 64GB SanDisk USB 2.0 OTG flash drive for just under $19. That's enough room to store a whole lot of photos of cats. If you aren't sure if your device is compatible with USB OTG you can check the list below to find out — you don't even have to Google it. </p>
<p> Are you a new owner of the Samsung Galaxy S6 and have expandable storage withdrawal? Maybe things aren't so bad, since Best Buy is running a killer deal on a tiny flash drive that will plug straight into your phone. Of course, the main negative to a microUSB device would be the difficulty getting files onto it, but there's an easy way to deal with that: this one also has a standard USB plugin. </p>
<p> It might not be quite like having a microSD card, but for quick and relatively painless moving of files between PC and phone/tablet, this is nearly ideal. </p>
<p> The Moto G isn't a high-end phone, but it has sold extremely well for the company. So it's no surprise it continues to get some update love. This phone is already on Android 4.4.2, but it's getting a maintenance update to fix a few annoying issues. </p>
<p> SanDisk is announcing a new product today, the Ultra Dual USB Drive, or Dual Drive for short. It's not the only USB key with both a USB and microUSB plug, but this is not exactly a saturated product category either. The Dual Drive has a super-compact form factor and should support most Android devices without issue. We got a unit to take a look at a little early, so let's get up close and personal. </p>
<p> If you've never heard of Leef Bridge, it's an upcoming flash drive that doesn't discriminate between PCs and smartphones by having a USB port on one end and a MicroUSB port on the other. The company pushes the device as the quickest way to move files between a computer and a phone - and now it just got even faster. Leef Bridge has made the leap from USB 2.0 to USB 3.0, which means zippier file transfers for anyone who picks up the flash drive once it goes on sale in January. </p>
<p> To be more specific, Leef Bridge is coming to store shelves on January 19th and will be exclusively available through RadioShack for 60 days. </p>
<p> Is rooting phones a hassle for you? Do you want to root somebody else's phone (whether they're willing or not), but don't want to deal with that whole pesky "getting permission" part? (Or dealing with teaching them how to go about doing it?) </p>
<p> A new app over at XDA by wchill may have you covered. I say "may" because it's still in a very early beta stage, but the response so far from the community has been pretty positive. </p>
<p> Root Transmission requires three things: 1.) a rooted Android device with USB hosting capability, 2.) a USB OTG cable, 3.) a one-click rooting script for the device you're trying to root. </p>
<p> On devices without a full-size USB port (read: most), using external USB peripherals - like keyboards, mice, game controllers, etc. - is basically a non-experience. In order to use said accessories, you need an OTG cable, which essentially converts the microUSB port of a device into a full-size port. </p>
<p> Right now, you can get one such cable from Amazon for $0.83. Yes, eighty-three cents. That's crazy cheap. Not only is this cable useful and affordable, but the shipping's free, too. You really have no excuse not to buy this right now. So do yourself a favor and hit the link below. </p>

Luckily TopGreener offers the perfect solution thanks to its high-speed in-wall portable chargers that will quickly and safely energize your devices at the maximum speeds possible. This is why we are glad to announce that AP has teamed up with TopGreener to give away five bundles of charging accessories to ensure that all of your devices always have enough power. </p>
<p> Normal wall outlets are great and all, but ones with integrated USB ports can be very handy. If you feel like breaking out the screwdriver and upgrading the plugs in your home, you can grab the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 - a whopping $19 off the original price. </p>

<p> Charging all your Android and other gadgets has become decidedly less complicated over the years with the rise of USB Type C and USB Power Delivery. Deciding which charger to buy, though, can be a bit of a headache: there are endless brands, supported outputs, and form factors to consider. We've put together a list of the chargers we think combine the best of all worlds: good output, compact form factors, reputable brands, and strong value. Here are our picks. </p>
<p> Samsung announced a slew of accessories for its new Galaxy S20 line-up yesterday, but failed to mention the one gadget everyone needs these days: battery packs. They may not be as sexy as LED or Kvadrat cases, but they can be real lifesavers, and soon Samsung will be selling an powerful pair of power banks with up to 25W USB-C output. </p>
<p> Whether you're puttering around town, traveling for a work conference, or hanging out at a public event, the last thing you ever want to see is your phone battery dipping below that 20% mark. For these cases when you don't have a wall charger handy, you need a reliable portable battery that packs enough power to recharge your mobile devices not just once, but multiple times, if necessary. To help you find the best of the best, we've put together a list of our five favorite USB-C Power Delivery charging banks that can top off all your gadgets on the go. </p>
<p> Whether you travel a lot or simply want to avoid multiplying the number of wall chargers, getting one with several outlets can be a good idea. If you're looking for a reliable one with USB-C compatibility, you're in luck, as Aukey's 36W USB-C PD wall charger is down to $19 with this deal. </p>
<p> Running out of power when you're on the go can be a real pain, but this RAVPower external battery has got you covered: It can charge a variety of devices thanks to its three ports and high capacity. It usually sells for $60, but you can now get it for $10 off on Amazon. </p>
<p> AUKEY, the company known for its innovative charging solutions, recently released its most versatile series of products yet. Omni-Power was designed to consolidate all of the latest accelerated charging standards into a single USB Power Delivery solution, bestowing virtually any modern device with fast charging capabilities. Now your devices can wield that same power. Here's how you can enter to win one of five AUKEY Omni-Power bundles. </p>
<p> You've probably seen wall outlets with built-in USB ports, but this outlet from TopGreener is pretty special. Not only does it have a USB Type-A connector, but the connector supports Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0, and there's an additional Type-C port. The wall outlet is now $33.99 on Amazon, a $6 reduction from the original price. </p>
<p> You can never have too many chargers around, and the Aukey 46W Type-C brick should meet most if not all of your needs. It can juice up laptops like the Pixelbook and MacBook as well as phones like the Pixel. It's on sale right now for $27.99, but this is an Amazon Lightning Deal—it's going fast. </p>
<p> We're well into the era of USB Type-C now, but not all Type-C chargers are created equal. It can be hard to find an inexpensive spare charger with support for USB-PD. That's the charging standard used on the Pixels, Essential Phone, Pixelbook, Macbook, and more. You can get some of Aukey's USB-PD chargers today for as much as 25% off with coupon codes. </p>
<p> When you travel, you get a good idea of the stuff it takes to keep your lifestyle going. It's one thing to be surrounded by all the things you need at home, but it's another to selectively pack them into a limited space with the expectation of maintaining the same standards. For me, the limiting factor has always been power: charging all my stuff means toting a pile of cables and bricks around. In fact, that's one of the biggest advantages of the growing ubiquity of USB-C and the PD spec. </p>
<p> So when I saw Satechi's 75W Travel Charger, with one USB-C PD and three USB-A ports, I knew I was interested, and it didn't disappoint. </p>

<p> Filling up several devices simultaneously can be a pain. Thankfully, some wall chargers come with several ports, making it simpler to plug in two phones or tablets at once. Aukey's product, which can deliver up to 18W, is now down to just $7 on Amazon, which is 55% off compared to its traditional MSRP. </p>

<p> Whether you charge multiple devices by your bedside or you prefer to pack light while traveling, there's no greater convenience than owning a single charger that can manage multiple devices at once. It's even better when you can find a charging solution that's compatible with both USB-C and USB-A connections. Today you can pick up this highly rated RAVPower PD Pioneer 61W charger for $23 ($13 off) at Amazon. </p>
<p> Nubia, of Red Magic fame, just teased an image of a phone charging on Weibo. In it, the device claims to be topping itself up at a ridiculous 80W speed. That's a pretty impressive number, and faster than anything else we've seen or heard of in a phone before, but it also raises some concerns. It claims to be doing this via USB PD, according to the image provided, but if it is, it's breaking the Power Delivery spec to do it. </p>
<p> AUKEY, the company known for its innovative charging solutions, recently released its most versatile series of products yet. Omni-Power was designed to consolidate all of the latest accelerated charging standards into a single USB Power Delivery solution, bestowing virtually any modern device with fast charging capabilities. Now your devices can wield that same power. Here's how you can enter to win one of five AUKEY Omni-Power bundles. </p>
<p> Need to charge your phone or laptop quick and fast? A good 30-watt wall charger can make a lot of sense, but even with recent innovations, the bulk that get sold are still kinda big — if you're plugging into a packed power strip, you're often negotiating for space. But there are ways to get around that trouble and one of them is Aukey's USB-C wall charger, now on sale at Amazon for more than 30% off. </p>
<p> Xiaomi recently impressed battery worrywarts with its 100-watt Super Charge Turbo solution, but has yet to officially announce a phone with that technology. But when it comes to connecting up a couple of things with a USB cable, there's more to the equation than just power. Samsung is attempting to push that point by introducing a couple of power management chips today that can push 100W, but also puts priority on encryption. </p>
<p> Chargers usually only use one type of fast charging technology - be it Qualcomm Quick Charge, OnePlus DashCharge, USB Power Delivery, or something else. If you want something that can charge nearly everything at a fast rate, ZeroLemon's all-in-one brick is for you, and it's $30 off right now from Amazon. </p>
<p> In its latest revision of the Android Compatibility Definition Document, Google has laid down some rather interesting rules not related to Android itself, but rather common device hardware. In the CDD, a new section has appeared that specifically relates to the USB Type C standard and charging - a subject that has become increasingly thorny with the proliferation of numerous proprietary fast charging standards. </p>
<p> While the section for now is labeled as "STRONGLY RECOMMENDED," Google is signaling clearly that it could become mandatory: "in future Android versions we might REQUIRE all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers." </p>
<p> We reached out to Google, and it turns out this was just a marketing materials mistake: the official specification page for the Pixel has been updated to correctly state that the phones support USB-PD charging from 15-18 watts, as opposed to simply 18 watts. </p>

<p> usb transfer </p>
<p> Android 8.1 Oreo has rolled out to the Moto X4 and its Android One brother, but the update has brought with it a pretty major issue: nonfunctional USB transfer. That means that Android Auto and ADB, among other things, are currently not working. Luckily, there's somewhat of a workaround, as well as a fix on the way. </p>
<p> One strength of iOS is that everything works seamlessly together. If you have iTunes installed on your computer, it doesn't take much effort to get music over to your iPhone. With Play Music, Google has taken a different approach for Android users looking at an out of the box experience, and if you don't have the internet connection to rely on the cloud for music listening, it's less than ideal. doubleTwist takes the iTunes approach, and with the reinvented doubleTwist Sync app that's now available for Windows, it looks more promising than ever. </p>
<p> doubleTwist Sync has a stylish and simple UI that delivers easy access to new and old features alike. </p>

<p> Yubico is praised as the maker of some of the best physical security keys currently out there, but the company isn't resting on its laurels. Today, it has announced the latest addition to its YubiKey 5 series, the $55 YubiKey 5C NFC. It can be seen as an advanced version of the regular 5C, and it's the company's first key to feature both USB-C and NFC, which might make it its most universal one yet when it comes to phones. </p>
<p> You might already have a few USB Type-C wall adapters around your home, but third-party options can give you more features (and sometimes a smaller size) than the chargers included with phones and tablets. Choetech's 65W USB-PD wall adapter offers enough power for anything from earbuds to ultrabooks, and it's now just $21.99 on Amazon. That's $13 off the usual price. </p>
<p> Even though most of us probably weren't driving quite as much as we had hoped to this holiday weekend, it never hurts to have a high-quality USB charger in your car. Even better still, if you can find one that's both versatile enough to be compatible most devices and can fill those batteries quickly enough to be useful, even on shorter trips. If that sounds like just the thing you've been looking for, you can pick up an Aukey 33W car adapter with QC 3.0 for only $11 on Amazon with coupon code BENN6T7F — saving yourself $7.98 by doing so. </p>
<p> As game-changing as USB Type-C has been, most of us still have at least one or two devices lying around that require us to keep a USB Type-A charger handy as well. For simplicity's sake, why not have one charger that can accept both that can also output enough power to charge whatever device you need quickly and safely? Today, we have a deal that can help with just that. Right now, you can grab a dual-port Aukey 30W USB- C PD 2.0/18W Quick Charge 3.0 compatible charger from Amazon for only $16.34—saving $26.65 off the regular price of $42.99. </p>

<p> Fast charging can be a difficult topic to wrap your head around. There are a lot of competing standards, all with different cables and power adapters, but one of the most popular is Qualcomm's 'Quick Charge' technology. There are different versions with different charging speeds, but QC 2.0 and 3.0 are still common to find in today's phones and tablets. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/03/19 11:46am PDTon Mar 19, 2020 and last updated 2020/04/27 9:22am PDTon Apr 27, 2020. </p>
<p> We live in interesting times—most of us are staying home to slow the spread of coronavirus. Many people are also trying to jury-rig a home office to get work done. That might mean you've got devices like laptops, phones, and tablets floating around that need charging, and you probably want to avoid the inevitable tangle of cables. A charging station can come in handy during these trying times, and here are the best ones you can get. </p>
<p> According to a recent set of benchmarks conducted by the folks at Android Authority, Google’s latest Pixels suffer a bit of a problem with file transfer speed over USB Type-C. Although Google bills the port as supporting USB 3.0 transfer speeds, something about the phone’s configuration results in nearly half the speed compared to other recent phones, like the OnePlus 7T Pro and Galaxy S10e. </p>
<p> One of the advantages of everything moving to USB Type-C is that you can use many of the same accessories with all your devices. However, it's still pretty common to run into a PC with no Type-C ports at all, which is where SanDisk's new USB drive comes in. </p>
<p> Despite being late to the party, the AirPods undoubtedly managed to remodel the true wireless earbuds category. Though they play nice only with Apple devices, many Android users have secretly wanted those iconic white stems sticking out of their ears. To fill that gap, Realme, like many other brands, has stepped in with a pair of AirPods (1st gen) clones, called Buds Air, that bring a few premium features to the table without breaking the bank. </p>

<p> usb wall outlet </p>
<p> Wouldn't life be just a little simpler if you could plug your phone right into the wall with just a USB cable? Actually, you can. If you're about that kind of convenience, here's a deal for you: Topgreener's dual USB-C wall outlet is currently $27.99 on Amazon, down from its historical price of $34.99 — a hearty discount of $7. </p>
<p> These days, many — if not most — of the electronics we charge or plug in use USB. Sure, your lamp and your fridge probably don't have a USB plug, but your phone, tablet, bluetooth speaker, portable battery pack, and maybe even laptop likely do. It's sort of an overkill to use a whole outlet just to plug in a single USB cable, which is why there are now several places where you can buy USB wall outlets that you can install directly on a wall. </p>
<p> Normal wall outlets are great and all, but ones with integrated USB ports can be very handy. If you feel like breaking out the screwdriver and upgrading the plugs in your home, you can grab the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 - a whopping $19 off the original price. </p>

<p> Throughout Glass' gradual expansion to more and more Explorers, there's been a lot of talk about using the device professionally in demanding environments, particularly healthcare (and firefighting). Wearable Intelligence is a company looking to tackle the former, along with energy industries, by building firmware for Glass that replaces its usual Android installation with one customized to fit the needs of those industries. </p>
<p> Wearable Intelligence says its healthcare solution is HIPAA compliant, and from their promotional video, it looks undoubtedly impressive. </p>
<p> Google's official Glass YouTube channel released its first video today – a minute long introduction to Glass' most basic controls. The video is titled Glass How-to: Getting Started, which leads this writer to believe there may be more How-to's in the works. </p>
<p> Impressively well-produced and perfectly simple, the video discusses Glass' gestures – tapping, swiping forward, backward, and down, and gives a very digestible explanation of the device's time-based card interface. </p>
<p> With another week comes another entry in our new "What We Use" series. This time it's my turn. I may not have an eternal turtle or a crazy-sophisticated head razor, but the fourth time's a charm, right? Here's a rundown of the hardware, software, and miscellaneous whatnots that help me do what I do. </p>
<p> The Hardware </p>
<p> My Laptop </p>
<p> Unlike my colleagues, I rely primarily on my laptop. Having found myself either in class or overseas during the past four years, re-upping my old desktop build was neither cost-effective nor practical, so I opted for a beefy laptop solution. </p>
<p> Does everyone remember the new keyboard called 8pen that arrived earlier this month and took the Android community by storm, both negatively and positively? I don't think I've ever witnessed so many widely different opinions about whether a keyboard is completely useless or a work of a genius until 8pen came out. Brian, for example, loves it, and I absolutely despise it. </p>
<p> There is one reason to install and use this rotary keyboard, however, and it is a good one. </p>

<p> used phones </p>
<p> With new phones becoming ever more expensive over recent years, it makes sense to consider used devices. Price retention is relatively low for Android handsets, so you can get the almost latest and greatest for much less. Thanks to outstanding budget products like the Pixel 3a and a few OnePlus devices, there are great options at almost any price point. Here's a roundup of some of the best phones in four categories ranging from sub-$150 to $350+. </p>
<p> Depreciation is great - not so much for people who purchase things new, but definitely for those of us who get to swoop in and grab a slightly-used item for a fraction of the original price. This is the case for cars, furniture, tools, and as we'll be discussing today, smartphones. Whether you're looking into the used market because you cracked your screen, you need to buy a phone for a relative/friend, or you just want the best performance for the money, this updated guide will help you find the best entrants at different price brackets. We made one for spring 2017, and here's your fall 2017 edition. </p>
<p> There are a lot of smartphone trade-in programs from both retailers and carriers, and to be frank, they suck. In just about every situation you can get more for your current gadgets by selling them yourself on secondary markets like Craigslist, eBay, or Swappa. The only reason to sell gadgets to carriers (or any retailer) is the convenience factor. But T-Mobile is positioning itself as the self-styled people's champion of smartphone trade-ins, or at the very least, the best option among its competitors. </p>
<p> A new press release says that T-Mobile intends to rigorously "track the market," adjusting its trade-in prices every day to make sure it stays ahead of carrier alternatives. </p>
<p> Update 6/24: In a statement to Tmonews, T-Mobile has confirmed that it has a system in place that allows users (and UpgradeSwap) to check the IMEI to verify whether or not the device is being financed. You can find that tool here. </p>
<p> If a customer wants to purchase a T-Mobile phone and is checking the IMEI number, they should be using our tool for the correct information. </p>
<p> Update 2 6/24: In this ever-increasing back-and-forth battle, UpgradeSwap has now responded with a claim that T-Mo's own system doesn't even work correctly half the time. They even provided us with a screenshot of the system showing an invalid IMEI error on a T-Mobile Galaxy S4. </p>
<p> It's easy for the tech world to forget that not everyone is looking to buy a new $200 phone on contract every six months. Vodafone UK hasn't forgotten, though. The British carrier is launching a new service to help put top-tier smartphones in the hands of pay-as-you-go customers by selling them lightly used hardware. More specifically, phones exchanged within the carrier's 7-day return window. </p>
<p> If you're buying a phone without a contract, the up-front cost would be slightly cheaper, as one would expect from a used device. For those concerned, stores do check to ensure the mobiles still work, wipe any data or settings, and package them up with any requisite accessories. </p>

<p> In its everlasting quest to get information that matters to you, Google announced at I/O 2018 a new Assistant experience that would consolidate the stuff you care about most in a central Feed-like overview page. With a vague launch time of "this summer," we didn't have any exact timeline for the feature's launch, but just as the calendar flipped over to "summer" officially, we received one tip of the new interface going live for a reader. </p>
<p> Each version of Android is assigned a tasty treat to identify it by: Donut, Eclair, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean, Jelly Bean, Jelly Bean, KitKat, so on and so forth. This is great for casual reference, but short build codes are provided to refer to more specific versions. This has been the case since before the DRC83 build of Android. Don't know which one that is? Check out our new Android Build Number Date Calculator to find out! </p>
<p> That's right, folks. With our new tool, all you have to do is type in the build number, and it will spit the version number and build date out for you in a more easily readable format. </p>
<p> In the modern world, watching TV shows isn't what it used to be. Back in the old days (or the present for some), shows simply existed at a certain time and you tuned in when they aired, and then they were cancelled and then you never heard from them again. Today, though, it's not uncommon for most viewers to discover a show a few seasons in and then find their way through the backlog of episodes. It can get overwhelming when you need to sort through which shows are still on, which shows you've seen, and how many more episodes you have to go. </p>
<p> If you're anything like me, you text constantly. There are times, however, that I put my phone down and hop on the computer to do some more in-depth tasks or just enjoy some good, old-fashioned big-screen browsing. When I'm doing that, it's usually a pain to receive a text message, have to dig out my phone, open the messaging app, and use a tiny keyboard to reply, even though I'm sitting at a much larger, easier to use keyboard. Well, that's not a problem anymore - now I've got Texty. </p>
<p> Texty is an app that will forward your text messages directly from your phone to your desktop (specifically, Chrome) using cloud magic and allow you to reply from your computer through your phone's messaging app. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/06/16 5:00am PDTon Jun 16, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/20 9:52am PDTon Jun 20, 2020. </p>
<p> A lot of us have to juggle more than one Google account these days, be it for work, school, or personal stuff. On Chrome OS, where user profiles are intertwined with Google accounts, managing those can feel overwhelming, especially since there are multiple ways to tackle the problem: You can create two users for two accounts, add two Google accounts to one user, or build a combination of the two. There are advantages and disadvantages to all of these solutions, so let's dive into what you need to consider for your setup. </p>
<p> Everyone knows someone who has made the switch from iPhone to Android. This latest convert will surprise you though. It’s GoogleBot – the all-important web crawler used by Google. </p>
<p> GoogleBot is a vital cog in the Google search engine. In its most simplified form, it works by going from website to website and sucking up as much information as it possibly can. The data is then passed to other Google algorithms, where it is processed, ranked, and transformed into search results. </p>
<p> In order for GoogleBot to get all perspectives of a website, it masquerades as different types of devices – a desktop browser, a feature-phone browser, and a smartphone browser. </p>
<p> Along with a handful of new tablets, Amazon has officially announced Fire OS 4 (codenamed Sangria), which it says adds hundreds of new features to the "content-forward" operating system. </p>
<p> First and foremost, Amazon says the user interface in Fire OS has gotten a facelift. Amazon hasn't gone into detail in describing its UI changes, but visual tweaks are certainly welcome to an interface that can at times seem scattered. </p>
<p> Besides that, Amazon is touting new features like ASAP, Smart Suspend, and the addition of individual user profiles to make for easier sharing among families. </p>
<p> ASAP stands for "Advanced Streaming And Protection," a feature from Amazon's Fire TV that attempts to predict what you want to watch next and queue it up automatically for playback as soon as you get done with the current content. </p>
<p> While Instagram is busy rolling out its own "beautiful" (also "gorgeous") video functionality, the folks at Vine are busy making good on the "rapid, significant updates" they promised for this summer, releasing version 1.1 of the service's Android app today. </p>
<p> Responding directly to users' feedback, Vine now includes a "clear cache" option inside the app's settings. Previously, users complained that the app's cache ate up staggering amounts of space. </p>
<p> Besides that, the update brings integration with Facebook, the ability to search for users and individual hashtags (another user request), improvements to capture and sync, and of course "other bug fixes and UI improvements." </p>
<p> To be perfectly honest, I'm not much of an e-mag guy. I tried Google Currents for a while, but never quite saw the utility of it, and so quickly transitioned back to my beloved Feedly and Google Reader. That's not to say I haven't realized the limitations of RSS many times, though, especially as certain websites I follow look to integrate more multimedia into articles. (Having to use Chrome to listen to audio or video in a weird custom player is really frustrating.) And concededly, apps like Currents look a thousand times better than feeds, which are traditionally text-heavy. </p>
<p> A major update to Flipboard, released today to Google Play, may just get me to reconsider magazine-style news apps. </p>
<p> If you've been paying attention to TV Guide's official app, you know that it's needed some attention for a while. Its UI through version 2.x was an outdated pastiche of Gingerbread tabs and gradated iconography desperately in need of a redesign (and support for 4.0+). Today, TV Guide has fulfilled that need (for the most part), bringing to the Play Store TV Guide Mobile version 3.0. The update also brought "many cool new features" to the app, which we'll discuss momentarily. First though, check out the difference between the old and new interfaces. </p>
<p> Amazon's AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a hugely important web service that is responsible for much of Amazon's functionality, and plenty of content you look at every day (remember that time Reddit, Flipboard, Netflix, and others simultaneously stuttered in part of the US?). Looking to keep AWS account holders connected to their services and abreast of service health while on the go, Amazon released its official AWS Console app to the Play Store today. </p>
<p> Amazon calls the console a "good companion" to the web interface, and it brings much of the key functionality AWS users will be looking for, from seeing a general overview of your EC2 (Elastic Cloud Computing) instances and CloudWatch alarms to the ability to stop or reboot EC2 instances, to viewing AWS service health statuses. </p>
<p> In its One X+ announcement, HTC also announced some changes to Sense. While none were groundbreaking (so don't expect a visual overhaul) and not a lot of details were revealed, the company did mention a few things were being upgraded. </p>
<p> Protip: the image on the left is gigantic when full-sized. Apparently HTC's target date was September 24. </p>
<p> The camera software seems to have received the bulk of the changes, starting with the front-facer, which now includes Self Portrait mode (previewed below, left). As you'd expect, it makes taking self-shots easier by "detecting the human face at various angles and applying subtle enhancements to skin and eyes" - in other words, it auto-'Shops you. </p>
<p> Today it was learned, through a US Patent and Trademark Office filing, that Google has been granted a patent concerning the logging in of multiple users by facial recognition. </p>
<p> Typically, the granting of yet another tech patent wouldn't be extraordinarily interesting news. But given the fact that Google's latest patent relates to multiple user support, and the fact that code meant for multiple user support has been sitting right under our noses in AOSP for some time now, patent number 8,261,090 is definitely worth discussing. </p>
<p> Without quoting the entire 17,000 word filing, patent '090 essentially covers methods that allow a "computing device" to recognize one or more users' identities based on facial recognition, and then give them access to resources specifically assigned to them. </p>
<p> It's not every day that I get excited when I look at a UI demo, largely because they tend to end up being vaporware. But it's hard to ignore a revolutionary UI when one comes along - and that's exactly what Chameleon is: </p>
<p> Still not sold? Check out this demo video from 2 months ago, when Chameleon was first announced: </p>
<p> It's certainly a stunning UI, and one that manages the rare feat of being equal parts beautiful and functional. But there's a catch: the company initially intended to sell Chameleon to OEMs, but it seems they couldn't find a buyer - so they're taking to Kickstarter. </p>

<p> While Google Stadia needs nothing but your browser to work, the story is different for GeForce Now. Nvidia would like you to install its dedicated application for its game streaming service on Windows and Mac. But ever since GeForce Now is available on Chromebooks, we know that it's capable of running inside Chrome, and where there's a will, there's a way. By spoofing your browser user agent with an official Google tool, you can use GeForce Now right in Chrome on your PC, Mac, or Linux machine — nothing but an extension required. </p>
<p> The user agent string is the part of the browser that identifies itself to websites. It tells sites the browser and browser version number you are using, as well as limited information about your device. However, it has become an ever-growing problem for both users and developers over the past decade, so Google wants to switch to something else. </p>
<p> Everyone knows someone who has made the switch from iPhone to Android. This latest convert will surprise you though. It’s GoogleBot – the all-important web crawler used by Google. </p>
<p> GoogleBot is a vital cog in the Google search engine. In its most simplified form, it works by going from website to website and sucking up as much information as it possibly can.

<p> In order for GoogleBot to get all perspectives of a website, it masquerades as different types of devices – a desktop browser, a feature-phone browser, and a smartphone browser. </p>
<p> For those still wondering whether Android's first Ice Cream Sandwich device will be made by Samsung, there may finally be a definitive answer. A file recently spotted on Sammy's website called "nexusprime.xml" tells us that the answer is yes. </p>
<p> The XML file contains the User Agent Profile for what we are assuming is the Nexus Prime, but there are a few shocking revelations buried within. The first thing that stands out is the screen resolution, which is listed as 480x800. This goes against just about every Nexus Prime rumor we've seen that have indicated a 720p resolution. </p>
<p> Additionally, the file lists an ARM11 processor, and the model number GT-I9250 - a number that we've seen before. </p>
<p> WARNING: This fix is for rooted 3G XOOMs only. The Wi-Fi only version is not supported (yet). </p>
<p> Most XOOM owners will tell you that they love their tablet, but that it does have its annoyances - like the fact that the stock browser loads pages in their "mobile" view by default. What good is a 10 inch screen if you can't load the desktop version of a website? Of course, there is the about:debug fix, but that can be tedious, since you have to reapply it every single time you restart. </p>
<p> Thankfully, sangreal06 over the XDA forums has created a hacked framework-res.apk </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/user-data/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549003" filename="user-data">
<p> Earlier this month, software developer Jeff Johnson wrote about a strange issue he'd discovered that allowed Chrome to keep certain data stored from Google sites like YouTube and Search even after it was supposed to be deleted. This isn't a good look from Google, especially in light of recent events — but the company has responded with an explanation. </p>
<p> Many of our readers should be familiar with Takeout, ostensibly now called "Download your Data," which allows you to back up a copy of all the information associated with your account for most of Google's services. Right now you can even use it to transition your Drive storage between providers, but thanks to the upcoming open-source Data Transfer Project—publicized yesterday in a joint effort with Microsoft, Twitter, and Facebook—that data may someday be as portable as your phone. </p>
<p> Blu has reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over allegations that it afforded Adups, a Chinese device management firm, inordinate access to personally identifiable user information. The FTC's complaint said that Blu misled its customers when the company claimed it had taken appropriate measures to protect user privacy. </p>
<p> Security is a big deal these days. Google understands this, which is why its Safe Browsing team is implementing even more mandates for applications. Apps that handle user or device data will soon have to provide their own privacy policies. If this requirement isn't met, warnings may be shown on users' devices. </p>
<p> Earlier in the month, Google released an official statement on a particularly virulent phishing email imitating Google Docs that was doing the rounds. That same day, coincidentally or not, an update to the Gmail Android app added a special warning page that pops up every time a link in one of the suspect emails is clicked. Now, Google is implementing further changes to help prevent future scams of this type. </p>
<p> There have been rumblings lately regarding suspicious data collection happening with HTC's Evo 3D. For those not familiar, it was recently discovered that a service in the latest update for the Evo 3D collected usage, location, and device information, causing some concern among users and developers alike. </p>
<p> Xda reported today on a statement made by HTC officials which attempts to quell fears surrounding the data collection, letting users know that the data is encrypted and all identifying information is excluded. Additionally HTC clarified that the data is related to opt-in error-reporting, and not simply being collected on a whim. Here's the full text of the statement: </p>
<p> We’ve seen some questions about Sensation and Evo 3D and want to provide more information. </p>
<p> Way back in July, Lookout released the results of a study on app security, and found that many apps have access to user data that they have no need for - suggesting that there was plenty of potential for illicit information use. Two months later, a group of researchers from Intel, Penn State, and Duke came forth with data showing just that: 15 of the 30 apps tested sent GPS data, 7 sent unique hardware information, and a few sent more private information such as phone and SIM numbers. </p>
<p> Fast forward to today - the Wall Street Journal has released the findings of a very similar study they conducted, and the results are surprisingly similar. </p>

<p> user manual </p>
<p> Red Dead Redemption II dropped at midnight on Friday, so if you're reading this, you've probably already put somewhere between a few and 40 hours into it. But in a game of this scale, there's plenty to see, and developer Rockstar Games has released a companion app for smartphones and tablets that'll help you find your way around. </p>
<p> Samsung's most recent Galaxy A-series models were released at the start of this year, way back in January, so it's safe to assume the next generation will make an appearance around the same time early next year. There have been plenty of rumors about the mid-range lineup, and we're pretty sure the naming convention will be changing, with this year's A5 and A7 becoming the A8 and A8+. </p>
<p> We may not know exactly when HTC's first foray into the Android tablet world will launch (though we would guess sooner rather than later), but if you simply cannot wait to crack open that case and tear into the user manual, we have good news for you. A PDF file containing the manual has been leaked, along with a several nice-looking wallpapers. Inside the manual, you'll find a full run-through of Sense 3.0, as well as more information on the Scribe software. </p>
<p> Both the manual and wallpapers are available for download below: </p>

<p> Whether you're browsing different sites or buying something online, you likely rely on an autofill system to enter your usernames, passwords, addresses, and payment details so you don't have to manually type that data every time. Google already offers this in Chrome, but the interface is changing and adopting a more modern look that's anchored to your keyboard. </p>
<p> One of the most exciting changes in Android O is the new Autofill API that would allow password manager apps to register as system-wide providers of autofill services. In layman terms, this means that apps like LastPass, 1Password, Enpass, Dashlane, and others, won't have to use accessibility services or screen overlays anymore as a workaround to fill up your usernames and passwords. Instead, they will have one API that grants them native access to enter your information without too much hassle. </p>
<p> AgileBits has put up a demo of a test version of 1Password, its password manager, which has been updated to benefit from O's Autofill API. </p>
<p> Before you panic, you should know that this isn't a huge deal, and Comcast is aware of the situation and has promised a fix "within a week or two." There, feel better? Good, because if you use the XFINITY app, any other app that has permission to read logs can read your Comcast username and password (aLogCat, for example). </p>
<p> The details, courtesy of aBSuRDiST, who discovered the issue: </p>
<p> My system log shows <userName>[email protected]</userName> and <password>MYPASSWORD</password> on a line that starts with "D/HTTPManager". I read the log using aLogcat (app available in the market). Open aLogcat, press menu and filter for "password". </p>

<p> Seven hundred million is a big number. 700 million of almost anything is a lot, but when you're talking about users, it's the kind of number that makes investors and analysts start to drool. It's also the amount of monthly users that popular alternative messaging app WhatsApp now has, at least according to an announcement by CEO Jan Koum. For context, Facebook initialized a purchase of WhatsApp last February (finalized in October) for approximately 22 billion dollars, when the service reportedly had "only" 450 million users. </p>
<p> WhatsApp still hasn't caught on in North America, at least not to the extent that it has in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. </p>
<p> When it comes to aftermarket keyboards, we're big fans of SwiftKey. The prediction engine is second to none, Flow's gesture typing is full-on awesome, and you can customize it to look however you want. Honestly, what more could you want from a keyboard? It's things like this that have made SK a hit with users around the world. </p>
<p> Given that sort of global success, the folks at Swiftkey compiled a blog post with some fun facts about how users in different regions use the keyboard. Want to know who types the sloppiest? How about who relies on predictions the most? Which country loves Flow? </p>

<p> user reviews </p>
<p> Late last year, Google started showing like and dislike buttons on movie and TV shows' search results card. That allowed it to add its own ratings next to IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. But it was only a percentage of likes based on how many people tapped the thumbs up or down icon, so it didn't provide any context or explanation to the rating, thus making users head elsewhere for a more detailed opinion. </p>
<p> Now it appears that Google is testing a more elaborate rating system with full reviews. You can still like/dislike the movie, but if you scroll down you might also spot a new "Audience reviews" section. </p>
<p> A good review can make all the difference when deciding on an app. But a review is only as good as it is relevant, so Amazon is tweaking the way the Appstore displays them. </p>
<p> The Appstore will start showing reviews that are specific to your device and version number. </p>

<p> As anecdotal evidence of mail theft grows in the US in recent weeks, we're all probably being a little more careful about collecting our mail in a timely manner as we await for important things to arrive, like an envelope from the IRS (the agency sending out Economic Impact Payments). And while the IRS isn't making any sort of direct mail tracking of stimulus checks available, you can at least get a heads up on the day your check will arrive using this handy tool from USPS. It's not infallible, and it won't get every single letter, but it's about the only way you can get any sort of advanced knowledge your check will be hitting your mailbox soon. </p>
<p> Let's face it. All the phones, accessories, and other gadgets you see on this site come from one place: China. Actually, considering more than half a trillion dollars in goods came to the United States from there last year, you can count a helluva lot more stuff in that pile. Knowing how trade relations are between these two countries right now, we might be relieved about electronics tariffs that were supposed to come into effect this Sunday being delayed until mid-December. But there's been another autumn deadline we've been hurdling towards that might just make that Chinese import you're planning to take in be it a case, a battery pack, or a burner phone — more expensive starting next year. </p>
<p> When you think of the US Postal Service, I doubt that the first thing to spring to your mind is "whitewater kayaking." They're more known for shipping (and losing) mail and packages in the US. Well, for whatever reason, the USPS has an app titled "USPS® VR," and instead of an immersive mail-tracking experience (or even a tech demo for, say, the exciting technology behind mail sorting), you get a kayaking trip. </p>

<p> Ustream seems to have found its niche in the live streaming of video. The app lets you broadcast live to any number on viewers of WiFi or mobile data. In the new update, developers seem to have spruced up the joint. Ustream is now much more attractive and should also have better video performance. </p>
<p> Moving right along with today's seemingly unplanned Honeycomb extravaganza, Ustream has pushed an update to its official app that, among other features, adds support for Honeycomb tablets. Now you can watch video streams or broadcast your own right from your tablet. Naturally, the update offers a new interface to take advantage of the large display, have a look: </p>
<p> The update also brings some nice updates for phones, like the ability to move it to the SD cards and improved device support, including the Nexus S running Android 2.3.4. </p>

<p> The award-winning Ustwo Studios is well known for the hit Escher-inspired game Monument Valley, and now Google has enlisted the developer to help show off the Pixel 4's new Motion Sense quick gestures. In Headed South, you play as a bird trying to flock with others while flying through brightly-colored worlds. There's only one problem I've found so far: it doesn't work. </p>
<p> Levels is a new video series from Red Bull that dives into the world of indie gaming. The latest episode reveals that ustwo, the creators of Monument Valley, is currently working on two new games for mobile. Both titles are described as departures from the Monument Valley franchise. </p>
<p> Ustwo's beautiful Monument Valley titles are very clever, satisfying puzzlers, but at $4 and $5 for the original and its sequel, respectively, they're a little pricier than some mobile gamers are comfortable with. If you've been hesitant to try them out, maybe this will entice you: both are currently just 99 cents on the Play Store. </p>
<p> About two months ago ustwo games put Monument Valley 2 up on the Play Store as a pre-registration title. Well, it would appear that they have finally settled on a release date for Android, the 6th of November. So get ready people, because we are really close to finally being able to enjoy the sequel's fresh escher-like puzzle gameplay on Android. </p>
<p> Ustwo, the developer of the popular game Monument Valley (and Sky Kids) has a new app called Face Maker. No, it's not an app for creating human faces, it's an app for designing watch faces for Android Wear. Ustwo is no stranger to the Android Wear world—it has released several other watch face packs in the past, but this is the most configurable yet. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a new puzzle game from noted developer ustwo, Zynga's latest attempt to enslave minions via word games, and another licensed title from Gameloft. Without further ado: </p>
<p> Blip Blup </p>
<p> Developer ustwo has cultivated a reputation for simple, unique titles, and Blip Blup is no exception. </p>
<p> I know what you're thinking: "Oh, no... not another social image sharing app!" And if this were anything like that, I'd share you sentiments. But it's not – it's actually quite refreshing, because this app focuses solely on sharing and not at all on social. </p>
<p> Here's the gist: you take a pic – called a Rando in this case – and send it anonymously to someone in a completely random place elsewhere in the world. In return, you also get a Rando. And you must send one to get one. All transfers are completely anonymous – you won't know who got your Rando, and likewise won't know who sent the one you got. </p>

<p> utorrent </p>
<p> One month after BitTorrent's update with a dark theme and bottom navigation, uTorrent is getting the same treatment on Android. The changes are live as part of version 6.1.4, which began rolling out a few days ago. </p>
<p> The µTorrent client on Android has hundreds of millions of downloads, but that's not surprising. People love downloading Linux ISOs, right? Starting today, there's a beta program for the µTorrent app, and it'll let you stream your "Linux ISOs" immediately instead of downloading them. </p>
<p> Those torrents aren't going to download themselves. You're going to want yourself a solid bittorrent client, and since you're running Android, you're in luck. The BitTorrent app underwent a big 2.0 redesign just last month, and now µTorrent is starting to do the same. It's a much needed change too. Just take a look. </p>
<p> This is what I like to see in an Android monetization model: options. The BitTorrent company released a full-function version of µTorrent (AKA uTorrent or MicroTorrent) a little more than a year ago. The beta app was free, but now there's a paid version that drops the beta tag in favor of a "Pro" label. The new app is $2.99 and includes all of the improvements made to the original app, with a little extra. </p>
<p> The description says that the Pro version of µTorrent is ad-free. I don't doubt that, but I also don't see any advertising in the free beta app. </p>
<p> Up to now, there's been no shortage of rudimentary BitTorrent apps for Android, both in the areas of actual download clients (usually pretty poor stuff) and remote managers for desktop torrent programs. But now, downloaders have access to one of the most popular and celebrated torrent clients out there: µTorrent, often called uTorrent or MicroTorrent. The officially blessed BitTorrent client is now available as a beta Android app, downloadable to any Android device running Eclair or later. </p>
<p> The µTorrent Beta seems to be an updated version of BitTorrent Beta, the official BitTorrent company's app. Both apps (along with the remote managers for their desktop programs) are available on Google Play now. </p>
<p> BitTorrent users now have another useful tool at their disposal with the introduction of an official BitTorrent remote client to the Android Market. BitTorrent Inc. (which also owns uTorrent), recently released BitTorrent Remote, an app that allows users to monitor, manage, and control torrent downloads on the go from their mobile devices. </p>
<p> Besides enabling control over torrent downloads, BitTorrent Remote also allows users to get a detailed readout of information related to each download, including speed, file size, seeds, and ETA. The client also allows the user to begin downloads by simply downloading them on a mobile browser, or clicking torrent links within webpages. </p>
<p> uTorrent, one of the most popular BitTorrent clients in existence, has released a new alpha build that brings an awesome new functionality. Users can now drag and drop downloaded content to various devices (including Android phones and tablets) directly from the uTorrent interface. </p>
<p> uTorrent also plans to add video and audio file conversion support in a later, paid version of their software, uTorrent Plus. These features are not new, however. Vuze, a competing BitTorrent client, added device integration and file conversion long ago and has seen great success. </p>
<p> It would appear that the development team at uTorrent is looking to follow that successful model, while still gaining revenue from it. </p>
<p> Before anyone jumps on me, I know there's a number of remote torrent management applications out there on the Market, including ones that work with uTorrent. This app, however, is being put out by none other than BitTorrent Inc., the owners of uTorrent. That means you can expect a remote torrent client that actually works, as opposed to the aforementioned mediocre alternatives. Not to mention the fact that uTorrent Remote packs a feature set other remote torrent apps simply can't match. </p>
<p> What a suspiciously legitimate download queue. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, there's a catch. You need to be using the 3.0 Alpha build of uTorrent on your PC (get it here) in order for this app to work, which is currently only available for Windows. </p>

<p> utter </p>
<p> Utter! isn't the quiet kid in the back of class who only answers a question when asked, pointing out the answer in a textbook like Google Now, nor is it the class clown who dishes out snarky answers whenever he or she doesn't like the way a teacher asks a question, like Siri. Utter! is the student that sits in the front seat and always raises their hand first, the one that has the answer for every question, no matter how it's phrased or what it's about. </p>
<p> Did you know that, since the last update to Google Search, developers have been able to utilize offline voice recognition? Previously, any non-system app that wasn't an IME (Input Method Editor) that hoped to recognize your voice without a web connection needed a rather kludgy typing overlay. Since the update though, apps can hear and interpret not just your words, but essentially any command that doesn't explicitly require web access. </p>
<p> Way back in February, a man by the name of Ben Randall demoed an amazing voice control app called "utter!" that he had started developing. The initial video (a whopping 22 minutes long) demonstrated some amazing capabilities - take a look for yourself: </p>
<p> But that was over 9 months ago, and aside from the initial release of the (very limited) alpha, we haven't heard much about the app, though Mr. Randall has kept interested parties updated via his very active XDA thread. </p>
<p> Want a add a calendar appointment? Tell Utter, and it'll take care of it. Get travel details, find out the weather, and launch applications - all child's play for Utter, and all done using native applications instead of just simple searches. </p>
<p> We know, we know - you're tired of hearing about Siri and its respective knockoffs. But, we assure you, this one is different. Very different. In fact, it's beyond anything we've ever seen before. </p>
<p> The app is called Utter! and while it isn't yet available for download, it's already doing things that we could previously only imagine. Instead of just giving you a generic answer such as Siri and the like, it actually utilizes the apps that you already have installed. </p>

<p> Yesterday's update UVLH1 for the Galaxy S II on T-Mobile may have shaken things up a bit when it comes to NFC and ISIS, but it now looks like Samsung has also sneaked in a tweak dumbing down universal search. A similar "fix" was discovered in T-Mobile's version of the Galaxy S III 2 weeks ago, and it seems like Samsung is not taking any chances with its older sibling either. </p>
<p> A rather innocuous OTA update (T989UVLH1) for T-Mobile's Galaxy S II was announced today, with a 2-line changelog that, on the surface, probably won't excite anyone: </p>
<p> Improvements </p>
<p> ISIS/NFC update </p>
<p> Bug fixes </p>
<p> That's the whole thing. But that little Isis mention is easy to overlook - this is the first phone to officially indicate (if indirectly) support for the carrier-backed mobile payment system. Unfortunately, we don't have a T-Mobile Galaxy S II in order to check if this update actually brings the Isis app itself, or is merely in preparation for support. </p>

<p> 2020 has been hard enough with all the political, economic, and public health crises we've had to deal with. It turns out, 2020 was also supposed to be The Year Of 5G, at least as far as our wireless carriers are concerned. We've talked about the 5G tax we're paying to get the latest mobile chipsets, but if you're on Verizon, you could be getting screwed in an even worse, and arguably much stupider way by the next generation of wireless networks. Verizon is still all-in with an expensive technology called millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G, and not all phones support it. </p>
<p> Update: They've posted in our comments and tweeted about this post! Turns out they've already released an iOS version as well, they're just waiting on Apple to approve their app. </p>
<p> This is one hell of a brilliant idea that deserves all the attention it can get: seven University of Waterloo students have come together to write an app every day for seven straight days. But these aren't just average run-of-the-mill students; they're the cream of the crop, and most have a bevy of industry experience backing them up. Better still, they've worked together before - but their awesomeness was always cut short by the start of a new work/school week. </p>

<p> UX </p>
<p> Google's Play Music & TV service has been long overdue for an update and revamp, especially on Android TV. The app has stagnated behind its counterparts, like the Play Store and YouTube, which got an interface uplift on Android TV in the past months, but it should be getting an overhaul according to new leaked screenshots. </p>
<p> Last month we reported the Play Store was about to get a design overhaul, including a new navigation bar that moved to the bottom of the screen. Although this could only be activated by fiddling with feature flags when we published our initial post, Google is now widely rolling out the new interface to users. </p>
<p> Google has been busy refreshing the Material Design in its apps recently, and the Play Store seems to be among the next ones to get the treatment. Both 9to5Google and one of our tipsters has uncovered the new interface in the latest build by activating a feature flag, which hints the software is about to get a makeover. </p>
<p> Connected security cameras from Arlo are some of the best on the market — Ryan called the Pro 2 the best wireless camera in his review, despite a couple of drawbacks. With Cyber Monday deals you can still get some substantial discounts on Arlo products (like at Amazon and Costco), and thanks to a tweet from the company's CEO, there will soon be even more features to make it worth your while. </p>
<p> Gesture navigation is considered by some to be an important innovation in smartphone UX, not least because it removes the nav bar and allows for more content on the display. It's not easy to get it right, but Apple has done a pretty good job of it and Android OEMs like OnePlus have also had a good go (let's not waste our time discussing Google's Pixel abomination). Samsung's recently announced Galaxy A7 offers another new take on gesture nav, and it actually seems pretty good. </p>
<p> I've been noticing it pretty much since I arrived in Germany for IFA 2018, and now we've had a few tips from readers to confirm it. Google's desktop search UI is being updated to more closely follow the latest evolution of the company's Material Design guidelines — this means rounded corners everywhere, more white than a snowstorm, and a persistent search bar. </p>
<p> Google Chrome's Canary build offers "bleeding edge" features so they can be tested ahead of possible graduation to the more stable versions of the app. Recently, Google has been experimenting with the traditional top-positioned toolbar in response to ever taller Android handsets, first by moving the whole thing to the bottom (Chrome Home), and then by replacing that with a swiping up gesture to access the new tab page (Chrome Duplex). </p>
<p> The latest evolution of this test — controlled by the #enable-chrome-duplex flag in chrome://flags — introduces a brand new bottom toolbar that exactly mirrors the options at the top of the screen. </p>
<p> As Google prepares to sunset Play Music in favor of a new subscription model for YouTube Music, some changes to the app are being made to bring it in line with its competitors. A new fullscreen player UI is rolling out, along with a queue feature similar to Play Music that lets you line up subsequent songs and change the order at will. </p>
<p> Google isn't one to rest on its laurels when it comes to the UX of its apps and sites. The company is continually testing different looks as it tries to keep up with the ever-changing design landscape and make its products as easy to use as possible. Search is still the company's bread and butter, and accordingly, it gets A/B tested more than most other properties. These latest changes have been tested to varying extents in recent months, and from the numerous tips we've had it seems they're being rolled out more-widely now. Let's take a look at what's new. </p>

<p> There are many countries around the world where you can register for a Google Play developer account but not a merchant account, meaning you can create as many apps as you want and distribute them, as long as you want them to be free. Four of these countries are getting proper merchant account registration support: Cambodia, Kenya, Uzbekistan, and Zambia. </p>
<p> The debate between physical and digital books is a heated one. Some people prefer the look of a tome on their bookshelf and enjoy the smell of each page as they hold their nose to an old favorite. Others like the convenience that comes with having access to an entire personal library of books whenever and wherever they have their phone. One clear disadvantage of digital books, though, is the ability for a single company to determine when and where you can buy them. </p>
<p> After years of waiting, folks in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan can now purchase books from the Play Store. </p>

<p> Hey, guess what? After about 18 hours as a Release Candidate, Chameleon Launcher for Android tablets is now available in its full v1.0 glory. That's right, it's no longer beta. </p>
<p> It has been a twisty, turny, windy, and other non-straight words journey for Chameleon, so it's nice to see the launcher hit its first full release. According to the Chameleon Blog, there are still a few kinks to be worked out (which makes me question the "final" release status), but hopefully that'll happen relatively quickly. </p>
<p> Total Commander, my favorite go-to app for powerful dual-pane file management on both Windows and Android (see our overview for features and screenshots), reached v1.0 final today, dropping the incredibly annoying mandatory expiration which was present in the release candidates. One such expiration caught me on a plane with no Internet access and forced me to literally turn back time on my tablet just to get it to work again. </p>

<p> v1.7 </p>
<p> MX has always been a pretty impressive video player - it's chocked full of useful features and offers nearly every codec imaginable. Today, it received an update to v1.7 that brings a fair amount of performance improvements for various devices, as well as one really neat key feature: background playback. </p>
<p> Changelog: </p>
<p> Stabilized S/W decoder on Tegra 3 devices such as ASUS Transformer Prime, HTC One X, Nexus 7. </p>
<p> Pandora for Android received a big update this morning, which brought a brand new UI to the app, in addition to a host of other new features. </p>
<p> Users of the app can now browse their song history if they want to find a track that they liked in the past, and those tracks can be reviewed, rated, or bookmarked whilst browsing. </p>
<p> If you love a particular track, you can now dive into the information associated with it to find a full bio of the artist, as well as tracks and artists similar to the song that you're currently listening to. </p>

<p> v2 </p>
<p> Vine was the internet phenomenon that proved that short, easily digestible video clips could be tremendously popular and spark creativity. However, the rigid six-second format had soon been adopted and loosened up by Instagram and later TikTok, and after Twitter purchased Vine, it vanished into obscurity. An unceremonious death followed in 2016. But Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann still believes in the format and has been working on a successor for a long time. After an extensive beta phase, this new product, Byte, is now official and stable on the Play Store. </p>
<p> To be perfectly honest, I'm not much of an e-mag guy. I tried Google Currents for a while, but never quite saw the utility of it, and so quickly transitioned back to my beloved Feedly and Google Reader. That's not to say I haven't realized the limitations of RSS many times, though, especially as certain websites I follow look to integrate more multimedia into articles. (Having to use Chrome to listen to audio or video in a weird custom player is really frustrating.) And concededly, apps like Currents look a thousand times better than feeds, which are traditionally text-heavy. </p>
<p> A major update to Flipboard, released today to Google Play, may just get me to reconsider magazine-style news apps. </p>
<p> Allow me to be blunt for a moment: AOL's Moviefone was in desperate need of a makeover. Sure, back in the day the styling was appropriate – but now we want Holo. Everywhere. </p>
<p> Good news: the most recent update to Moviefone ditches the old tabbed-style interface for a much nicer-looking Holo-esque interface and dark color scheme. It really is quite nice looking – especially in comparison to the former version: </p>
<p> Google Authenticator, an important security tool that enables 2-step verification for your Google account, has racked up over 250,000 downloads over its lifetime, which is no small feat for any app in the Play Store. However, a few days ago, that version (previously available here) all of a sudden became obsolete and was consequently silently deleted. </p>
<p> Its replacement, which can be found here, bears version 2 (2.15 to be exact) and offers the following changelog: </p>
<p> New entry for Google Play, same great app </p>
<p> Updated look and feel </p>
<p> "Scan barcode" and "Manually add account" options moved to Menu > Add account. </p>
<p> Skype, one of the most popular audio/video calling applications on the desktop and now property of Microsoft, has been long criticized for lacking any video support on Android and being generally unstable and prone to crashing. In an effort to rectify the situation and raise that 3.6-star Market average, the company released a major version update minutes ago from 1.0.0.983 to 2.0.0.45. </p>
<p> The update finally brings video calling, albeit to only a small subset of devices: </p>
<p> Google Nexus S </p>
<p> HTC Desire S </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson Xperia neo </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson Xperia pro </p>
<p> Update 7/1/11: The Nexus S 4G and the European Nexus S were added to the list of supported devices after a small 2.0.0.47 update today. </p>
<p> As far as Android translation apps go, Google Translate is still among the best available - sure, it isn't perfect, but it's free and for the occasional translation it'll suffice. To celebrate the app's first birthday, Google has updated it to 2.0 and added a new feature called "Conversation Mode." </p>
<p> Conversation Mode allows you and your foreign friend to speak in two different languages before having Google Translate display the words you say onscreen in your native languages (as seen in the second screenshot above). For now, it only works with Spanish and English, and it has problems with regional accents, background noise, and rapid speech, but it's a start. </p>

<p> v3 </p>
<p> If you're eagerly awaiting your chance to order a Moto Razr come January, then there's no amount of teasing that will neither discourage you nor help you pass the time. But there are a few factoids about this flip phone with a folding display you may not have caught right at the announcement, so we thought you should get to know some of them. </p>
<p> On Tuesday night, surprisingly ahead of the usual update-all-the-things-Wednesday, Google released a major revision of the Play Books app for Android, updating it from v2 (2.9.21) to v3 (3.0.15). The changelog, which was shockingly present from the get-go (thank you!), confused me a bit but after digging around, I finally figured out what it means. Oh, and I found another fix that wasn't mentioned. </p>
<p> What's New? </p>
<p> The official changelog is as follows: </p>
<p> Added the ability to search the text of original-pages books. </p>
<p> Added a "see all" shortcut from Read Now to My Library. </p>
<p> The Redbox movie and video game rental kiosks that seem to be at every McDonald's, Walgreens, Walmart, and umpteen other locations across the country are easily one of the most convenient ways to get your entertainment fix. If Redboxes in your town are anything like they are in mine, however, there's always a line of people. Instead of standing around waiting for you chance to grab The Cabin in the Woods, though, you could fire up the recently updated Android App. It's much, much better and far more useful than it used to be. </p>
<p> If you used previous versions of the app, you probably know that it was borderline useless; even simple sorting options were absent! </p>
<p> Let's face it: productivity suites like Microsoft Office or the cloud-based Google Docs aren't exactly exciting, but they are among the most vital applications for the businessmen in us. Whether this remains true when 2.8-4.3-inch displays are concerned is debatable, but if you ask DataViz, the company that developed the free Documents To Go app, the answer is a resounding "yes." </p>
<p> The company has just released a brand new version 3.0 of its uber-popular app, which includes numerous improvements, namely: </p>
<p> a "totally redesigned" UI (not so sure that's for the better, though; all I'm seeing right now is a bunch of ugly blue menus) </p>
<p> an enhanced file browser </p>
<p> Google Docs support (the one thing that had always been missing for me) </p>
<p> an improved PDF viewer that now includes various zooming options (pinch-to-zoom and double-tap-to-zoom), keypad shortcuts, hyperlinks, the ability to rotate a page, render multiple pages, and more </p>
<p> an "optimized" version of Slideshow To Go </p>
<p> support for password-protected Office 2003 & 2007 docs as well as support for Microsoft Office 2010 files </p>
<p> The free version of the app doesn't allow you to edit or create files but can be used for reading them. </p>

<p> v30 </p>
<p> Although there have now been three successors to the LG V30 — V30S, V35, and V40 — the phone has only been out for a bit over a year. Thus, it's pretty surprising that an AT&T unlocked version can now be had for $249.99 new, which is a lot more appealing than its $799.99 MSRP. </p>
<p> Thanks to its ARCore SDK, Google made developing augmented reality applications more accessible and streamlined. To guarantee a consistent experience across devices, the Californian giant has put a certification process in place, through which it ensures the camera, motion sensors, and CPU perform as expected. Among the list of officially supported handsets are the LG G7, V30, V35, and V40 series, which offer the same motion tracking as other certified products. Nevertheless, Google acknowledged autofocus is not correctly working on these phones for the time being, although that shouldn't alter the end user's experience. </p>
<p> Most of you are probably familiar with AT&T's very misleading initiative to dub an enhanced version of 4G LTE "5G Evolution." As the top comment on that post predicted, the "5G E" icon has begun to roll out very quickly, already hitting both the LG V30 and Samsung Galaxy S8 active less than two weeks after the announcement. </p>
<p> The V30 may be over a year old at this point, but the Verizon version was updated just yesterday with a handful of new features, including some camera functionality tweaks and additional always-on display modes inherited from the newer G7. The security patch level has also been bumped up to November 2018. </p>
<p> LG's latest phones themselves haven't been horrible, but the bang for the buck they've been offering hasn't been great. The V30+, an upgraded V30 with more storage and earphones included, was released back in late 2017 at an MSRP of a whopping $929.99. This latest Amazon deal brings the price down to a much more reasonable $399.99, though it's only available for around 10.5 more hours as of publishing time. </p>
<p> Some smartphone manufacturers have their own bootloader unlock tools, and LG is one of them. It made its debut back in 2015 with the H815 G4, but it's since added plenty more phones to the roster. Two of the latest phones to join are the G7 and V30, though only the European models are currently supported. </p>
<p> T-Mobile has resumed its rollout of Android 8.0 Oreo for the LG V30 and V30+ almost three weeks after it was halted. You'll need to be running the latest version of the McAfee Security for T-Mobile app (version 4.9) to get your hands on it. </p>
<p> LG announced a new version of the V30 at Mobile World Congress this year called the V30S ThinQ. At the time, it wouldn't commit to launching the phone in the US. Now, pre-orders for the North American V30S ThinQ are live, and the price tag is bordering on insulting. The B&H product page lists this phone at $929.99. Yikes. </p>
<p> At Mobile World Congress, LG announced a new version of the V30 called the V30S ThinQ, but it wasn't actually new. There were no hardware changes to enable the AI camera features (just more storage and RAM), so there was nothing stopping LG from rolling them out in an update. It did so in Korea last month, and now the same re-branding is coming to Verizon in the latest update. </p>

<p> v30 review </p>
<p> For years, LG's smartphones have always seemed to trail Samsung's in some crucial ways. Being direct rivals hailing from the same country, this must rub LG the wrong way. Samsung's OLED displays have always bested LG's IPS LCDs. Its cameras have generally been well ahead in terms of quality and features. Samsung was waterproofing its phones before LG was. Samsung Pay beat LG Pay. Samsung's Gear smartwatches have received far more critical acclaim than LG's Android Wear ones. </p>
<p> And when LG has been able to get features to market before Samsung - curved displays and wireless charging, for example - Samsung has become known for them, while LG gets little credit. </p>
<p> I'll cut to the chase: if your primary concern with the LG G6 was that it simply didn't seem like a proper flagship phone, I can safely assure you that the new V30 is. Its 6" QHD+ OLED display finally brings LG smartphones into the OLED era, though I do have my concerns with this screen even having only used the phone for under a day. The Snapdragon 835 processor is the best chipset Qualcomm has on offer, so that's an easy sell, and LG's included its Quad DAC in all models of the V30 for maximum audiophile authority (I, for one, am pleased the V30 has a headphone jack at all). </p>

Now, pre-orders for the North American V30S ThinQ are live, and the price tag is bordering on insulting. The B&H product page lists this phone at $929.99. Yikes. </p>
<p> LG rolled the V30 out late last year with a few notable features, at least for LG. That phone had the first OLED panel on an LG phone in several years, and it didn't have the extra ticker display that defined older V-series phones. It turns out LG isn't done with the V30 yet. As rumors indicated, LG is releasing a new version of the V30 called the V30S ThinQ (yes, that's the name) with AI camera goodies. With a new name and features, you might expect this phone to be at least modestly different than the last V30. Well, ThinQ again. </p>

<p> LG's V-series lineup has become quite convoluted in recent years, with the V30, V30S, V35, V40, and V50 all having been released in the span of 1.5 years. The AT&T V40 received its Pie update about a week ago, and it's now the slightly older V35's turn. </p>
<p> This past week was all about the Pixel 3, and if you're anything like us, right now you're looking to save money any which way you can in order to get your pre-order in for one of Google's latest handsets. Of course, just because you're putting together your Pixel 3 fund doesn't mean you can't drop a little cash elsewhere, and we've spotted a few deals that will hook you up with some desirable tech while also leaving you with money to spare. </p>
<p> LG phones probably haven't been getting much love on Project Fi, especially with the introductions of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, so the Google MVNO has decided to spice things up a bit. Both LG flagships are now being offered for $200 off, bringing the G7 down to $549 and the V35 to $699, with $150 free Fi service credit to sweeten the deal. This beats last month's deal out by $50. </p>
<p> Samsung is known for having the best displays in the smartphone/tablet game, and that hasn't changed with the new Galaxy Note9 and Tab S4. As a result, we're not surprised that Netflix has already added the duo to its HD/HDR support list. Several other devices have been added as well. </p>
<p> LG has a treat for its most devoted Korean fans: a special edition V35 ThinQ that costs a totally reasonable $1,800 (or 1,999,800 won). That premium gets buyers a ceramic back, a nice pair of Bluetooth headphones, and exclusivity — there will only be 300 of the device made. </p>
<p> Google's Project Fi service has always offered compelling pricing, but the phone selection was severely limited. It recently announced a handful of new devices, and two of them start shipping today. The LG G7 ThinQ and V35 ThinQ can be yours on Fi, but get ready to spend big to get them. </p>

<p> LG had this bad streak last year in trying to spin the V30 ThinQ in as many different variants as possible. One of them was the V35 ThinQ, originally a $900 AT&T exclusive before it eventually hopped over to Amazon as a Prime Exclusive. If you, a Prime member, happen to desire a V35 for some reason, Amazon's gotten into some tempting as the phone is on a big discount right now. </p>
<p> More than a year after it was reported that LG would be launching a mobile payment service with compatibility for magnetic stripe terminals in the United States, the company has finally announced the arrival of LG Pay for the LG G8 ThinQ. Though we can say that Samsung Pay finally has a one-to-one competitor in its space, it will take a good while before spreading out to other devices. </p>

<p> It's OK to admit it — you messed up. You thought we were still in the middle of November or something, and that you had weeks left to do your holiday shopping. Well, after you consult with your neurologist about these concerning lost-time events, you can still scramble to pick up a few last-minute holiday deals, with plenty of offers still available on our favorite mobile tech. </p>

<p> Project Fi may have many fans—after all, it gives you service across three US carriers plus international roaming at an affordable pay-as-you-go rate—but one thing subscribers don't enjoy is the lack of selection when it comes to phones. Fi hears that, and to make up for it, it's adding the Moto G6, LG G7 ThinQ, and LG V35 ThinQ to its lineup. The affordable G6 is even available to pre-order today. </p>

<p> v40 thinq </p>
<p> The LG V40 ThinQ only recently received Android 9 Pie on all US carriers, but it's already time for another minor update, hitting the Verizon variant first. It includes some security patches, a native screen recording app, and a secure power-off feature. </p>
<p> More than a year after it was reported that LG would be launching a mobile payment service with compatibility for magnetic stripe terminals in the United States, the company has finally announced the arrival of LG Pay for the LG G8 ThinQ. Though we can say that Samsung Pay finally has a one-to-one competitor in its space, it will take a good while before spreading out to other devices. </p>
<p> In spite of having less name recognition than competitors like Google, Samsung, and Apple, LG is bold enough to ask $949.99 for its V40 ThinQ. The V40 is the best phone LG's ever made, but as we said in our review, that's not quite enough. Luckily, B&H is slashing $200 off, bringing the price down to a much more palatable $749.99, and it's also throwing in a free 256GB SanDisk microSD card and a second year of warranty. </p>
<p> LG has just taken the wraps off the V40 ThinQ, its follow-up to the almost continual V30/V30S ThinQ/V35 ThinQ refreshes. The latest iteration in the V series brings real change in design, though, with a new notched and significantly improved OLED display, triple rear camera configuration, and a $900-1000 price tag to go with it. </p>
<p> The LG V40 is officially official, and you can get all the specifications you can handle in the handy table below. But we already knew most of that going in, and of what we didn't know, most of that was predictable: the latest and greatest Qualcomm processor, a big, vibrant OLED display, and a whole mess of cameras. Stare at the list of features and value-adds all you want, but it's not going to answer a critical question: has LG built a big phone worthy of taking on Samsung's $1000 behemoth? </p>
<p> And in the US, that really is the only question worth asking. </p>
<p> LG’s latest device is still two days away from its official unveiling, yet it feels like we already know all about it. Leaks started way back in June and since then, we’ve had renders and even an official LG press release and teaser video. The most intriguing aspect of the V40 ThinQ is its camera setup – two lenses on the front and three on the back. </p>
<p> LG stuck with the V30 longer than we expected, re-releasing the phone twice more after the original version shipped in late 2017. Now, it seems poised to move on with the V40 ThinQ, a device with more cameras than you'll know what to do with. A leaked render of the phone shows off three sensors on the back, and a pair up front housed in a notch. </p>

<p> Back in December, LG began to roll out the official version of Android 10 to South Korean-based G8 ThinQ phones following a brief beta program. During this time, LG also launched an Android 10 beta for the beefier V50 ThinQ. Now we've learned that the South Korean variant of the V50 has started to receive the stable version of Android 10 as early as last week. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/13 1:39pm PDTon Apr 13, 2020 and last updated 2020/04/25 11:52am PDTon Apr 25, 2020. </p>
<p> LG's got a new design language in the works — a fresh take on its phones that's supposed to usher the company into this decade with a clean look and some updated thinking towards flagship hardware. But before we turn the page to that next chapter, we've still got its first big 2020 launch to check out, the 5G-equipped, Dual Screen, 865-packing LG V60 ThinQ. </p>
<p> LG is having a hard time pushing timely software updates even to its flagship range, despite having a dedicated Software Upgrade Center for this exact purpose. The South Korean brand did begin updating a few of its V- and G-series phones to Android 10 in the last couple of months, but not all these releases have yet to see international availability, and many users remain clueless as to when the update notification might pop up on their LG handsets. To smooth their ruffled feathers, LG Italy recently published its Android 10 update roadmap. </p>
<p> Every smartphone manufacturer wants to get in on the ground floor of the latest trends, and in 2019 the name of the game is “folding.” After teasing flexible technology at trade shows for years, we're finally seeing the arrival of big-screen phones that bend down the middle for easy storage. But other companies are turning to more old-school tech to accomplish a similar feat, like LG and its dual-screen hardware. After getting started with the V50, LG's back with its follow-up: the G8X with Dual Screen case. </p>
<p> Enhanced gaming has been one of the most consistently promoted features of LG phones that support its Dual Screen hardware. Until now, the only gaming-centric improvement available for these devices has been the ability to use the second display as a dedicated gamepad. Now we're finally seeing games introduce some bespoke functionality for that second panel, with the release of a dual-screen edition of Pirates of the Caribbean: Tides of War. </p>
<p> Every few weeks, Google updates its ARCore support list with new devices. This time around, Google's added the two new LG flagship phones — the G8 and the V50 — as well as four iPad models and the iPhone XR. </p>
<p> Verizon's Galaxy S10 5G is officially launching today, making it the first carrier to market with a 5G phone in the US. Sprint isn't far behind with its LG V50 5G, today announcing that it would be available for pre-order tomorrow. Plus, for a limited time, Sprint is slashing 50% off its lease price. </p>
<p> The LG V50 debuted alongside the G8 at MWC back in February. The G8 is now out (check our our review here), though the same can't be said for the V50. Nonetheless, LG has chosen to release the kernel source code for the V50 now. </p>
<p> LG's last few V-series phones have been pretty similar to each other, but it looks like the upcoming V50 is going to have something special up its sleeve: 5G. A leaked photo of the Sprint V50 from Evan Blass reveals that the phone will have 5G capabilities, and given the giant yellow logo on the back, it isn't shy about it. </p>

<p> v50 thinq </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/02/12 12:08pm PSTon Feb 12, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/19 11:49am PDTon May 19, 2020. </p>
<p> Back in December, LG began to roll out the official version of Android 10 to South Korean-based G8 ThinQ phones following a brief beta program. During this time, LG also launched an Android 10 beta for the beefier V50 ThinQ. Now we've learned that the South Korean variant of the V50 has started to receive the stable version of Android 10 as early as last week. </p>
<p> If you're a long-suffering LG smartphone owner who just wished that the company would just take a little bit more care of its software... let's just say we've resigned to a level of masochism. Updates are slow to come out and the UI itself contains plenty of outdated motifs. But worse news may be to come as some purported screenshots of the upcoming LG UX 9.1 on top of Android 10 have been uploaded to a South Korean forum. </p>
<p> LG seems really invested in making Dual Screen cases for its phones, expanding the amount of real estate available to smartphone users while bypassing the engineering requirements of a folding phone. There's one for the V50 and one for the sorta all-new G8X that just debuted at IFA 2019. But there's one detail that about that Dual Screen case for the G8X that seems particularly fishy and quite ugly. </p>

<p> V50 ThinQ 5G </p>
<p> More than a year after it was reported that LG would be launching a mobile payment service with compatibility for magnetic stripe terminals in the United States, the company has finally announced the arrival of LG Pay for the LG G8 ThinQ. Though we can say that Samsung Pay finally has a one-to-one competitor in its space, it will take a good while before spreading out to other devices. </p>
<p> The LG V50 ThinQ 5G has endured a stop-and-go release schedule. In the midst of growing pains with South Korea's next-gen cellular grid, the company pushed its original home market launch date of April 19 by nearly a month. Sprint, the U.S. carrier that claimed the early lead on the device, started sales on May 31. We knew that Verizon would also take up the V50 this "summer," but it wasn't until now that we learned it would be this week — on the last day of spring. </p>

<p> V60 </p>
<p> Google has gotten a bit stricter with requiring OEMs to add Android's security updates over the years, but that doesn't mean companies are actually on board. LG's Software Update Center may be running at full power, but everything from last-minute bugs to carrier certification can hold up Android updates. It's almost July, but LG's new dual-screen capable device is only now receiving the May security patch. </p>
<p> It costs much to own a smartphone with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 inside — some would say too much — and it doesn't look as if prices will tide off soon. But if you're hungry for a spec upgrade and are willing to jump hoops for it, you can get an LG V60 with complimentary Dual Screen case for $550 if you start a new line on Verizon and as low as free if you trade in a phone. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/13 1:39pm PDTon Apr 13, 2020 and last updated 2020/04/25 11:52am PDTon Apr 25, 2020. </p>
<p> LG's got a new design language in the works — a fresh take on its phones that's supposed to usher the company into this decade with a clean look and some updated thinking towards flagship hardware. But before we turn the page to that next chapter, we've still got its first big 2020 launch to check out, the 5G-equipped, Dual Screen, 865-packing LG V60 ThinQ. </p>
<p> Not all phones with a stylus are created equal: Samsung's Galaxy Note series support active pens; the recently-launched Moto G Stylus does not. A part of that function is due to their price gap, but you wouldn't think that phones that don't come with complimentary styluses would also have digitized displays. Well, the LG V60 comes with not one, but two small surprises in that aspect. </p>
<p> LG's latest stab at making dual-screen smartphones a thing is the V60 ThinQ 5G, and you'll be able to pick on up starting this week. Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile have all announced preliminary launch details. T-Mobile and AT&T will be first out of the gate with Verizon bringing up the rear next week. </p>
<p> For the past few years, LG has introduced its mainstream G-series flagship in late winter or early spring, followed by a larger, more creator-focused V-series phone a few months later. We saw that routine begin to get shaken up last fall with the launch of the G8X (complete with its Dual Screen accessory hoping to steal a little thunder from the folding-phone craze), and now that shift continues not with the introduction of a presumptive G9, but instead with an early new entry to the V series, the LG V60 ThinQ 5G. </p>
<p> A month ahead of the event, LG has just pushed out a teaser video, telling folks to "save the date" on Friday, September 6th during IFA. In the video, LG shows off what looks like a folding, dual-screen device, though it's probably another dual-screen case for an upcoming phone, similar to the one made for the V50 ThinQ 5G. Given the timing and the dual-screen connection, LG is probably going to show off the V60 (ThinQ?) </p>

<p> vacation </p>
<p> Work-life balance can be tricky. Google Calendar is getting a couple of additions that will hopefully make it easier to delineate when your work time ends and your personal time begins: soon, G Suite users will be able to set both their normal work hours as well as mark when they're out of the office. </p>
<p> In its quest to make our lives easier, Google has recently taken on the travel industry by giving us search tools for flights and hotels, as well as an app to help us plan and organize trips we've already booked. Google Search already shows when a slight adjustment to travel dates can save us money, but now it's adding more robust tools for people whose travel dates are more flexible. </p>
<p> Inbox has been growing consistently more feature-rich with a mix of new features designed just for its efficient interface and old features that are slowly integrated from its forefather Gmail. There aren't any obvious signs of new features to play with in this version, but there is something for the teardown archives. With the release of v1.27, evidence shows another classic feature will soon make the jump from Gmail to Inbox: the vacation responder. </p>
<p> Groupon is a good resource to turn to for people who love to buy or experience new things but hate paying full price. The service offers discounts on everything ranging from refurbished electronics to entrees for two at the local bar. It also does vacations, and now Groupon has released a separate Android app that's dedicated entirely to getting away. </p>
<p> Sporting a fresh and modern interface, Getaways by Groupon can help users snag affordable trips to far off places. It will toss up discounts for tourist destinations all over the world, with some packages also including travel. The app can display how money is being saved, how many people have purchased the package, and how much time remains until the deal ends. </p>
<p> An update to Gmail started rolling out this morning, bringing it from version 4.6.1 to 4.7. We have the APK for you below, as usual, because waiting is for suckers. </p>
<p> What's New </p>
<p> Vacation responder </p>
<p> The most obvious new addition to Gmail 4.7 is the Vacation Responder. You can set start and end dates, enter a subject and some text, and check a toggle to only send the vacation response to your contacts. Finally, you can enable and disable the whole responder with another toggle. The vacation responder is certainly a welcome addition to the mobile app, considering that by the time you realize you need the feature enabled, you may only have your trusty phone or tablet but no computer. </p>

<p> vacation planning </p>
<p> Two years ago, I had to plan a vacation trip to London and all I remember was spending countless hours online checking airline ticket prices, hotel prices, and switching back and forth between different dates to see which combination resulted in the most affordable trip for me. That's not to mention the days of extensive research into London's theatre scene, events, restaurants, tourist attractions, and more, to find the places I knew I'd enjoy most. If I was to plan that same trip now, I'd have a much better way of doing it through Google's new Destinations. </p>
<p> Google is integrating its almighty knowledge of places with its Google Flight, Hotel search, weather history, itineraries, and more to become the travel agent you always wanted to have and that you can always pester for questions and new details. </p>

<p> vacuum </p>
<p> Nobody likes vacuuming, but everybody thinks robots are cool — especially robots that help clean up around the house. For today's deal, Amazon is offering up Roborock robotic vacuums for up to 44% off, including models that even perform mopping duties. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/10/13 8:00am PDTon Oct 13, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/14 12:00pm PDTon Oct 14, 2020. </p>
<p> Roborock, the Beijing-based company known for making some of the smartest robotic vacuums on the market, has just announced some pretty big Prime Day discounts on the S6 MaxV, S5 Max, S6, and E3. Keep in mind that each of these offers take place on specific days and times, so you’ll need to be vigilant if you want to sweep up the right vacuum for you. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/10/09 8:00am PDTon Oct 9, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/11 9:04am PDTon Oct 11, 2020. </p>
<p> While most of Roborock’s robotic vacuums are adept at both sweeping carpets and mopping hard-surface floors, the team at Roborock understands that not every user needs that mopping element. The S4 Max is designed specifically for users who simply need an intelligent vacuum. By focusing exclusively on sweeping, the S4 Max is able to provide Roborock’s premium cleaning tech at an even greater value. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/10/05 8:00am PDTon Oct 5, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/10 9:01am PDTon Oct 10, 2020. </p>
<p> After being delayed earlier this year due to COVID-19, Amazon’s Prime Day is finally right around the corner. While our friends at Roborock won’t be able to help you sweep up all the savings that are about to come your way, they do have an exciting deal of their own. Right now, you can pick up a Roborock S5 Max for only $439 ($110 off) at Amazon. </p>
<p> As our phones continue gaining new AI-powered features like Google Duplex and kiss detection, it was only a matter of time before our vacuums followed suit. The company behind Roomba, iRobot, is introducing its new Roomba i3+ today, and it's a vacuum that can "evolve and get smarter over time." That's cool, but — excuse me while I go barricade my door in preparation for the robotic vacuum uprising. </p>

<p> Every time you step through your front door, you inadvertently invite dirt, mud, and other irritants into your home that could prevent your hardwood and tile floors from looking their best. Luckily, Roborock makes it easy to clean these surfaces without lifting a finger. The intelligent Roborock S5 Max robotic vacuum and mop is available right now for $549 ($50 off) at Walmart. </p>

<p> Unlike typical robotic vacuums that use sensors to compile vague maps of your home layout, the new Roborock S6 MaxV employs dual cameras to “see,” detect, and even maneuver around obstacles on your floor. That means instead of driving through presents left by your pet, the S6 MaxV actively avoids obstructions that could create an even bigger mess. In this early bird sale, the self-navigating S6 MaxV by Roborock can be yours for $699.99 ($50 off) at Amazon. </p>

<p> Having already established itself as a major contender in robotic vacuum cleaners, Roborock’s first cordless handheld model continues the company’s legacy by delivering power and efficiency in an elegantly designed package. This week, you can win one of two brand new Roborock H6 cordless vacuums, plus save $50 when you purchase an H6 using our exclusive discount code. Here’s everything you need to know. </p>
<p> Google's Nest Hubs and third-party Assistant Smart Displays have been receiving an update that vastly improves their smart home controls. Among the changes we spotted are live light status and scenes for Philips Hue and Lifx, new Shield controls, the ability to unlock your smart lock, plus controls for blinds, air fresheners, and vacuums. Other product categories may be updated too, but we don't have everything on hand to test with. </p>

<p> What do you do when you already build some of the smartest, most capable robotic vacuums on the planet? You take that award-winning design and expand upon it.

<p> As you've sat indoors throughout the COVID-19 quarantine, you've probably taken note of all the cleaning that needs to be done in your home: dust the banisters, sweep the floors, scrub down the kitchen, and the list goes on. Wouldn't it be nice if you could automatically cross off one of these chores? Never manually vacuum your home again with the new Roborock E4 robotic vacuum, on sale right now for just $242.99 ($57 off). </p>

<p> Parenting was already tough, but it's harder now than ever before thanks to Coronavirus. Parents with kids at home now have to juggle homeschooling their children with work and every challenge that's thrown their way. The last thing they have time to do is vacuum the house. Luckily, it's easier than ever to automate floor cleaning chores with the new Roborock E4, the ideal robotic vacuum for busy families everywhere. </p>

<p> Technology has revolutionized so many different aspects of daily life, from banking, to business, and even cleaning your house. If you're still vacuuming with a heavy, cord-laden monstrosity from the aughts, your home may not be as clean as you think. Your home deserves a premium smart vacuum with the intelligence and power to leave no dirt behind — what it needs is Roborock. </p>
<p> Last summer, my wife and I got married and we moved from Portugal to Boston almost immediately after our honeymoon. It's great to have a place just for ourselves, but we quickly found that neither of us were big fans of having to vacuum our apartment. It's a laborious and monotonous job that takes up a lot of time, but it's also an unavoidable fact of life that homes get dirty and need to be cleaned regularly. Not wanting to spend an hour or more every week vacuuming up the place, we checked out The Wirecutter's robot vacuum recommendations and ordered their pick, the Ecovacs Deebot N79, half expecting we'd return it within a couple of weeks. </p>
<p> You know what's better than a robot that looks like a thick frisbee and slides around your house? It's the one that cleans where it walks without hitting walls and furniture on its way, so that you can come home to less dirty floors as if a magical fairy passed by and did her deed. But what if you can have an even better version? Yes, better, because not only it's a robot, it's also WiFi-connected to an app on your smartphone, so you can control it from afar. That's the new iRobot Roomba 980. </p>
<p> iRobot knows its vacuums. This isn't the first Roomba it releases, so it has been learning from past products, improving and perfecting them. </p>

<p> vainglory </p>
<p> Vainglory is without a doubt the most popular MOBA on Android. Sure there are some recent up and comers, but Vainglory still remains the go-to MOBA on mobile. Now, despite the fact that it has earned its current popularity, one of its players' major complaints was that it only allowed for 3v3 gameplay. This all changes today as you can now play 5v5 matches with full 3-lane maps any time you like, just like the big boys on PC. </p>
<p> The Vulkan graphics API is a big deal for mobile developers, since its direct GPU access allows for complex graphics to be rendered with a considerably lower hit to the processor, and thus a lower overhead on the hardware and battery life. A few devices like the SHIELD family and Samsung's 7 series already supported Vulkan several months ago, but Nougat now features full support for all updated Android 7.0 devices. Developer Super Evil Megacorp, which turned heads last year with its Vainglory mobile MOBA, now has a beta version that uses the Vulkan API. </p>
<p> If you're a fan of the super-popular top-down MOBA genre (think Dota, League of Legends, and Heroes of the Storm), you'll want to sit up and take notice of a little game called Vainglory. This mobile interpretation of the well-known formula has been built from the ground up for touchscreens, and the experience has been praised on iOS since its launch back in November. It's available for free today on the Play Store. </p>
<p> Vainglory doesn't make an attempt to hide its inspiration. If you're not familiar with the standard MOBA formula, it's basically a shorter and more action-packed version of a real-time strategy game where each player controls a single unit. </p>

<p> valentine </p>
<p> Google Playground's stickers and Playmojis are pretty fun, and the timely Childish Gambino drop likely brought more attention to the Pixel's AR features. It makes sense, then, that Valentine's Day arrives with another new pack, predictably all pink and heart-shaped. </p>
<p> Valentine's Day is coming up and you still don't know what to get your significant other? Think no more; Google has you covered with bundles and special deals on the Pixel 2, several connected home devices, and accessories. </p>
<p> If you're wishing someone a happy Valentine's day using Hangouts today rather than face-to-face, Google's got a special easter egg for you. </p>
<p> Back in December, Google added tons of special animations to Hangouts, triggered by words like "woohoo" or "yay!!" or "lmao," but it looks like there are some extra treats for Valentine's day. Typing "Happy Valentine's," or "Happy Valentine's day" will trigger a few heart-themed animations, featuring a love-struck emoji or a fox gifting flowers to its duck Valentine. </p>
<p> This easter egg seems to be part of Google's effort to make Valentine's day special for users across its web properties, with other tricks including a heart-filled +1 action on Google+ (seen below) and Google's "special edition" reCAPTCHAs. </p>

<p> valuation </p>
<p> Essential, Andy Rubin's new phone company, was able to raise $300 million in a recent financing round. Investors must have been impressed by Essential and its future projects, such as the PH-1 and Essential Home. The total valuation for the company determined during financing was set somewhere between $900 million and $1 billion. These are all pretty big numbers for a company that hasn't actually made anything yet, but the weight of Andy Rubin at the helm must have been a contributing factor. </p>
<p> The success that the Angry Birds games have brought to Rovio is stunning, really: the company was reportedly on the verge of bankruptcy when it released the game, and today, revenue is estimated to be between $50 and 70 million annually. It's perhaps no surprise, then, that the company raised $42 million in funding earlier this month, and they enjoyed the luxury of picking and choosing their investors. They even reportedly determined the terms of investment - quite the reversal of roles. </p>

<p> value pack </p>
<p> Considered to be one of the better smartwatches available, and my personal favorite, the Samsung Gear S3 received a substantial update today. Dubbed "Value Pack," it brings both the Classic and the Frontier to Tizen 3.0.0.1, as well as a bunch of new stuff. </p>
<p> It's been a rather wild ride for Samsung Galaxy S users regarding a possible update to Android 4.0. First, Samsung, issued a statement saying that they could not update their former flagship phone. After a community outcry, however, they responded with a different possibility - a "Value Pack" update, one that would include some key features from Ice Cream Sandwich (such as Face Unlock) but which would still be based on Gingerbread. Samsung later decided to not go through with the Value Pack update. </p>
<p> The plot has thickened once again, however: a version of the update has been leaked, and while it may not be as good as Ice Cream Sandwich itself, it does bring a host of improvements: </p>
<p> Updated Camera </p>
<p> Photo Editor from Galaxy SII </p>
<p> Unlock screen from Galaxy Note </p>
<p> The firmware, which is based on Android 2.3.6, is available for download from the links below, but it at this time it's unclear if or when Samsung will officially release the final version of the update to the general public. </p>

<p> It would appear that everyone's favorite new MOBA trend is Auto Chess, so of course, Valve has their own version in the works that's built off of Dota. The game is called Dota Underlords, and it just entered into a limited beta where Dota 2 Battle Pass owners can jump in early to test the waters on PC. After a week of stress-testing through Battle Pass, an open beta will begin for everyone else, and this will include Steam (Windows, Mac, and Linux), Android, and iOS users. </p>
<p> Valve announced some big news for Steam users today, introducing the new Steam Link Anywhere service. Building off of its namesake, Anywhere takes streaming your personal library to the next level by allowing you to play on a client device outside of your local network (which was one of the weakest points of Steam Link when it launched for Android). To coincide with the announcement of the Anywhere beta, Valve has updated the Steam Link Android app to support it. </p>
<p> Steam, despite some controversial competition lately, is still the king of PC gaming — the ubiquitous platform sports a massive list of features, even basic ones like a shopping cart. One of the areas where Steam has struggled, however, is the quality of its mobile app. Now, Steam Link is a fine application and I use it almost daily, but the main one is just... rough. One of Steam's most robust features is its communication tools and Chat, one of the core elements of that, just got separated out into its own app and I have to say, it's pretty nice. </p>
<p> Valve's Dota 2 is still one of the most popular games in the e-sports world, and the 2018-2019 season of the Dota Pro Circuit is currently ongoing. If you enjoy watching professional Dota matches, Valve has a new app just for you — Dota Pro Circuit. </p>
<p> A few days ago, Valve released the beta version of the Steam Link app for Android. This means that you can play your Steam library right on your phone, and it's pretty great. Though it's by no means a new concept – we've seen it before with Sony and Nvidia devices – it doesn't require either a PlayStation or a GeForce graphics card. All you need is a Steam library and your phone on the same network, plus a controller, and you're good to go. </p>
<p> Playing games on Android usually means playing mobile games, but Valve could give you more options soon. It's launching a Steam Link app on Android, allowing you to play your PC games on phones and tablets. In addition, Steam Video is coming to Android. Did you know Steam offered video content? Well, it does. </p>
<p> Valve has apparently been working with known Magic: The Gathering designer Richard Garfield since 2014 to come up with an all-new game for PC, consoles, and mobile. It is called Artifact, and it's a Dota 2-themed collectible card game that looks like it will be Valve's answer to Hearthstone. The console and PC release dates are scheduled for the end of 2018, but the sad news is that it will not be hitting Android until mid-2019. </p>
<p> Imagine a world where Bridge Constructor combines its bridge-building gameplay with Valve's puzzle-platformer Portal. Well, imagine no longer as apparently Headup Games have been secretly working on just that very thing. That's right, Bridge Constructor Portal is a thing and it's coming to Android really soon. There is even a trailer available for your viewing pleasure, so hit that "Read More" button and check it out! </p>
<p> Let's be real here: we live on a beautiful planet. While some of our fascinations lie in what is beyond our rock in space, I think that we should take the time to appreciate what we're standing on. It is quite impossible that any one person can see all that this world has to offer, which is why Google Earth is so cool. Today marks the next step for exploring our homeworld by adding the virtual reality element with the appropriately named Earth VR. </p>
<p> Let's state this now: Counter-Strike is awesome. Many an hour has been wasted passed playing the legendary first-person shooter mod for Half-Life, and now even more hours can be whiled away, as the game has come to Android. </p>
<p> Reddit user /u/a1baomarov has posted in /r/Android detailing how to get Counter-Strike working on Android, which involves moving files over from an existing Steam installation, and installing the Xash3D apk. </p>
<p> 95%-100% compability with CS1.6. This requires Xash3D Android >= 0.17. </p>
<p> Install: 1) Install the APK. Install APK with postfix if you have multi-core device and if you have single-core device or have problems with version. </p>

<p> vampires </p>
<p> In the mood to kill some vampires? Or robots? Or comically-large old ladies in bath robes? Fangz has you covered. This sidescrolling shoot-em-up has some Zombieville USA vibes going on, but even a quick look makes it apparent that this game is much, much more ambitious. The amount of weapons, types of enemies, and levels make this seem like an easy 'buy' at $0.99, and watching the trailer, this looks like a shotgun-full of fun. </p>
<p> Baseball is America's game. There's nothing more classic than breaking out the old Louisville Slugger for a round of pick-up, and adding sexy nurses and super-deformed dark knights in no way detracts from the feeling of nostalgia. Such is the case with the well-established Baseball Superstars franchise, which Gamevil is bringing back for another round on Android. The 2013 release was previously restricted to South Korea, Gamevil's home country, but now it's available worldwide with plenty of language options. </p>
<p> Gameloft - the makers of Asphalt, BackStab, and a boatload of other popular Android games - rode into the Google Play Store today with Six-Guns, bringing a Red Dead Redemption-esque shooter to players everywhere. </p>
<p> Following the story of Buck Crosshaw, an outlaw who is presumed dead, Six-Guns allows players to ride through an "open world" set in Arizona and Oregon, fighting off other outlaws as well as vampires and "many other unnatural foes," stirred by a mysterious ancient force. </p>

<p> Vancouver </p>
<p> Capcom announced in a blog post yesterday that it's winding down support for its free-to-play puzzle game, Puzzle Fighter. In-app purchases will be available until April 23, and the game will be removed from app stores on July 1. The game's servers will shut down on July 31, making it unplayable. </p>
<p> Artist Janet Echelman builds giant, living sculptures that respond to the elements around them. These massive works of art typically sway in the wind, flow with the water, or respond to light. This time, Echelman's work is interacting with Chrome. Her piece, built in collaboration with Google Creative Director Aaron Koblin, now descends over water and walkways from a Vancouver skyscraper, changing color in response to the input it receives from visitors on the ground. </p>
<p> Echelman's sculpture is a 300-foot long web browser made of ultralight fibers stretched out against the sky. With the help of five high definition projectors mounted below, it displays the colors provided by a website running in Chrome on a smartphone or tablet. </p>
<p> After just over a year of envious grumbling, the Canadians have finally gotten their first taste of LTE. Rogers Wireless announced today that true 4G speeds are available to customers in specific coverage areas in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver. </p>
<p> While this is surely a cause for excitement for my fellow Canucks, the devices that are currently on this new network aren't. At the time of launch, the only LTE device available to consumers is the Sierra Wireless AirCard 313U, a mobile "LTE Rocket stick" for laptops. On October 18, the HTC Jetstream will hit the market, with an LTE version of the Galaxy S II and the Sierra AirCard 754S mobile hotspot to follow in the weeks after. </p>

<p> Vanguard </p>
<p> If you have investments or a retirement plan with Vanguard, then you'll be pleased to know that it released an Android app to the Market. The app allows you to access up-to-date info about your account, research investments, perform many types of transactions, and get the latest news from Vanguard and Reuters. If you find a story that you think may be of interest to friends and family, you can easily share it through email or social media. </p>
<p> Details are scarce on this one, but a new shot of the HTC Vision has been leaked. With the shot came a few new details: it’s likely headed for T-Mobile (either in the US, overseas, or both), and will be named the G1 Blaze. </p>
<p> As we’ve stated before, the device packs what has quickly become standard fare for high-end phones: </p>
<p> Eclair (Android 2.1) + Sense </p>
<p> HSPA+ (rumored) </p>
<p> If it’s true that this phone is going to be packing HSPA+, it could be a big winner – so far, T-Mobile has no phones that support it, and it’s pretty speedy. </p>
<p> A few days ago, we found a couple of blurrycam pictures of the HTC Vision. Yesterday, a blurrycam shot of T-Mobile’s roadmap leaked, and it shows an HTC Vanguard releasing on September 9. Now, Engadget has word that the HTC Vision is launching in September – the same time the HTC Vanguard is shown launching on T-Mob’s roadmap. The Vision will be T-Mobile’s first HSPA+ phone. (As I’ve mentioned before, HSPA+ is pretty awesomely fast, and expanding like the wind.) </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/vanilla/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549285" filename="vanilla">
<p> In a tweet earlier this evening, the recently resurrected evleaks Twitter account revealed what may be a variant of ZTE's Intel-powered Grand X IN phone which we saw at IFA 2012 headed for Boost Mobile. </p>
<p> ZTE Warp Sequent for Boost Mobile (ZTE Grand X IN): 1.4GHz, 4.3-inch qHD, 5MP cam. 9/17 for $200. twitter.com/evleaks/status… </p>
<p> It's definitely worth noting, though, that this ZTE Grand X IN (if that is what we're looking at) is a tad different from the original. </p>
<p> So here's a novel idea: when a device reaches its end of life, manufacturers should provide users with a way to keep the flame burning. In a nutshell, that's what Lenovo has done with the Ideapad K1. </p>
<p> Here's the gist: the company is finished with this device. They no longer sell it, and it's clear that, past the most recent update (Android 3.2), they no longer plan to support it. So, they made a smart move: they built stock, unmodified Ice Cream Sandwich for the the K1, and released it to the public. </p>
<p> Take this with a massive grain of salt, but BGR has just let loose an article detailing what they claim will be either the next Nexus phone or, if not a Nexus, simply the new Android reference handset. Far more exciting than that is what BGR's source has told them what kind of features the phone will be packing: </p>
<p> A 720p "monster-sized" display - exact size unknown (also, goodbye qHD - nice knowing you) </p>
<p> Dual-core processor @1.2 or 1.5GHz (either a TI OMAP 4460 or a ULP Qualcomm 28nm Krait Snapdragon) </p>
<p> Android Ice Cream Sandwich (possibly dubbed Android 4.0) </p>
<p> Software function buttons (ala Honeycomb - no more capacitive touch) </p>
<p> Remember how we ran that story last week about Virgin Mobile laying the smackdown on manufacturer UI overlays? We liked that. But Virgin Mobile wants the Android community to know that they shouldn't consider the prepaid carrier a safe haven for illicit activities like rooting or custom ROMs - not that that's any different from all the other carriers. Here's what Virgin had to say: </p>
<p> "We do not endorse in any way end users using a non-officially tested operating system nor do we approve of 'rooting' devices. </p>
<p> The invasion continues! Development of CyanogenMod 6 for the Epic 4G is clearly coming along nicely, as a picture of it running has just been released as a quick "status update" on the CM forums. </p>
<p> The fact that it is actually running on the device is encouraging, but we could still be pretty far away from a testable version: no downloads are available yet, and if you look at the notification bar, you'll see a pretty significant bug in this build. </p>
<p> It seems a few community developers (@barakinflorida) have been inching towards releasing a functional, bone stock version of Android 2.1 for the Samsung Galaxy S (That is, without Samsung's TouchWiz interface). Their efforts are paying off, as this video shows. </p>
<p> The only big issues remaining lie in getting the camera/camcorder to actually, well, work. A relatively minor inconvenience, and a problem many developers have struggled with when developing full-ROM releases for phones with UI overlays. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/vapor-x/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17562421" filename="vapor-x">
<p> Misfit makes some very sleek looking smartwatches, and while some of them have weak specs, their designs are all top-notch. One of the main complaints in our review of the Vapor X was the price, so we were already pleased to see Misfit running a $100 off sale for the holidays. Now a new coupon code will get you an additional 20% off every product on the site. </p>
<p> If you’ve been holding off on purchasing the Misfit Vapor X, or one of its forerunners on the basis of price, then you’re in for a treat with an early Black Friday deal from Misfit. The brand is striking off $100 from its entire Wear OS-based smartwatch collection, including its newest offering. Using this pre-applied discount, you can grab the original Misfit Vapor for as low as $80, although without a strap. </p>
<p> After debuting and focusing on activity trackers, Misfit was bought by Fossil and started expanding its portfolio a few years ago to include smartwatches. Its efforts have been mitigated though, and those familiar enough with the Wear OS landscape have noticed how late to the game Misfit's releases have often been. </p>
<p> The first Vapor garnered a lot of hype but lost most of its shine by the time it was finally released. The Vapor 2 came a year later, added the missing NFC and GPS, but was still using an older Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor. This time around, the Vapor X corrects that last misstep but still feels outdated thanks to 512MB of RAM — the same specs as last year's Fossil Sport — instead of the 1GB of RAM we find in Fossil's newer Gen 5 watches. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/variant/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549172" filename="variant">
<p> According to Paul O'Brien of MoDaCo, a "very well placed insider" has indicated that a 3G-connected variant of the device is on the horizon, expected to be ready for shipping "in around six weeks." </p>
<p> If you've been holding out on buying the Nexus 7 due to its WiFi-only capability, this may be the news you've been waiting for. </p>
<p> Keeping true to its reputation for timely updates, ASUS pushed out an official Jelly Bean OTA update to lucky Transformer Pad TF300 owners in North America last Saturday after a quick tease. Now, under a week later, it looks like ASUS has provided the full firmware for download directly from its support site. </p>
<p> The download, which those who didn't receive the OTA (due to an unlocked bootloader or otherwise) can use to get to ASUS' clean Jelly Bean experience, weighs a hefty 438MB and is meant only for users of the US version of the TF300. </p>
<p> After owners of the Nexus S i9023 and i9020T got an official 4.1.1 Jelly Bean OTA last night, the update has become available for the Nexus S' i9020A variant as well. </p>
<p> Just like before, the update can be downloaded straight from Google's servers, though Google has indicated that the OTA should be rolling out to Nexus S phones on "a number of carriers," meaning the wait for an automatic update prompt shouldn't be long. </p>
<p> CyanogenMod 10 is still cooking, and heck, CM9 isn't even fully baked for all devices yet. That hasn't stopped Steve Kondik, aka the guy who puts the Cyanogen in CyanogenMod, from posting preview builds of CM10 over on XDA for the AT&T and T-Mobile Galaxy S III variants. Plus, a third preview build being posted for the Sprint version by another developer. Keep in mind, of course, that "preview build" translates into "absolutely nothing is guaranteed to work." </p>
<p> Mere hours ago, we got confirmation that the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) approved a Verizon-bound version of the SGSIII. Now, we're seeing a similar listing for what is likely a Sprint variant of the Galaxy S III. The device appears in SIG's listing with the model number SPH-L710, which has been rumored to be the designation of the Sprint-branded variant. </p>
<p> The model number is only one character off from the Sprint-branded SGSII (SPHD710), so we're pretty confident this implies that the Galaxy S III will be heading to Sprint, which is the last of the four major US carriers to receive confirmation. </p>
<p> Those who have been waiting for ARCHOS' 1.5GHz variants of the G9 series of tablets are in luck – both tablets' "turbo versions" are now shipping from the manufacturer's web store. </p>
<p> For those who may not be familiar with ARCHOS' G9 series of tablets, here are the specs: </p>
<p> 1024x768 8" or 1280x800 10.1" display </p>
<p> OMAP 4 dual-core processor at 1.5GHz </p>
<p> 8GB flash memory or 250GB HDD (plus a microSD slot) </p>
<p> 1GB RAM </p>
<p> 720p front-facing camera </p>
<p> 1080p video playback </p>
<p> MicroUSB and Mini HDMI ports </p>
<p> With base prices of just $269 and $329 respectively, both G9 tablets make affordable, yet powerful options for those looking to get an Android-powered tablet. </p>
<p> Following the example set by AT&T and T-Mobile's Samsung Galaxy SII variants, Sprint's Epic 4G Touch is set to get its own white counterpart, probably in early 2012. Pocket Now speculates that the Epic 4G Touch's white version may be announced at CES. </p>
<p> Personally, I'm hoping Sprint has a little more to talk about at CES than their own white SII, but the paint job does look rather flattering. While the above shot is all we have to go on for now, we'll be here to cover any other details that may emerge. </p>

<p> Carrying your mobile devices around with you is kind of what they're for, but that might mean venturing far from a power outlet. If you run out of juice, then what? Disaster. You'd probably end up devoured by wolves, or something. Lucky for you there are some killer deals on Powerbag messenger bags today. </p>
<p> Update: Looks like the Vau.lt deal is sold out, folks. </p>
<p> How useful is a portable device with a dead battery? Not useful. What about a bag full of them? Still not useful, and possibly a little dangerous in the wrong part of town. But what if the bag charged those devices for you? No safer, but it's now too awesome to matter. This is what Vault's Powerbag has to offer. The bag comes with a whopping 3K mAh battery and a sporty red exterior, and new members can get their hands on one today for just $14. </p>

<p> The dashcam market is pretty saturated these days, with products ranging in price from $9 (yes, $9) all the way up to $600 or so. As a result, it can be pretty difficult to even get started with your search without being blasted with options. In the ~$100 price range, we've already checked out Anker's Roav C1 Pro and C2 Pro, which we found to be solid offerings. </p>
<p> This time around, we're checking out a dashcam from one of Anker's direct competitors: RAVPower (which owns VAVA). VAVA's Dash Cam 2K can record higher-resolution video than most at this price point, but sacrifices some features to keep costs competitive. </p>
<p> Do you need a dashcam? Do you like free things? Well you're in luck, because we're partnering with dashcam manufacturer VAVA to give away six of the company's 2K cameras. We also have an exclusive coupon code, so if you don't win, you can still buy one for 26% off. </p>
<p> This contest is now over. </p>
<p> The final results are listed below. If you've won, you will be contacted in the near future. Congratulations! </p>

<p> vavo </p>
<p> We first heard about Vavo through its Kickstarter campaign – which was successfully funded by roughly 200% – back in June of last year. The product has been available in the retail scene for a little while now, and I've actually had a pair of them (one white, one black) for the last few months. As such, I've had plenty of time to get a feel for VaVo's strengths, as well as its weaknesses. </p>
<p> As someone with approximately 1600 gadgets laying around the house at all times, I constantly have charging cables everywhere. On the floor. On the desk. On my nightstand. In the kitchen, living room, and even the car. You get the idea. For the longest time, I have used the binder clip trick to manage the flurry of chargers on my desk. But now, UDS – the creators of Capta and Vavo – have a better solution: Snable. </p>
<p> I'd like to think that office/home organization is a pretty big deal to most people, because it certainly is to me. Perhaps it's just my nature, but I live by the motto "a place for everything and everything in its place." Then again, I'm a Virgo, so being a freak about things like that is engrained into my very being (or so I've read, anyway). Ergo, I'm always looking for new ways to make things more organized and easier to find. </p>
<p> A few weeks ago we looked at Capta, a universal mount that adds the ability to mount your smartphone on a tripod. The creators of Capta, UDS, now have a new Kickstarter project that utilizes the same "alien goo" material to bring even more functionality to your smart device. Meet Vavo. </p>
<p> Basically Vavo is a nifty little gadget that uses the same sticky junk as Capta to hold on to your device. </p>

<p> V CAST </p>
<p> Verizon's LG Intuition has long been an awkward kid at the lunch table. With a 5" display at 4:3 resolution, it's had a difficult time being accepted, much less competing. Even so, it has not been completely forgotten – Verizon is preparing to roll out a maintenance update to the device that will remove the Color and V Cast apps, fix some assorted bugs, and should improve speakerphone quality. There is one curious detail to this update, it also adds the Amazon Appstore. </p>
<p> It looks like an update for the Blackberry-style DROID Pro has just hit the Verizon update network, which will bring the current software version up to 3.8.7. It's not as exciting as a Gingerbread update would be, but it does bring some welcome bug fixes and UI enhancements. </p>
<p> Also included in this update are several Exchange ActiveSync improvements, like calendar synchronization. The rest of this update consists primarily of bug fixes, a Bluetooth voice recording enhancement, and the addition of Verizon's V CAST Appstore. </p>
<p> Verizon's announcement of a separate Big Red branded Android Market, called the V Cast App Store, sent shockwaves through the Androidosphere a month ago, with the general consensus being: "we don't want it." Of course, none of us could actually prevent Verizon from fragmenting our Market situation further (they've already done their part with the MOTOBLUR to help fragment the Android OS itself), so all we have to do is go with the flow and see what exactly Verizon's cooked up. </p>

<p> vector </p>
<p> Anki's Vector robot launched in October. The little guy is certainly cute, and it's always had a useful trick or two; it can tell you the temperature outside or set timers, for example. But starting next week in the US and Canada, Vector is getting a whole lot more practical with the addition of Alexa functionality. </p>
<p> In late 2016, San Francisco-based robotics company Anki released Cozmo, a robotic toy brimming with personality. The little guy looked like something out of Wall-E, with its curious animation and expressive digital eyes. Now, Anki's back at it with a new tiny robot named Vector that clearly shares Cozmo's DNA, but promises more functionality. </p>
<p> The original Vector was a hit when it came out a few years ago, and now the developer has released Vector 2. The gameplay is similar to the first one, but the upgrade system is much more extensive. It's actually a little confusing. Such is the cost of progress, I suppose. </p>
<p> The first Android Studio v1.4 preview release came out just a short six weeks ago, and now it's moving into the Stable channel, right on schedule. The features remain largely the same as the original v1.4 preview, but a ton of bugs have been fixed and a few of the capabilities have been improved in some awesome ways. </p>
<p> With the official stable release of Android Studio v1.3 a couple of weeks ago, it's time to begin testing the next string of new features. The first preview release of version 1.4 is now in the Canary channel, and it's sporting some big new features. The Android Tools team has been working on the new theme editor first demonstrated in the I/O session titled What's New in Android Development Tools. There are also new performance monitors for GPU and network activity, a vector asset wizard for turning SVG files into XML vector drawables, and a few new lint checks. </p>
<p> Here is the Google I/O session video cued up to the beginning of the theme editor demo at 36 minutes: </p>
<p> Theme Editor </p>
<p> The new theme editor examines the styles in a project and displays visual samples of what controls should look like on a live interface. </p>
<p> Adobe, would you just pick a version of Photoshop for Android and stick with it? After unceremoniously dumping the conventional image editor Photoshop Touch last month and leaving us with the more Instagram-style Photoshop Express, Adobe has now released Photoshop Mix on the Play Store after a period of iOS exclusivity. This app is more powerful than Express, but less powerful than Touch, and attempts to bring a more manageable interface to phones. </p>
<p> In particular the new app has selection tools and basic layer functionality, meaning it's suitable for at least some advanced image editing functions beyond mere touch-ups and filters. </p>
<p> It's that time again. Another bundle of games has hit the web courtesy of the Humble Bundle folks, and as always, they're charging the sweet price of whatever-you-feel-like-paying. There are six games up for grabs this time around, with two requiring you to pay over the average. </p>
<p> Regardless how much you pay, the Humble Bundle will let you walk out with a digital version of the popular board game Catan ($3.99), the jetski racer Riptide GP2 ($2.99), the parkour simulator Vector ($0.99), and that game where you shoot zombies from the comfort of an AC-130 gunship - Zombie Gunship ($0.99). </p>
<p> There have been plenty of 2D side-scrolling action platformer games on Android, but Vector tweaks that formula in a really engaging way. You have to escape from the insidious clutches of "Big Brother" using your freerunner skills. Vector is essentially an amalgamation of Canabalt and Mirror's Edge. If that doesn't get you interested, you must not like games. </p>
<p> All the controls are handled through simple swipes to jump, slide, sprint, and dodge. You've got to time things right so you pick up coins and avoid obstacles. There is also a nasty thug right on your tail, and he's perfectly happy to take you out if you falter during your getaway. </p>

<p> A fresh version of the Android Support Library is now available to developers. This may be one of the biggest updates in quite a while, as some of the changes demand a few significant internal changes. On the plus side, there aren't very many changes that should break existing code, and most of the new features will make it worth the trouble. Here's a quick introduction to some of the new changes. </p>

<p> vector unit </p>
<p> Beach Buggy Racing 2 is the latest kart racer from Vector Unit, a developer that knows its way around creating some of the best free-to-play racers on Android. This release is a sequel to the original Beach Buggy Racing, and it brings with it improved graphics, new drivers, new vehicles, upgradeable power-ups, and several new game modes. </p>
<p> Vector Unit has enjoyed a pretty good reputation on Android for a good while now. Not only have they released some pretty popular titles but they have also gone out of their way to support the Android platform more than most. Things like Play Games achievements, leaderboards, and cloud saving have all been a standard for the studio since their inception. Making sure to provide HID controller and Android TV support is also a big plus for them. When you take all of this into consideration, it is no surprise that they have gone on to perform exceedingly well, and deservedly so. </p>
<p> Vector Unit has cultivated a reputation as one of the most consistently solid developers on Android, so a new release from them is always a good thing. But when it's a new entry in the Riptide GP series, then it's time to call the boss and tell him you're (cough, cough) "sick." Riptide GP: Renegade is the third installment, and SHIELD Android TV owners can play it right now, only a few days after the PC and console release. </p>
<p> The original Beach Buggy Blitz was one of the first graphically-intensive games on Android, a frequent install for people who wanted to show off the power of their new phone or tablet. That being said, it was a bit simplistic: you "raced" along an endless beach, more or less playing catch up until you ran out of time. The sequel, Beach Buggy Racing, is much more of a conventional kart racer. It's got full races, power-ups, multiple characters and carts, and even single-device split screen multiplayer. </p>
<p> The graphics are a little better in the sequel, though the handling is what has really improved. </p>
<p> I've never been a huge fan of racing games, but there's always been something about Hydro Thunder that captivated me. As a teen, it was one of my favorite games, and I've kept up with the franchise as much as possible over the last several years. Naturally, this means I've spent a more-than-ample amount of time playing Riptide GP, the mobile-equivalent to Hydro Thunder. </p>
<p> The first Riptide was one of my favorite games to emerge from the Tegra 2 era, and Vector Unit maintained fantastic support over the past two years, even updating it to support enhanced graphics on the Tegra 3 chip. </p>
<p> In an impromptu Reddit AmA earlier today, Vector Unit – the development team behind Riptide GP, Beach Buggy Blitz, and Shine Runner – announced that Riptide GP 2 will be hitting the Google Play Store on July 23rd for just $3. </p>
<p> You may remember Riptide GP 2 from its debut on NVIDIA's SHIELD back in March, which showed off the game's updated effects, physics, and overall improved gameplay. Naturally, GP 2 is optimized for NVIDIA's Tegra 4 chip, which means that it will be one of the many games pushing SHIELD to the max once it's released to the masses. </p>
<p> Vector Unit – the development team behind Riptide GP, Shine Runner, and Beach Buggy Blitz – has long been taking advantage of NVIDIA's Tegra processors. In fact, Riptide was one of the games used to show off the power of the Tegra 2 back in the day, and it was even updated to add enhanced graphics for the Tegra 3, once again highlighting the power of Tegra. </p>
<p> Now, NVIDIA has released a teaser video showing off Riptide GP 2, which will of course be optimized for the Tegra 4 and its 72 GPU cores. The gameplay looks similar to the original Riptide GP, but the waves are larger, curves are tighter, jumps are bigger, and, of course, the graphics are better. </p>
<p> When it came out early last month, Beach Buggy Blitz was one of an increasing number of Tegra-exclusive titles to hit the Play Store, which understandably upset some people. Namely, those people without Tegra devices (what a great excuse to buy a Nexus 7, though). </p>
<p> Now, the game has gone for a wider audience, and is available for most modern, high-end phones. The only specific handsets named are the Galaxy S III / II and One series, but there are obviously plenty of others that should be able to handle Buggy Blitz. </p>
<p> The update for non-Tegra compatibility also brings a Halloween theme to the game, which adds the "Grim Rod" car and two new drivers. </p>
<p> Recently, Vector Unit - the team behind Riptide GP and Shine Runner - released a new game called Beach Buggy Blitz. This one is slightly different than VU's previous offerings, as it leaves the boat/hovercraft racing behind and takes to the beach for a fun, whimsical spin in a buggy. </p>
<p> We've been playing around with this game since its release and are pretty impressed so far. Here's a look at what you can expect from BBB. </p>
<p> Editor's Note: This is the first post from Tim Schofield - better known as QBKing77 - here at AP. Welcome him! </p>
<p> The game is free in the Play Store, but is currently only available on Tegra 2/3 devices. </p>
<p> If you're not familiar with Vector Unit, you should be - they're responsible for such Android racing hits as Riptide GP and Shine Runner. Their latest title, Beach Buggy Blitz, has the player racing through a pristine tropical wonderland. You'll see white beaches, verdant forests and adorable local wildlife, all of which will be crushed under the tires of your 4-wheel-drive PETA-punisher of choice. Like Shine Runner, there are no opponents - just get the best time. Powerups augment multiple vehicles and racers for a surprisingly complete experience. Those of you who aren't fans of touchscreen controls will be glad to know that Beach Buggy Blitz supports tilt controls and external gamepads. </p>

<p> vega </p>
<p> If you've been looking for a not-small-enough-to-be-a-phone-but-not-big-enough-to-be-a-tablet device (and the Dell Streak 5 just isn't your cup of tea), then the upcoming Pantech Vega No.5 may be just what the doctor ordered. Before we dive into the specs, you should be aware that there is no word on when (or if) the Vega No.5 will ever become available internationally, but it will be available in Korea later this month. </p>
<p> It definitely looks like the Vega No.5 packs a nice punch underneath its semi-large hood. </p>
<p> Two-for-one on this post: Japanese carrier KDDI revealed this morning that they'll be selling a customized version of Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Tab. On a similar tablet note, it looks like the Advent Vega will be joining the list of budget Android tablets that won't have the market. Turns out we've never covered the Vega either, so I'll provide a few extra details on it. Let's start with the Galaxy Tab: what's custom about it? </p>

<p> vehicle hotspot </p>
<p> OnStar, GM's connected car service, has been standard on all of the company's cars and trucks for years. The basic functionality includes remote access, vehicle diagnostics, and some other simple connected features, with more advanced fare like GPS navigation and theft protection hidden behind paid tiers. For the last few years Chevrolet has also offered in-car Wi-Fi hotspots powered by the OnStar system, connected to AT&T's LTE network. Following the latest tweaks in AT&T's unlimited plans for smartphones, the companies are now offering unlimited data to cars, too. </p>
<p> We've seen mobile hotspots for cars before, but I don't think I've ever heard of one that uses the ODB-II communications port on your vehicle for power, freeing up that precious cigarette lighter for things like chargers. The ZTE Mobley is just that. </p>
<p> Power is, of course, provided from the ODB-II port on your vehicle, and the hotspot theoretically should only function when the vehicle is on or in accessory mode. This leaves your precious cigarette lighter free for things like chargers, and also removes the associated bulk of what is likely to be an at least semi-permanent accessory for your vehicle. </p>

<p> Today Google has revealed more info on its new standalone Android platform for cars. Unlike Android Auto, which just casts info from your phone onto whatever software your vehicle maker has tossed together, the new system is based on Android and brings some of the same tools Android Auto had natively. Google revealed this initiative at last year's I/O, but there hasn't been much news apart from Chrysler's concept back at CES. Both Audi and Volvo will be making use of the new systems in future vehicles. </p>
<p> Most of us don't have the money or smooth-talking skills necessary to walk into a luxury car dealership and ask for a test drive of the latest vehicle, or even just get the chance to sit down behind the wheel and use our imagination. But thanks to the marvels of modern technology, there's no need to even put yourself in such an precarious situation. Just reach for your Android tablet and fire up AOL's Autoblog 360. This app will sit you in the front seat of many luxury vehicles and give you a 360-degree look around that would make Google Maps proud. </p>

<p> Do you enjoy knowing how fast things are? Then Qualcomm's revamped Vellamo suite is probably something you should check out. Vellamo has been the web benchmark of choice on Android for some time now, but this new update brings some major improvements. </p>
<p> First, the UI: it's completely different. It's actually really nice, certainly the prettiest benchmarking tool I've ever seen on Android (I mean, who really cares, but still). Just look at the screenshots: </p>
<p> The next big change comes in the form of a brand-new CPU benchmark called Metal. </p>
<p> It's a well-known fact that Android enthusiasts love benchmarks. When new devices hit our hands, what is one of the first things we do? Run benchmarks. It's how we compare devices to one another, and what we use to develop the standards on which future devices will be set. At this point, we use a set of benchmarking tools that have become clutch throughout the community: Quadrant, Linpack, SmartBench, etc. </p>
<p> Now, Qualcomm is getting into the benchmarking game with a new web benchmark called Vellamo that aims to judge device performance in areas that really matter: rendering, javascript, networking, and user experience. </p>

<p> Velocity Micro </p>
<p> We've all heard of the low-budget Velocity Cruz tablets before, and it looks like company is keeping the brand alive in 2012 with a pair of Android 4.0 tablets. </p>
<p> As expected, these aren't the most powerful portables on the planet -- but, then again, they'll likely have a price to match. The smaller of the duo is the Cruz T507, a 7-inch slate with a Cortex A8 1.2GHz processor, 512MB RAM, 8GB internal store, front-facing camera, HDMI out, and Amazon's Appstore as its go-to marketplace. </p>
<p> There really are a lot of tablets being announced at CES 2011, and Velocity Micro just launched their new lineup of Android tablets as well: the 7" Cruz Tablet L37, the 8" Cruz Tablet P38, and the 10.1" Cruz Tablet L510. </p>
<p> The 7" L37 has a 1024x600 capacitive touch screen, while the 8" P38 has a 1024x768 screen, and both come with 802.11n WiFi and 4GB of internal memory. The 10.1" P38 has a 1366x768 capacitive touch screen and runs on the NVIDIA Tegra 250 Chipset with a 1GHz dual-core CPU. </p>
<p> Velocity Micro’s Android tablet called Cruz is now available for pre-order from Borders.com and CruzReader.com at a bargain price of $299.99. </p>
<p> The CruzReader.com order page is currently citing a late September release date, while Borders.com is expected to ship October 15th, so you may have to wait for a number of weeks before you can get your hands on one yourself. </p>
<p> After seeing the specs and the price, we think this tablet could very well be a genuine competitor in the market. </p>

<p> velvet </p>
<p> It's always unusual when one variant of a phone gets different specs than all the others, but that's what's happened with T-Mobile's LG Velvet. For some reason, T-Mobile decided they wanted a Velvet with a MediaTek chipset — something no other Velvet variant globally has. Plus, it has a smaller battery. Granted, this model is pretty cheap at $588, but we'd expect a little more discount for the lesser specs. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/07/21 10:11am PDTon Jul 21, 2020 and last updated 2020/08/18 9:53am PDTon Aug 18, 2020. </p>
<p> We're deep into summer and almost due for a couple of new phones from Samsung and Apple. Perfect time, then, for LG to finally bring around its new Velvet smartphone from overseas to the U.S. market. It came to AT&T late in July and is eventually going to make it to T-Mobile, but we now know exactly when Verizon will bring it to customers. </p>
<p> LG could use a win. While it once innovated with modular hardware and pushing the whole industry past 16:9 screens, it's been hard to find any unambiguous successes over the last few generations of G- and V-series flagships. That's not to say that they weren't decently good phones, but none really stood out — maybe the V40 was one of the best, but even then we couldn't recommend paying big money for it. Is it time to take things back to the drawing board? </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/07 8:12am PDTon May 7, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/15 5:54am PDTon Jun 15, 2020. </p>
<p> As we're used to for the past several years now, LG leaves very few secrets on the table about the phones it's going to launch. Indeed, the new Velvet phone was teased quite early on as the successor to the longstanding G-series. Tomorrow, it goes on pre-sale in South Korea and we're now getting a clearer look at what we can expect out of the phone. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/20 4:20am PDTon Apr 20, 2020 and last updated 2020/04/24 2:42am PDTon Apr 24, 2020. </p>
<p> LG's smartphone business has been in trouble for some time thanks to uninspiring hardware, dated software, and a dismal record on updates. The most recent LG flagships — the G8X ThinQ and V60 ThinQ — launched with dual-screen gimmicks that tried to piggyback on the folding phone fad, but neither have enough going for them to turn the company's fortunes around. Oh, those name surely don't help either. We now know that the G series is to be replaced by something entirely new, and LG hasn't been shy about giving us more details. </p>
<p> Looks like Samsung and Motorola have been hanging out at the local trademark office again, as both companies have registered names of some upcoming devices. </p>
<p> Samsung registered three new names (because we know how much they love to release at least one new Galaxy device every month week): the Galaxy Metrix, Velvet, and Legend (cough HTC cough). Aside from that, we only know that all three names were registered as "goods and services: mobile telephones, smartphones." Surprise, surprise. </p>
<p> Motorola also trademarked the name of an upcoming device: the "Electrify Icon," which can be assumed to be a sequel to last year's Electrify smartphone (aka Photon 4G). </p>

<p> PayPal is launching support for U.S. customers to trade and hold cryptocurrency and to use it as a funding source for retail purchases. The payments processing company has expedited plans for global expansion as it looks to catch the first big wave of future digital public currencies. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/18 9:35am PDTon Apr 18, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/29 10:12am PDTon Jul 29, 2020. </p>
<p> Paying and getting paid is easier than ever, but the various apps you can choose to transact with have their upsides and downsides. Picking one can be difficult, and signing up for all of them even more so — especially when it often means convincing friends and family to do so as well. But old school bank ACH transfer tools are for the birds, and cold, hard cash remains a dicey proposition in the current environment. Splitting the bill with cash is also just a pain, and newer peer to peer (P2P) payment apps are so much more convenient that it's truly silly in 2020 not to be using one. </p>
<p> PayPal-owned Venmo is rolling out a new paintjob for its app, cutting down on its signature blue for more white and making it easier to get to paying or requesting money. </p>
<p> Back in July, Uber announced that Venmo, PayPal's strange mobile payment service/social media feed combo, would be added as a payment method "in the coming weeks." It's been about seven weeks since then, and Venmo support has just gone live for both Uber and Uber Eats. </p>
<p> PayPal has revealed today that it will be adding Venmo as an option during checkout. For now, it will be opt-in for users of Venmo and will manifest itself with the same convenience as PayPal. During the checkout process, users will be able to select Venmo with no changes required by sellers. There is no additional cost to the customer or retailer to use Venmo over PayPal. </p>
<p> Mobile payments app Venmo has been around for years now, but without two-factor authentication, security hasn't been as good as it could be. Fortunately the company is now getting around to changing that. Today it announced that it has added two-factor authentication to its mobile apps (Android and iOS) as well as the web. </p>
<p> When you attempt to sign into Venmo from a new phone, the service will send you a 6-digit code that you will need in order to get inside. </p>
<p> Going forward, Venmo will automatically enable this feature for anyone who uses the latest version of the app. </p>
<p> One of PayPal's problems is that it's immensely popular. As the service implements more features and grows to support a larger user base, it inevitably loses some people along the way. If you want an app that makes it easy to send money to friends that isn't PayPal, Venmo is worth a look. It's simple, doesn't charge to send money from most bank accounts or debit cards, and it just received an update that makes the experience look more at home on Android. </p>
<p> In addition to the new look, Venmo now has a home screen widget that enables faster payments. </p>
<p> If there are two words that can quickly get people excited, it's "free money." And we just so happened to have some to give away, thanks to Venmo. Haven't heard of Venmo? Here's the skinny: it's a quick, easy, and efficient way to instantly send money to friends. Kind of like Paypal, but without the Paypal-ness of it all – it's all just very simple and straightforward. </p>
<p> The fees are also extremely reasonable: transferring money from your Venmo balance is free, as are payments funded by U.S. bank accounts and most debit cards. Only credit card transfers are subject to the standard 3% convenience fee. </p>

<p> Fossil is one of the most prominent Wear OS manufacturers around, and, in my opinion, its latest offerings are among the sleekest, most stylish, and feature-packed smartwatches on the market. Whether you're shopping around for your next watch or you're searching for a last-minute Valentine's Day gift for that special someone, now is the perfect time to pick up a Fossil Gen 4 Venture. Several retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, and Fossil, just slashed its price to a new all-time low of $129 — which represents a savings of $146 off the MSRP or roughly $30 off recent pricing. </p>
<p> Fossil is one of the leading Wear OS smartwatch manufacturers, and I personally like the brand's timepieces for their stylish design and overall features. Among the company's top products is the fourth-generation Venture, which came out a year ago but still features decent specs and great looks. Four of the timepiece's variants have just gone one sale for $175, which is $100 off their original retail price. </p>

<p> After being thoroughly unimpressed with the sleek and sexy DROID Charge last week, and knowing that the Venue was next on my device-review checklist, I was prepared for yet more disappointment. Let's face it - Dell has been the butt of quality control, technical support, and advertising (Dude! you're...) jokes for years now. Whether or not it has at all been deserved is another matter entirely - after all, Dell is a hugely successful company (I happen to be writing this review on a Dell netbook, in fact). </p>
<p> Do you have $500 laying around to spend on a smartphone? Well then, have we got a deal for you - Dell's most attractive piece of Android hardware to date, the Venue (formerly know by its code name "Thunder"), is up for grabs on Dell's website right now. At $500, it's not too exorbitant a price for an unlocked handset, and you get your choice of frequency band versions: AT&T or T-Mobile. </p>

<p> venue 10 </p>
<p> Dell's recent Venue 8 7000 was one of the most interesting tablets from Dell in... well, ever. Now it's trying its hand at something bigger with the Venue 10 7000. Dell is pitching this as a work machine, and you can buy it today starting at $499. </p>
<p> As part of a series of education-oriented product announcements, Dell is introducing the Venue 10, a Lollipop-enabled Android tablet. The device, which will have a "Pro" sibling that runs Windows 8.1, is set to debut in the spring and will be Google Apps for Education certified. While it will fall short of being a high-end tablet and may not have wide availability, it does have a few cool features. </p>
<p> Dell's release says the Venue 10 line will have "HD or Full HD" 10.1 inch screens, making it unclear whether these will be options or if the 1080p display will apply only to the Pro model. </p>

<p> Dell's Android-powered Venue tablets from last year were more than adequate, but failed to make a definitive impression on the crowded Android market despite reasonable specs and low prices. The Texas company is hoping that a quick refresh of the hardware on the 7-inch and 8-inch models will help move a few more units... and hopefully a few lucrative accessories as well. Updated versions of the Venue 7 and Venue 8 will run Android 4.4 out of the box. </p>
<p> Dell began sending out Android 4.3 updates to it's budget Atom-based Android tablets late last year, but it's been a super-slow rollout. Well, now it's picking up steam. The OTA should be hitting both tablets soon, if not already. </p>
<p> Dell isn't giving up on its tablet ambitions quite yet. The company has announced a slew of new devices today, two of which are Android slates. The Venue 7 and 8 are entry-level Android tablets running on Intel Atom chips, and you'll be able to buy them later this month for a competitive price. </p>

<p> venue 8 </p>
<p> While the Dell Venue 8 is a tablet we considered quite solid (and now it even has Lollipop), there's no denying it was always really, really pricey. $450 isn't exactly the going rate for many Android tablets these days as the premium segment of the market never really materialized in a big way. To help ease the sticker shock of the unabashedly good-looking Venue 8, Amazon is chopping 20% off the top of that MSRP today in a Gold Box deal. </p>
<p> That means you can get the 32GB Venue 8 for just $359 (OK, $358.99, you got me), which is $10 less than the lowest price we've seen the 16GB version at. </p>
<p> It has been a long wait for the Lollipop update for the Dell Venue 8 7840. Dell has missed several deadlines to get Lollipop rolled out to this device, but now it's here. Android 5.0.2 is available for download from the update menu right now. </p>
<p> The Dell Venue 8 7840 was released in early 2015, and it was a pretty good tablet. It's certainly the best Android slate Dell has ever made. It was slightly annoying to have the device launch with KitKat back then, but it still doesn't have Lollipop all these months later. That hasn't stopped Dell from updating its product page to claim the Venue 8 does in fact run Lollipop. Here's everything we've learned from Dell about this mess. </p>
<p> Dell has a new Android tablet, and it's actually interesting for once. You don't usually think of Dell as a leader in the area of tablet design, but that's what seems to be happening here. The new Dell Venue 8 7000 series tablet is currently the thinnest slate in the world at just 6mm. Ignoring for a moment whether or not it's a good design, you can't deny that's impressive—even the iPad is thicker. The Venue 8 makes some compromises to get there, but maybe that's okay. Let's see how this tablet measures up. </p>
<p> Dell has been making Android tablets for a while, but none of them have been terribly interesting. The new Venue 8, on the other hand, stands out in a sea of freakishly similar slates. This is the thinnest tablet in the world at only 6mm (a whole one-tenth of a millimeter thinner than the iPad Air 2) and it showcases some neat camera tricks thanks to its Intel hardware. It's been vaporware so far, but now you can get one at Best Buy for $399.99. </p>
<p> Dell's Android-powered Venue tablets from last year were more than adequate, but failed to make a definitive impression on the crowded Android market despite reasonable specs and low prices. The Texas company is hoping that a quick refresh of the hardware on the 7-inch and 8-inch models will help move a few more units... and hopefully a few lucrative accessories as well. Updated versions of the Venue 7 and Venue 8 will run Android 4.4 out of the box. </p>
<p> The biggest change on the inside is an upgrade to Intel's Merrifield family of low-power x86 chips: the Atom Z3460 (dual-core 1.6Ghz) on the Venue 7 and Atom Z3480 (dual-core 2.1Ghz) on the Venue 8. </p>
<p> If you missed this deal on the Dell Venue 8 the last time it rolled around, consider this your chance at frugal redemption. Dell's official online store is once again discounting the Intel-powered Android tablet by a respectable $50 on all models. Head to the listing, select your capacity, and apply the code J41TT1LGPH2RD2 to get the discount. </p>
<p> This deal starts at 10:00 AM Eastern Time on Monday and ends tomorrow at 7:00 AM. The quantities are limited by Dell and there's no telling just how much stock they've set aside, so get a move on if you want a discounted tablet. </p>
<p> There are plenty of Android tablets out there worthy of your attention, but Dell's offerings might not be at the top of your list. With $50 off, though, you might want to take another look. The retailer is offering a discount on the 16 and 32GB variants of the Dell Venue 8 until February 13th. </p>

<p> It's been a couple of years since the Autofill API was added to Android and you've been able to use Google or other password managers to fill in your credentials and log in to apps. However, while most third-party password apps require you to verify your identity before releasing your details to another app, Google's autofill just surrendered those details willy-nilly as long as your phone was unlocked. That's not so secure. A recent change to Play Services fixes that by letting you require an on-the-spot authentication before Google autofills the data fields. </p>
<p> Twitter has quite a troublesome history with verified accounts. For a long time, it's been unclear when an account qualifies to get the blue checkmark, and following controversy over verified white supremacists in 2017, the company essentially halted the program, promising to revamp it in the future. It looks like that time is about to come, as app sleuth Jane Manchun Wong spotted some code on the Twitter website pointing to a "Request verification" option in Settings. </p>
<p> YouTube has always been one of Google's less conventional properties, but the sudden leap from version 6.0 to 10.0 gave everybody a surprise. Even stranger is that with such a substantial jump in versions, there are virtually zero meaningful changes to the user-facing features. While there's relatively little for us to enjoy right now, a full teardown reveals that there are at least a few additions that might be worthy of a major version bump. </p>
<p> Video Filters </p>
<p> It's no secret that YouTube is set to gain some basic editing features. Reports have been coming in that the trimming feature discovered back in November has finally started going live. </p>
<p> You hear a lot of reports about malware and other undesirable third-party apps these days, especially from security researchers (and people who want to sell you something to make you feel safe). It's undeniable that malicious apps are a problem on an open system, but new data from Google indicates that the amount of actual harm being done might be negligible. QZ.com reports on a presentation from Google's Android Security Chief Adrian Ludwig at the Virus Conference in Berlin. He estimates that .001% of Android apps are able to get past Google's defenses. </p>
<p> Remember when Google's app verification and malware scanning service debuted with Android 4.2? No? Well, that's probably because statistically speaking, you're likely to be one of the 95% of Android users rocking 4.1 or earlier. To help address this, it looks like Google has moved the Verify Apps system to Google Play Services, which at this point should be installed on all Google Play Store-equipped Android devices running Gingerbread or higher. The change was spotted by JR Raphael at ComputerWorld. </p>
<p> Verify Apps is not to be confused with the "Bouncer," Google's Play Store watchdog that keeps an eye on the included Android apps, to greater or lesser success. </p>
<p> Update: Tim Bray responded in our comments letting us know Trevor Johns, a hands-on guy in the Android back-rooms, was the author of the post. </p>
<p> After we blew the faults behind Google's License Verification Library out of the water last week, Google's Tim Bray promised us some tips for protecting our applications against piracy, and in the latest post at Google's official Android blog he delivered them. Tim's article is loaded with easy to follow sample code, and advice that just makes sense. Mr. Bray covers several protection methods including: </p>
<p> making your application tamper resistant (with a code sample that is nearly identical to what I published a week ago), </p>
<p> and using a secondary server for added protection. </p>
<p> [Update: 8/24/10 @ 7:45 PM EST by Aaron] Tim Bray responded to Justin's article, but seems to have misunderstood the goal. Thus, Justin has written a follow-up article here. </p>
<p> Preface </p>
<p> This article was not written to teach people how to pirate or ridicule Google's Android License Verification Library (LVL) that handles communication with Google's Android Market Licensing Service. </p>
<p> I am very much against piracy, and very much pro-Google. I have spent more time researching copy protection for my applications than development of the applications themselves. </p>
<p> I would like to thank: </p>
<p> the author of Star Hunt for allowing me to use his application in my demo video </p>
<p> the author of Tasker for allowing me to use his application, which has the best implementation of LVL I found, in this article </p>
<p> Both of these applications are available in the market - I highly suggest you give them a try. </p>

<p> verification codes </p>
<p> Last year, a new "verification code autofill" setting appeared as part of a Play Services update that promised to plug the SMS-based 2FA gap for apps that use Android's snazzy SMS Retriever API for verification codes. In short, it would be another way to autofill SMS 2FA codes that might be able to work with any app, regardless of developer support. And based on user reports, the feature may be rolling out. </p>
<p> Certain apps are able to automatically input SMS verification codes through Google's SMS Retriever API. If the app doesn't utilize the API, Android Messages is able to detect those codes and let users copy them right from the SMS notification. Now, it appears that Google is about to close the gap by having its own Autofill service pull SMS verification codes all by itself with the latest Google Play services update. </p>
<p> Some apps and websites allow you to log in using just an email address or phone number thanks to Facebook's Account Kit SDK. Until now, two-factor codes for mobile logins were sent via SMS only, but an update is adding WhatsApp verification. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/verified-calls/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17552127" filename="verified-calls">
<p> Despite attempts by legislators and carriers, spam calls are still a problem for most people owning phones. Some don't pick up their phones at all unless it matches someone in their contacts, which can be a problem for legitimate businesses attempting to quickly reach customers. Google's solution to the problem is Verified Calls, which is now rolling out to the Google Phone app. At the same time, the company is allowing some devices to download the Phone app from the Play Store that didn't originally come with it. </p>
<p> Even though we don't generally use our phones for calling as much these days, the actual phone part of your phone is still important. Google has long worked to make phone calls less annoying with features like automatic call screening and spam detection. Now, it looks like a new Verified Calls feature is rolling out to help consumers know why a business is calling them before they pick up. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/verified-sms/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17561480" filename="verified-sms">
<p> Earlier this year, our APK guru Cody discovered signs of Verified SMS coming to Google's Messages app. At the time, we didn't know what the feature was exactly or how it'd work. With it starting to go live now, we've discovered that it doesn't work for all numbers, just businesses, and specifically those registered with Google. </p>
<p> The latest update to Google Messages is out and sporting much the same look as always. The major notes to be seen are in the teardown, which brings a few smaller details related to RCS settings and Verified SMS, hints at an auto-reply feature for spam messages, a change to the audio clip recorder, and a little refocusing on the upcoming Google Assistant integration. </p>
<p> Google Messages just received its 4.2 update today as it adds a subtle but potentially valuable feature: Sending generic file types. Yes, you can now send files without being limited to just the standard photo and video collection. A teardown also brings follow-ups to the topics of Verified SMS and Google Assistant integration. </p>

<p> verify apps </p>
<p> Play Protect, the fancy reincarnation of Verify Apps that promises to make app scanning and malware detection more visible to users, has been promised since Google I/O but it took a while for it to start showing up. First, we noticed that the Verify Apps security setting was changed to Play Protect, but that is a buried menu that few people would often run into. Now, the more user-facing aspect is starting to show up in the Play Store. </p>
<p> If you head over to the My apps & games section in the Play Store, you might see the new Play Protect banner on top of all your available and recent updates. </p>
<p> Back at Google I/O in May, Google announced Play Protect, the consumer-facing evolution of Verify Apps, which is the background app check service that makes sure you don't have any suspicious or malicious software installed on your device. Verify Apps has existed for many years and has grown from an opt-in feature to an opt-out one, then to a background process, and then earlier in February it started displaying the apps it had scanned. </p>
<p> Play Protect aims to bring Verify Apps to the foreground in the Play Store and make sure that all users are aware that their device's security is being monitored. </p>
<p> Google rolled out the Verify Apps framework many years ago to scan apps as they were installed. Then, in 2014 it added the ability to constantly scan apps to watch for malicious behavior. You were sort of taking Google at its word as a user that Verify Apps was indeed rummaging around to keep tabs on things. Now you can see some of what it's doing—the settings menu now shows which apps have recently been scanned. </p>
<p> Google has released its second Android Security Annual report, and it's full of big, impressive numbers. The full report is 49 pages long and covers the state of Android security in detail, but the basics are covered in Google's latest blog post. The gist is, Google scans all the things to keep Android users safe. We're talking about billions of apps; the Verify Apps service sure is working overtime. </p>
<p> Google's previously announced enhancement to the Verify Apps framework is rolling out to users now, according to the official Android blog. Your device already has the standard Verify Apps system built-in that scans at the time of installation, but the new version will be watching all the time for suspicious activity. </p>
<p> Verify Apps compares each app you install with known malware signatures, but there's always a possibility you are downloading a form of malware that hasn't been identified yet. An app might also install malicious code by some means after it has passed through the filter successfully. That's why Google is ramping up its scanning system. </p>
<p> Android malware isn't as big of a concern as some mainstream media reports would have you believe, but it is enough of an issue that Google started beefing up its security a few years ago. There's the "Bouncer" server-side scanning that checks apps before they go live, and your device runs app verification as new packages are installed. Now Google is about to patch a hole in the local app scanning by making it run continuously. </p>

<p> Verizon may be pushing its 5G mmWave network hard (even if it's of doubtful utility), but it's not actually the only 5G tech on big red's roadmap. Like T-Mobile, it's pushing a lower-band "Nationwide" solution as well, and an update will soon be rolling out to select 5G phones delivering access to that more far-reaching network. Furthermore, new 5G phones on Verizon will have it at launch. </p>
<p> Samsung may have pushed back the launch of its Galaxy Fold, but it has another stupid expensive flagship phone to launch: the Galaxy S10 5G. Verizon has just announced that the S10 5G will be available May 16th starting at a whopping $1,299.99, with pre-orders opening today. The 20 cities in which 5G will be offered in 2019 were also revealed. </p>

<p> verizon carrier billing android </p>
<p> If you're a Verizon Wireless customer, you might be seeing a new payment option in your Play Store billing screen this morning. That option, as you've probably guessed, is carrier billing. We reported on the announcement just a couple of weeks ago. </p>
<p> For a lot of folks, this is easier than adding a credit card to the Play Store, but if you've got kids (or other spendthrift loved ones), this presents a new and exciting danger to your wallet. </p>
<p> Google has just confirmed on the official Play Store Twitter account that carrier billing for Verizon customers will be making its way to handsets in the coming weeks. </p>
<p> Hey @verizon Customers! Pay for Google Play apps, music and more on your phone bill. We're rolling this out over the coming weeks. Enjoy! </p>
<p> Verizon joins Sprint, AT&T (on some devices only), and T-Mobile, all of which have carrier billing, rounding out the US's big four. </p>

<p> verizon edge </p>
<p> T-Mobile seems to be making waves in the industry as of late. Not even two weeks after the magenta carrier announced it would be paying customers' ETFs, Verizon is experimenting with a 30 day upgrade cycle on its Edge plan. However, it's not a free lunch – there is some fine print to contend with. </p>
<p> Verizon Edge is similar to all the early upgrade programs introduced in the last year like Jump (Tmo) and Next (AT&T). </p>
<p> Those of us who've managed to hang on to Verizon unlimited data after the tiered plans started showing up are not going to give it up lightly. We buy unsubsidized phones at ridiculous prices to stay secure in the knowledge that we can gobble as many gigabytes as we want for $30 a month. This does not please Verizon: unlimited data is not conducive to profits, and unsubsidized customers are more likely to bolt. </p>
<p> At this point, we've all heard of T-Mobile's JUMP! program, designed to let customers upgrade smartphones up to twice-yearly. And not to be outdone by T-Mo, AT&T announced its variant of the plan, dubbed Next. Of course, Verizon has its own thing going on, too – Edge. Up to this point, we've only seen leaks that allude to Edge's existence, but Big Red finally took the wraps off and made it official this morning. </p>
<p> Late last night, AT&T began promoting its new "Next" smartphone upgrade plan in earnest. And earlier yesterday, a leaked training document revealed Verizon's "Edge" upgrade plan. Both are very obvious four-letter copies of T-Mobile's new Jump plan. Let me give you the breakdown on these Jump competitors as quickly as I can. </p>
<p> AT&T will allow you to finance (0% interest, no down payment, no finance charges) a phone for 20 months, pay it off monthly, and after 12 months of payments, will let you trade it in and start financing a new phone, and remaining payments on the old phone will be forgiven. </p>

<p> verizon ellipsis </p>
<p> The Verizon Ellipsis 7 is probably not the first choice for tablets among Android Police readers. It's a low-end, whitebox tablet from some no-name OEM that Verizon has rebranded in order to create a product that could sit at the very bottom of its tablet lineup. Even so, those people who did buy an Ellipsis 7 (or got one for free in various packaged promotions) were probably quite happy to see the KitKat update come in a couple of weeks ago.. </p>
<p> We previously provided you with an in-depth, totally true* report on the origins of the Verizon Ellipsis 8, thanks to the efforts of dedicated Android Police writer Michael Crider. It was pretty clear from the hard-hitting coverage, if I may be so bold as to toot our own horn a second time, that this was an overpriced, no-name tablet that nerds and disinterested folks alike would be better off not spending their money on. </p>
<p> If you were one of the four, maybe five people who picked up Verizon's self-branded Ellipsis tablet, then a journey to the settings menu is probably in order. Why? Because Big Red is sending an OTA to the device that brings a handful of useful changes. Here's a look at the changelog: </p>
<p> Image quality when using the camera </p>
<p> Added feature to allow editing of the APN name for Private IP </p>
<p> Option to configure camera to store photos and videos on an external SD card that can be purchased separately. </p>

<p> verizon fascinate </p>
<p> While not nearly as big a deal as the Froyo rollout for the Droid X, Verizon is also releasing an update for the Samsung Fascinate today. Doesn't look like users will receive a notification for the update quite yet, so to get it you'll need to check for it manually. </p>
<p> The changes: </p>
<p> Instant notification of Visual Voice Mail messages on your messaging bar. </p>
<p> Improved syncing between your phone and email accounts. </p>
<p> Planning on picking up the Samsung Fascinate? Might want to take a look at this first: BGR has Verizon's known issues list for the Fascinate in their hot little hands. None of the issues necessarily seem major, but there are quite a few little ones - which can certainly add up. </p>
<p> Many of the issues seem like minor oversights. For example: </p>
<p> Alert notifications can't be changed </p>
<p> Caller ID bug when you're on the line and get a second call </p>
<p> Soft key backlighting isn't tied to screen timeout (it should) </p>
<p> When deleting emails, there's no status bar/window - so it appears the phone is hanging </p>
<p> Downloaded apps are sorted by date downloaded rather than alphabetically </p>
<p> During activation, there's no reboot warning before the phone does so </p>
<p> Another area with a fair number of bugs seems to be email: </p>
<p> Email sync error - sometimes screen goes dark and throws an error </p>
<p> When Exchange security policy is in use, you can't change email password </p>
<p> Lock and Lock screen issues when using Exchange ActiveSync </p>
<p> Corporate email special characters issues </p>
<p> Corporate email inbox error </p>
<p> It's important to remember that phones on all carriers have similar lists, they just generally don't make it public. </p>
<p> Verizon sent out a press release this morning announcing that the Samsung Fascinate we've been hearing so much about lately will, in fact, be dropping on September 9 (as rumored). Even better, it'll be up for sale online tomorrow (September 8\) - meaning you won't be able to get your grubby paws on it until the 9th at the earliest anyway. </p>
<p> As rumored, pricing will be $300 with a $100 mail-in-rebate (MIR), for a final cost of $200. </p>
<p> Not a bad news day for a Friday, eh? Android Central just got an awesome tip (and accompanying blurrycam photo from the Verizon system) which seems to confirm the rumored launch details of the Samsung Fascinate. Namely, the device will be launching 9/9 with new-contract pricing of $200. Better still, it'll be buy-one-get-any (BOGA) - in other words, it looks like you can actually get two Fascinate's for $200. Not a bad deal at all. </p>

<p> Alert notifications can't be changed </p>
<p> Caller ID bug when you're on the line and get a second call </p>
<p> Soft key backlighting isn't tied to screen timeout (it should) </p>
<p> When deleting emails, there's no status bar/window - so it appears the phone is hanging </p>
<p> Downloaded apps are sorted by date downloaded rather than alphabetically </p>
<p> During activation, there's no reboot warning before the phone does so </p>
<p> Another area with a fair number of bugs seems to be email: </p>
<p> Email sync error - sometimes screen goes dark and throws an error </p>
<p> When Exchange security policy is in use, you can't change email password </p>
<p> Lock and Lock screen issues when using Exchange ActiveSync </p>
<p> Corporate email special characters issues </p>
<p> Corporate email inbox error </p>
<p> It's important to remember that phones on all carriers have similar lists, they just generally don't make it public. </p>

<p> UK network BT has just launched a Stadia broadband bundle, and now Verizon is following suit with a similar deal. It has announced that new Fios Gigabit customers will receive Stadia's Premiere Edition for free. This promo stacks on top of the network's existing free one-year Disney Plus offer. </p>
<p> I'm a fairly satisfied Verizon Fios customer with a basic internet and TV package. Sure, it helps that the man who installed our setup somehow gave us a handful of channels we weren't supposed to get (shh), but I've come to prefer it over any of the previous providers I've endured. But one thing I haven't taken advantage of yet is the Verizon FiOS Mobile app, probably because I'm still a bit scarred by visions of the atrocious bloatware defecating all over my phones when I was a Verizon Wireless customer. Well, Verizon has just released a new app for Fios TV customers simply called Fios TV. </p>
<p> Verizon isn't making many friends when it comes to keeping private information private. Just two days after news broke that Verizon Wireless is collecting and in some cases selling web browsing info, its parent company has been given a black eye for insecure practices associated with the FiOS Internet service. Security researcher Randy Westergren discovered a way to access any FiOS user's Verizon email account by using the mobile API. </p>
<p> The message is, "You really shouldn't be using this app. Or the free email we gave you. At all." </p>
<p> Westergren's discovery and his explanation are highly technical, but what it boils down to is that he could substitute the username (and only the username) of a Verizon FIOS email user in a particular API script in order to access that account. </p>

<p> verizon galaxy camera </p>
<p> If you happened to be one of the less than 13 people who shelled out $550 to get Verizon's variant of the Galaxy Camera, then a nice update is heading your way. It appears to bring some pretty useful new features, like S Memo, a new Help App, four new Smart Modes, and a nifty remote view finder. </p>
<p> So far as the new Smart Modes are concerned, the update brings scenes for dawn, indoor parties, snow, and food to the device, for a total of 19. </p>
<p> After our review, the Galaxy Camera may not be high on your wishlist this holiday season, but if you're set on Samsung's smartphone-meet-camera mashup, and AT&T's HSPA+ version isn't quick enough for your fast-paced shutterbug lifestyle, you may be in luck: it looks like the Verizon Galaxy Camera is for real. </p>
<p> A Samsung product page appears to have inadvertently gone live for the device (model EK-GC120), boasting Verizon's 4G LTE connectivity, along with everything else the standard Galaxy Camera does. </p>

<p> It's been a long, long time coming, but the official Android 4.2 update for the Verizon Galaxy Nexus is here. The black sheep of the Nexus family has waited for four months to get updated to the latest release, and while Verizon is currently testing the software for a probable release later this week or month, you don't have to wait that long. Long-time Android tipster WinDroidGuy got his hot hands on the update ZIP package, and eager users can download it right now. </p>
<p> Google has just published the fully flashable image for the 4.0.4 update to the Verizon Galaxy Nexus (mysid). This allows users who either have been unable to receive the OTA due to using a custom ROM, or simply haven't updated, to flash their devices with a complete OS image, as opposed to using an incremental update file. </p>
<p> This will erase all of your data, so if you do flash it, be sure to back up your stuff. </p>

<p> verizon galaxy note ii </p>
<p> Hey Verizon customers - I bet you've been jealous watching all the Note II action on other carriers, haven't you? We've seen the releases come, and Amazon Wireless slash prices for basically all versions of the device. Still, everyone on Verizon was left wanting. Good news! Big Red just announced that the Note II will be available beginning tomorrow, November 29th for $300 with a two-year agreement. </p>
<p> So, if you can handle the obtrusive branding on the home button and are willing to dedicate two more years of your mobile life to VZW, you can stroll right into a Verizon retail store and walk out with your very own Note II first thing tomorrow. </p>
<p> BriefMobile has received a screenshot this morning that would seem to confirm the existence of a Verizon-flavored Galaxy Note II, rounding out the phone's appearances on each of the US's "big four" carriers. </p>
<p> Last week, we saw the device leaked for T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&T. We had figured, at that point, that Verizon wouldn't be getting the device. Particularly because it's selling the LG Intuition, which is the Note II's one and only phablet (shudder) competitor here in the US. </p>

<p> verizon galaxy tab </p>
<p> This morning, Verizon announced that Samsung's Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 has been infused with LTE, and that the mobile data-fied cheap-slate will be available on August 17th for a rather appealing $350. The Tab 2 may not be our favorite 7" Android tablet anymore (hey, who can blame us?), but when Eric reviewed it back in April, he found it to be a highly capable little device. And that's surprising, because he hates things with stupid names. </p>
<p> Well it isn't exactly unexpected, but the Boy Genius Report claims to have multiple sources inside Verizon Wireless who not only sent them the above image, but also were able to confirm that Samsung will announce more about this particular 7-inch tablet at its September 16 media event. </p>
<p> Additionally, Engadget decided to join the internal screenshot party and provide an image of their own, which is essentially the same, only a lot sharper and inserted below. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab is really shaping up to one awesome tablet, and if this latest rumor from the Wall Street Journal turns out to be true, a lot of people will be able to experience it for themselves. </p>
<p> Apparently, "three people familiar with the matter" told WSJ that Samsung already has deals with Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T that involve a certain 7-inch tablet - deals similar to the ones made for the Galaxy S line of phones. </p>

<p> Compared to the earlier days of the internet, Yahoo isn't the most known or well-liked company around anymore. It's not even an independent business any longer, as it was bought by Verizon in 2017. That might be why it has decided it's time to create a mobile phone plan, which could help make it feel relevant again. The company is gearing up to launch Yahoo Mobile, a virtual network that relies on Verizon's infrastructure and gives you unlimited 4G data, texts, and calls for $40 a month. The website is currently only accessible via its URL; Google Search won't find it yet. </p>
<p> Comcast is one of the largest internet service providers in the United States, but unlike some of its competitors (such as AT&T), it didn't have a wireless network - until today. In a surprise announcement, Comcast has revealed Xfinity Mobile. </p>

<p> verizon one max </p>
<p> Verizon just released its variant of the HTC One Max for a cool three-hundred dollar bill this morning, but Wirefly clearly thought that was just too much, so it knocked a full 50 percent off that. Yeah, you can get the One Max for $150. Of course, that requires a new two-year agreement, but it looks like it's working for both new contracts and upgrades. That's hard to beat. </p>
<p> At this point, we're thinking this could be an error on someone's part, because that's a hell of a deal on a brand-spankin'-new handset, especially one like the One Max. </p>
<p> If you like massive phones, fingerprint scanners, HTC, and Verizon, today might just be the luckiest day of your life. Why is that, you ask? I'll tell you why! Because the massive HTC One Max is now available on Big Red. See, dreams really do come true. </p>
<p> But let's say you're not the huge-phone-fingerprint-scanner-HTC-Verizon-loving type. Let's say you have no idea what the One Max is. No problem, let's just clear that up right now. </p>

<p> A massive outage affecting T-Mobile's network has resolved overnight, with President of Technology Neville Ray claiming that service was finally fully restored around 1AM ET, following almost a day of widespread issues. Though reports came in for issues on all three big US carriers, AT&T and Verizon claim their networks were operating as usual. </p>
<p> Verizon's network appears to be experiencing a major service outage centered around Florida. It seems the outage mostly affects calling, not necessarily data or texting. More as we receive it (update: Verizon statement below) - but Down Detector makes it clear something is up. It is not known if any other regions are affected by the outage at this time. </p>

<p> verizon plans </p>
<p> Verizon was in the news earlier this week when the company announced it was buying Tracfone for around $6.25 billion in cash and stocks. Now big red has taken the lid off a few more newsworthy items: the company is adding a new connected device plan and simplifying plan options for smartwatches. </p>
<p> Verizon is making several changes to its Mix & Match unlimited plans that appear to be mostly for the better. Two of the plans are getting what the company calls "The Disney Bundle," which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. Others, however, are getting their Disney+ trials shortened from one year to six months. There are a couple of other minor tweaks as well. </p>
<p> Verizon announced not a second, but its third "unlimited" smartphone plan yesterday, and it goes to show just how meaningless the term has become in the US wireless industry. Verizon's new "above" unlimited plan (the tiers are "go," "beyond," and "above" for those of you playing aspirational-marketing-nonsense-vocabulary at home) is basically America's Most Red Carrier deciding it can cash in on heavy data users to the tune of an extra ten bucks, making it $95 a month. </p>
<p> The "above" plan raises the unlimited (but obviously not unlimited) data cap to 75GB from 22GB, the mobile hotspot allowance to 20GB from 15GB, and tosses in five "TravelPass" roaming days per month. </p>

<p> The second-generation Galaxy J7 V hit shelves a little over a year ago. Three months later, even though Pie had already been officially released, it received the 8.0 Oreo update. It's taken until now for both the J7 V and its prepaid J7 counterpart to be updated to the latest Android 9 Pie. </p>
<p> After the new post-paid plans announced by Verizon earlier in the month, it seemed like only a matter of time before changes would reach their prepaid plans as well. Well, that time has come. Verizon has updated its prepaid plans, and taking inspiration from the ‘Safe Mode’ throttling available in its post-paid plans, included "Always-On" throttled data at no extra cost. </p>
<p> Perhaps unlike the revisions made to the post-paid offerings, the changes made to Verizon’s prepaid plans are actually a solid upgrade. The main feature to be added to Verizon’s prepaid offerings, last revised in May, is the inclusion of ‘Always-On’ data throttling when prepaid data limits have been reached. Like </p>

<p> verizon sim lock </p>
<p> According to CNET, Verizon Wireless will begin SIM-locking its smartphones out of the box at some point this spring. Essentially no details are provided about how this will be implemented, but it really doesn't matter, because Verizon rather explicitly agreed not to do this ten years ago. </p>
<p> Per the restrictions imposed by the 700MHz Upper Block C spectrum auction it won in 2008, Verizon is expressly barred from locking down handsets on its network that utilize this spectrum. The plain text from the restrictions makes this absolutely clear. </p>
<p> (e)Handset locking prohibited. No licensee may disable features on handsets it provides to customers, to the extent such features are compliant with the licensee's standards pursuant to paragraph (b)of this section, nor configure handsets it provides to prohibit use of such handsets on other providers' networks. </p>

<p> Unlimited smartphone data is back! Roll out the barrels, re-download Netflix, and disable all those "Wi-Fi only" settings options, happy days are here again. But don't throw away your data meter just yet: the new batch of unlimited data plans from American carriers isn't what it used to be. A lack of limits now comes with an asterisk, like your favorite sports star "enhancing" his performance. So the question is no longer, "which mobile unlimited plan is the best?" </p>
<p> Have an unlimited data plan on Verizon? Well, it's about to get more expensive. While the company hasn't actually offered unlimited smartphone data to new customers since around 2011, many subscribers are still "grandfathered" into old unlimited data plans. Verizon has already tried to push such subscribers to the new tiered plans, and being grandfathered now generally necessitates buying your phones off-contract if you want to stay on the gigabyte gravy train. </p>

<p> We had a pretty good idea it was coming, and now it's here: Verizon has started rollout of the Android 2.2 update for the Droid X. As usual, some users are already receiving notification that an update is available, but if you don't want to wait, you can always check for the update manually. </p>
<p> Obviously, the most major change comes from updating Android itself. However, it looks like Verizon has also made a few other tweaks while it was at it. </p>
<p> No product is perfect - especially when it launches. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that software updates are often pushed out shortly after release so as to eliminate bugs, incompatibilities, and increase speed. </p>
<p> It appears that's exactly what Verizon's doing today, for software version.2.2.20.A955.Verizon.en.US/BP: BP_C_01.09.05P for the Droid 2 is now rolling out, OTA style. It isn't a major revision, but it does include a number of enhancements, including: </p>
<p> Streamlined setup of Visual Voice Mail </p>
<p> Improved contact syncing with Corporate Exchange </p>
<p> More accurate contact pictures in the recent call log </p>

<p> Android N (Nutella? Nougat?) is edging closer and closer to an official stable release, but that doesn't mean 6.0 Marshmallow is anywhere close to saturation point: according to Android's official monthly distribution numbers, only 10.1% of Android users are using that latest stable version of the OS. That should increase a little bit more in the next week or two, with Verizon announcing the Marshmallow update for its Galaxy Note Edge is ready. </p>
<p> The update brings all the things you would expect of a Marshmallow-based upgrade. Now on Tap is here (which is getting better all the time), as are on-demand permissions and Doze, saving you crucial battery life. </p>
<p> According to both Verizon and HTC's Mo Versi, owners of the HTC 10 will receive an OTA update starting on Friday. As seems to be tradition for HTC flagships, the early months are characterized by a flurry of camera refinements and this round seems no different. </p>
<p> Getting a software update from Verizon is usually a real treat, since Big Red isn't normally too fond of pushing them out. Well, Verizon Galaxy S5 owners, this is one of your special days. Before getting too excited, though, there isn't much to this one. </p>
<p> Weren't you dying to get GALAXY Apps on your S5? No? Too bad, here it is. This is the rebranded version of Samsung Apps, so newer is probably better, even if many users would prefer neither. GALAXY Apps should have a far wider selection than its predecessor. </p>
<p> A more meaningful update is that the fingerprint scanner can now be used to unlock your phone when you have a Microsoft Exchange account acting as a device administrator. </p>

<p> Verizon's much-delayed Voice over LTE network finally got a slightly more concrete release date today, with America's largest wireless provider announcing the rollout will commence in a matter of "months." Verizon, unlike AT&T, also plans to make the national rollout of VoLTE simultaneous, rather than scaling up from test markets over time. Given this fact, it's sort of understandable Verizon's efforts have been considerably slower than some of its rivals when it comes to HD voice. </p>
<p> On an investor call earlier this morning, Verizon Wireless CFO Fran Shammo said that the carrier's buildout of its 4G LTE network will be completed by mid-2013. This is after an earlier estimate of the end of 2013, putting the company a full six months ahead of schedule. </p>
<p> Now, network news isn't really very exciting. And what I just wrote up there is pretty boring. But, this is important stuff. Verizon is quite literally years ahead of its competitors if this turns out to be true. </p>

<p> As we settle into mid-2020, 5G has soundly made its presence felt in markets stretching all across the US. What started off as extremely patchy deployment has been getting better, fast, as carriers both bring 5G support to new regions and switch on new frequencies to improve the quality of coverage. But the rapidly changing shape of the 5G landscape has also made it really annoying to keep of what kind of connectivity you can expect from what carriers, where. That's why we're taking a look at the availability of 5G in the US: where it is now, where it's coming next, and how to get it. </p>
<p> Verizon is one of the biggest names in the game when it comes to wireless in the US. The company recently launched new options for prepaid plans, and just released its own credit card as well. Recently the carrier announced plans for some new student discounts, and today those deals are going live. </p>

<p> Motorola was at the forefront of cell phones for decades, but it never quite found its footing in the smartphone era. Early hits like the original Droid and Droid X bring nostalgia, but are also a brutal reminder: Motorola hasn't really made a standout smartphone in almost a decade, unless you count budget phones like the Moto X and G series. Cut to 2020—it's been several years since Motorola even made a flagship phone, and after the disaster that were Moto Mods, it's taking a real risk with the 5G-equipped, Verizon-exclusive Edge+. </p>

<p> If you're a Verizon customer hoping to bring a shiny new OnePlus 8 Pro onto America's biggest, reddest network, you finally can. After OnePlus told us that it could take until June for unlocked OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro phones to get onto Verizon, the carrier today certified both devices to use its towers. </p>
<p> You may have missed it, but OnePlus announced its new 8 series earlier this month. They're the company's best and most expensive phones yet, transitioning OnePlus away from its former "flagship killer" model to compete more directly with the likes of Samsung. The OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro are available to purchase today, starting at $699. </p>

<p> Cellular carriers have earned many negative impressions over the years for poor billing practices, unfair contracts, and some dubious attempts to insert themselves where they might not belong; but there's no denying that they have a good track record for giving a little back in times of crisis. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, carriers in the U.S. have committed to not terminate customers' lines and provide more data and cheaper plans to those who need them. </p>

<p> LG's got a new design language in the works — a fresh take on its phones that's supposed to usher the company into this decade with a clean look and some updated thinking towards flagship hardware. But before we turn the page to that next chapter, we've still got its first big 2020 launch to check out, the 5G-equipped, Dual Screen, 865-packing LG V60 ThinQ. </p>
<p> Motorola has slowly dropped out of the flagship phone race in recent years, but it's coming roaring back in 2020 with the Edge+. It's got all the latest hardware including a Snapdragon 865, millimeter wave 5G, and a gaggle of camera sensors. It also has the curviest curved OLED panel you've ever seen. You'll only be able to see it on Verizon, though. Motorola has a cheaper version of this device called simply the Motorola Edge, but we know much less about its release plans here. </p>
<p> First was T-Mobile in 2018. Then came Sprint last year. Now, Verizon is carrying its first OnePlus phone for sale. The OnePlus 8 5G UW — yep, that's the name Big Red's going with — will be available to buy from April 29 for $800. But unlike any other model of OnePlus 8, this one will be the only one to support millimeter wave 5G. </p>

<p> As much as we like it, there's no escaping the fact that the $800-plus Pixel 3 is pricey. Bundles can help take the sting out of that sticker shock, though, especially when the freebie is a high-quality product. Right now, Best Buy is including just such a quality item: the Nest Cam is free with any Pixel 3 or 3 XL purchased and activated on Verizon. </p>
<p> As Android P approaches, some users of newer devices still waiting for Oreo are becoming increasingly frustrated. But LG G6 owners on Verizon Wireless are getting some relief: Android 8.0 is rolling out to the device now. </p>
<p> Are you looking to get in on some of the 4G action that's going around nowadays? If you've been holding off in search of a cheaper deal, then you may want to take a look at this latest offer for the HTC Thunderbolt from Wirefly. </p>
<p> If you purchase the Thunderbolt with a new Verizon account, you can get a taste of the carrier's first 4G device for just $59.99 - almost half the price of the previous deal we saw a couple of weeks ago. Despite the fact that the Thunderbolt still runs Froyo, this is a great deal for those of you yet to buy in to 4G handsets. </p>

<p> In the slowly unraveling drama that is the XOOM 4G LTE upgrade, another chapter has been put in place. Rumor has it that VZW XOOM owners may receive an email today letting them know the the upgrade will happen in September -- but we have no confirmation as of yet. </p>
<p> Update: Here is the email we received confirming that the update should indeed start in September: </p>
<p> The original word on the street was that the upgrade should have happened only three months after launch, a deadline severely missed by Motorola/Verizon. </p>
<p> When Google announced its highly anticipated Music beta service at I/O last week, we were told that, aside from I/O attendees, Verizon XOOM owners would be among the first to get to use the service. Holding true to that, Google has officially started sending out the invites this morning. </p>
<p> As far as we know, this is exclusive to Verizon customers right now, with no word when owners of other models (or other devices) can expect to get the invite (aside from attendees with their Galaxy Tab 10.1's). </p>
<p> Yesterday at Google I/O, The Goog announced the next version of Honeycomb (Android 3.1), and said that the first tablet to see the update would be the Verizon version of the Motorola XOOM. Motorola followed up that announcement with an official statement today, including when the other XOOM variants could expect to see to get some updated Honeycomb action. </p>
<p> XOOM owners will be able to enjoy some nice improvements with this update, including support for the new Movies feature in the Android Market, resizable widgets, full support for the newest version of Adobe Flash player (10.2), which brings drastic improvements to performance and stability; and support for USB peripherals like game controllers, keyboards, and mice. </p>

<p> verizon z4v </p>
<p> Remember the Verizon Z4v? Me neither [almost]! I even wrote an article about this phone like 2 weeks ago and I still barely remember it. If you want a refresher: the Z4v was basically a Verizon-ified version of the Xperia Z4. Which launched way back in April. There's also that whole "the Z5 now exists" thing, which makes releasing a new Z4 variant kind of pointless and generally a bit silly. </p>
<p> Verizon, in what can only be called a mildly astonishing moment of self-realization and pragmatism, has therefore decided to cancel the phone. Take it away, Albert: </p>
<p> Verizon will no longer be launching Xperia Z4v, however we are committed to supporting Sony Mobile’s product portfolio and will support existing products. </p>
<p> Remember that time Verizon announced it will carry a version of the Xperia Z4 called the Xperia Z4v three months ago? And said it would be out "this summer?" Well, summer ends in exactly... tomorrow, and the phone still isn't out. It was actually allegedly supposed to be released over a month ago, but now any kind of launch before October seems highly unlikely. Some guy got one anyway (somehow) and reviewed it in this video on YouTube. Verizon's site, by the way, says the phone is still "coming soon." </p>
<p> As I hope we can all agree, this is tremendously, mind-bendingly dumb for several reasons. </p>

<p> versa </p>
<p> The Versa 2 smartwatch is one of Fitbit's best products and offers a good compromise between looks and fitness features. It usually sells for about $200, but you can now get it for just $130, thanks to this markdown. </p>
<p> Over the last few years, Fitbit has become synonymous with fitness tracking. While its earlier products tended to be simpler devices that focused on step tracking, the company has transitioned to more intricate wearables that combine best-in-class fitness tracking with the features and form-factor of a standard smartwatch. At the moment, you can pick up a Fitbit Versa for $120 at Amazon, saving $50 off the list price. </p>
<p> In time for the holiday season, Fitbit is updating a whole bunch of software and services in the hopes of getting everyone excited and resolved for a healthier 2020 — just as it hopes Google ownership will improve its stance in the fitness tech marketplace. Fitbit OS 4.1 will be rolling out some features originally exclusive to the Versa 2 to other smartwatches while Fitbit Premium will be adopting more special routines to inspire some better habits. </p>
<p> Fitbit has been around long before smartwatches became a thing and is synonymous with fitness trackers to this day. However, the company isn't shy about its smartwatch ambitions and has already released some devices in this category, including the Ionic and the Versa. The manufacturer is building on this foundation and plans to release a new model of the latter. Renders already showed us what the Versa 2 should look like, and now, further leaks courtesy of TizenHelp and HRDLPN have surfaced, presenting the device and its packaging in full glory. TizenHelp claims it will hit shelves September 15. </p>
<p> Fitbit was huge in fitness trackers before the smartwatch fad, so it was a natural evolution for the company to add a few more features and launch a smartwatch. It started with the Ionic and then released the Versa, which was a better watch. Our friend Evan "evleaks" Blass has images of the upcoming Versa 2, and it has at least one major surprise: a real voice assistant. </p>
<p> Summer is here, so you might want to enjoy the sunny outdoors by walking, running, or swimming. If you're looking for a companion to track your workouts, you're in luck, as various Fitbit trackers are currently on sale on Amazon, with discounts reaching up to $80 off. </p>
<p> Fitbit launched the Versa in March last year, and it was a better product than the company's first smartwatch. While it had a bit of an Apple Watch vibe, the Versa was a capable fitness-oriented smartwatch. We have yet to see a followup to Fitbit's first watch (the Ionic), but it looks like a Versa successor is nearing release. A new leak shows off the watch in four snazzy colors. </p>
<p> Android Auto is available on over 500 new cars and head units these days, and the list of supported vehicles is constantly growing. Building on the six 2018 Nissan models that Android Auto support was added for last year, another six 2019 model-year Nissans have been added, including some of the brand's most popular nameplates. </p>
<p> Fitbit's smartwatch efforts got off to a slow start with the Ionic, but that device has gotten much better with updates. Meanwhile, the Versa launched with a more understated design and a lower price tag. Today, Fitbit is rolling out more improvements to its smartwatch platform with the new v3.0 update. FitbitOS 3.0 adds more stats in the Today dashboard, some new fitness-oriented app tie-ins, and additional exercise goals. </p>
<p> It's a rough time to be interested in wearables to pair with your Android phone. The updated Qualcomm Wear 3100 is still slow to appear in Wear OS devices, and Samsung's Tizen watches are very expensive with poor app support. Then there's Fitbit. These fitness-oriented smartwatches don't have as many features as the others, but they get much better battery life. You pay a bit for the name, but Best Buy has both Fitbit smartwatches discounted right now. </p>

<p> Google has been making a big deal about its Assistant for a long time now, going so far as to call it "your own personal Google." It's made it onto phones, Chromebooks, and smart speakers, but it's never been available on a third-party smartwatch — until now! According to code found in the latest version of the Fitbit Android app, the company is working on adding integration with the Google Assistant. </p>

<p> Fitbit's grown from basic fitness tracking to move into smartwatches with models like the ill-fated Ionic and its much-improved successor, the Versa.

<p> Confirming an earlier teardown and statements from Fitbit around launch time, Google is continuing to assure us that Assistant is coming to recent Fitbit wearables "this winter." Fitbit's latest Sense and Versa 3 will be both be supported, bringing the convenience of Google's hands-free smart digital assistant to your wrist without the overhead of Wear OS. </p>
<p> After a recent leak spoiled the surprise, Fitbit has just announced its three big new products for 2020. The headline product comes in the form of the brand-new Fitbit Sense, the company's most advanced health-tracking smartwatch to date. At the same time, both the Versa and Inspire series get iterative updates that add enough new features to make them worth considering. </p>
<p> Google’s plan to acquire Fitbit has come under fire for the potential misuse of users’ health data, stalling the deal announced in November. In the meantime, Fitbit is continuing to work on its smartwatch range, and we could see some new product launches pretty soon. A WinFuture report details that Fitbit will add a new high-end timepiece named Sense to its lineup, along with new iterations of the Versa and Inspire series. </p>

<p> After a couple of months of speculation, the new Fitbit Versa has landed and it is indeed a Lite version of the original. But it's not the only tracker the company is announcing today. Joining it is an updated Ace 2 for kids as well as a new Inspire and Inspire HR that aim to replace the Alta line-up but also merge some features from the older Fitbit Zip and One. Fitbit also announced an upcoming update to its app as well as a new rewards program. </p>

<p> version </p>
<p> Say Google, is there something big you're hiding in the latest version of the YouTube Android app that justifies a massive jump in the version number? Because if you are, we can't find it. The YouTube app currently propagating across the Play Store is version 10.02.3, a huge jump from the previous (and not altogether different) 6.0.3. The newer version adds a grid-based share menu and a few changed icons and brings back the voice search option, plus a few changes under the hood, but it's a very strange jump for a comparatively small update. </p>
<p> Google's burgeoning live how-to service, Helpouts, got a brand new version of its Android app yesterday, bringing it up to version 1.3. The service, for those unaware, pairs those who know how to do things with those who do not know how to do things, connecting the two over video. Those doing the helping can charge or offer their insight for free. </p>
<p> At any rate, the updated app offers users improved Helpouts listings, the ability to share Helpouts, refer friends, and manage referrals. </p>
<p> Sprint has posted the details regarding an impending OTA for the Galaxy Tab 3. This software update won't turn the tablet into a brand new device, nor will it even bring along much in the way of fresh air, but it's better than nothing. Software version T217SVPUANB8 will improve WiFi, install KNOX, and make the WiFi "auto network switch" default to off. That last one's pretty specific, but Sprint says it will ultimately enable users to connect to any WiFi network regardless of its strength by suppressing the "Your internet connection is unstable" error message. </p>
<p> It's that time again - each month, Google updates the developer dashboard to reflect Android's latest platform distribution numbers, determined according to devices that have accessed the Play Store in a seven-day period. </p>
<p> Last month, we saw KitKat make a small leap to 1.4% - it's made another tiny gain, rising to 1.8% of devices, while Jelly Bean has gone from 59.1% up to 60.7%. Gingerbread meanwhile continues its death march, letting 1.2% slip through its icy grasp, falling to an even 20% of devices. </p>
<p> While Instagram is busy rolling out its own "beautiful" (also "gorgeous") video functionality, the folks at Vine are busy making good on the "rapid, significant updates" they promised for this summer, releasing version 1.1 of the service's Android app today. </p>
<p> Responding directly to users' feedback, Vine now includes a "clear cache" option inside the app's settings. Previously, users complained that the app's cache ate up staggering amounts of space. </p>
<p> For those unfamiliar, the BBC iPlayer allows our friends in the United Kingdom to watch live BBC programming on the go. Featured shows and up to seven days of previous content are also available for streaming. The application is incompatible with international devices, so don't bother paying the Play Store a visit if London is more than a couple hundred miles away from where you live. And the latest update to the app ushers in support for 1080p displays, allowing it to take advantage of the latest-gen handsets. </p>
<p> Amazon's Kindle app has just received a significant update, bringing the reader up to version 4 and introducing a refreshed UI, among other things. </p>
<p> Just when I'd decided to try switching to Play Books (despite giving up things like quick two-finger brightness adjustment), Amazon has introduced a redesigned library that's much more lively than a simple grid of book covers. The new library interface has your books plus a nice "carousel" up top for recent items. </p>
<p> Yesterday, we finally decided to get to the bottom of Google Keep's new font, Roboto Slab. Shortly before that, however, we had an internal discussion about Keep's strange UI/UX. The app is beautiful – there's no denying that – but weird when considered alongside Google's other in-house apps. What's more, I'm of the opinion that the app isn't just a one-off in terms of design – I think that Keep, along with a few other hints, could give us some insight into what we'll see in the next version of Android (which we might see in May at Google I/O). </p>
<p> Roman Nurik's DashClock Widget has seen remarkable adoption since its release earlier this month, with a handful of apps quickly adding their own DashClock extensions in a bid to populate your lock screen with useful information. Joining the list today is PushBullet which, in an update to version 9, added a DashClock extension that will let you know how many pushes await you before you unlock your device. </p>
<p> Besides the DashClock extension, PushBullet will now play your device's default notification tone when you receive a push, and has new localization for Italian and Dutch users, along with a couple of other tweaks. </p>
<p> PushBullet, the dynamic, practical push notification app we included in our top five roundup yesterday got a nice update today. The update brings the app to version 8 and introduces a feature that makes it even more awesome – the ability to push to others' devices or have them push to your own. </p>
<p> You might be wondering why this is such an awesome feature. Well, today's post to the PushBullet blog explains that with a few examples: users can push each other the address to a new restaurant, a quick grocery list update, a cheerful image, or use sharing to "Rickroll your friends in a new and exciting way." </p>

<p> No product is perfect - especially when it launches. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that software updates are often pushed out shortly after release so as to eliminate bugs, incompatibilities, and increase speed. </p>
<p> It appears that's exactly what Verizon's doing today, for software version.2.2.20.A955.Verizon.en.US/BP: BP_C_01.09.05P for the Droid 2 is now rolling out, OTA style. It isn't a major revision, but it does include a number of enhancements, including: </p>
<p> Streamlined setup of Visual Voice Mail </p>

<p> version 3.0 </p>
<p> Let's face it: productivity suites like Microsoft Office or the cloud-based Google Docs aren't exactly exciting, but they are among the most vital applications for the businessmen in us. Whether this remains true when 2.8-4.3-inch displays are concerned is debatable, but if you ask DataViz, the company that developed the free Documents To Go app, the answer is a resounding "yes." </p>
<p> The company has just released a brand new version 3.0 of its uber-popular app, which includes numerous improvements, namely: </p>
<p> a "totally redesigned" UI (not so sure that's for the better, though; all I'm seeing right now is a bunch of ugly blue menus) </p>
<p> an enhanced file browser </p>
<p> Google Docs support (the one thing that had always been missing for me) </p>
<p> an improved PDF viewer that now includes various zooming options (pinch-to-zoom and double-tap-to-zoom), keypad shortcuts, hyperlinks, the ability to rotate a page, render multiple pages, and more </p>
<p> an "optimized" version of Slideshow To Go </p>
<p> support for password-protected Office 2003 & 2007 docs as well as support for Microsoft Office 2010 files </p>
<p> The free version of the app doesn't allow you to edit or create files but can be used for reading them. </p>

<p> Maybe you weren't waiting up til 4am EST, eagerly anticipating the release of Angry Birds Space. That is what you have us for, after all. If you were, though, you might remember that only one version of the app made it to the Play Store that night: the free version. Later, though, Rovio released "Angry Birds Space Premium," which is the ad-free version of the app. Now, Rovio has released Angry Birds Space HD. </p>
<p> Those who have been waiting for ARCHOS' 1.5GHz variants of the G9 series of tablets are in luck – both tablets' "turbo versions" are now shipping from the manufacturer's web store. </p>
<p> For those who may not be familiar with ARCHOS' G9 series of tablets, here are the specs: </p>
<p> 1024x768 8" or 1280x800 10.1" display </p>
<p> OMAP 4 dual-core processor at 1.5GHz </p>
<p> 8GB flash memory or 250GB HDD (plus a microSD slot) </p>
<p> 1GB RAM </p>
<p> 720p front-facing camera </p>
<p> 1080p video playback </p>
<p> MicroUSB and Mini HDMI ports </p>
<p> With base prices of just $269 and $329 respectively, both G9 tablets make affordable, yet powerful options for those looking to get an Android-powered tablet. </p>
<p> Oh, Android. How far you've come since the days of the G1. Actually, tomorrow, October 22nd, will mark 3 years to the day that Android has been available on consumer handsets in the United States, and the G1 on T-Mobile was concepción. </p>
<p> With Ice Cream Sandwich finally revealed, Android has gone through its seventh major iteration. How has Android changed? What better way to illustrate Android's evolution than its home screen, the hub of user interaction. </p>
<p> As announced back at Google I/O, Android developers now have the ability to upload multiple APKs (individual package files) under the same listing in the Android Market. When you download an application that has multiple APKs associated with it, the Market will intelligently pick the APK that is most compatible with your device. </p>
<p> This gives developers an alternate method of supporting a wide variety of devices (say, phones and tablets) without stuffing complicated logic and graphical assets into a single APK. </p>
<p> Late last night, the Android team pushed out a set of changes to the Android app publishing interface that developers use to upload and maintain their apps. The new features, while completely invisible to the end-users, are absolutely fascinating to app developers. </p>
<p> Each app now has a Statistics link, which consists of the following: </p>
<p> a Google Finance-style Flash chart of all installs, the time period for which you can adjust as you see fit </p>
<p> Android versions (conveniently placed side-by-side with the same stats for all apps in the Market) </p>
<p> specific device models </p>
<p> countries where your app is downloaded from (also side-by-side with countries for all apps in the Market) </p>
<p> languages used on the phones with your app on them (also compared to the global stats) </p>
<p> Have a look at some screenshots, then, if you are a developer, hurry to your own publishing console and check out those sexy stats for yourself. </p>
<p> If you love devouring Android stats, Google's Android Platform Versions sub-site, which is updated about once a month, just got refreshed with the latest batch of data. Last month, Froyo ate up some 36% of the pie, while Éclair was found to be running on about 41% of devices, with the remaining 23% being taken up by Cupcake and Donut. </p>
<p> As you can see for yourself in the graph above, this month was quite a turn-around - Froyo (at 43.4%) finally stole the throne from Éclair, which was left with 39.6%. </p>

<p> Anyone who's used Google search recently will know how many different cards that have been implemented as of late. Google is now taking this a step further by including automatically generated expandable tabs that elaborate on different aspects of searches with comparisons, such as "quartz vs granite." </p>
<p> In Android Police's latest video, we take you on a comparative journey or, as it is known in the YouTube parlance, a versus. The Galaxy S7 may be a smaller, more expensive phone than the OnePlus 3, that much is true. But if you're in the unlocked device market, the S7's frequent discounting could mean you're actually cross-shopping these devices. Or maybe you're just not sure if you want to get back on a carrier contract or payment plan, and want to see if the no-strings-attached model of the OnePlus 3 could sway you to pay that MSRP up front. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/vertical-video/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549216" filename="vertical-video">
<p> Most of the professionally produced video you watch is filmed for a TV or movie screen—it's landscape. That makes sense, of course, because most screens don't rotate to portrait mode, that new Samsung spinning TV notwithstanding. However, your phone does rotate, and a new streaming service called Quibi wants to take advantage of that. Quibi will offer premium video content that you can watch in either portrait or landscape, and you can switch back and forth whenever you want. </p>
<p> While you can use smartphones in horizontal orientations, apps like Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and others highly encourage vertical video formats. As such, content creators and regular folks shooting horizontally have to crop their clips to fit these social media platforms — a tedious process. Adobe and other companies have been working on automating this process for years, but now Google is also entering the intelligent auto-cropping game with its open-source AutoFlip framework. </p>
<p> Everyone loves vertical video, right? Well, we've got good news for you; Instagram has unveiled IGTV, a new video app with longer content exclusively in the beloved vertical format. Additionally, the company has just reached one billion users, which is no small feat. </p>
<p> A teardown of Google Maps v.9.58 turned up some signs that video contributions would become a feature in the very near future. If you're registered as a Local Guide, that time has come. Or at least it's coming, this seems to have only just started rolling out to members of the program today. It doesn't seem as though the videos are actually visible from the detail views yet, but that will probably come soon enough. </p>
<p> A post on the Local Guides Connect forum details the basic process as it invites members to begin submitting footage. Videos can be shot from within Google Maps, but they are limited to a length of just 10 seconds. </p>
<p> Vertical videos are terrible for many reasons, but we may have to come to terms with the fact that people just won't stop recording videos vertically. This inescapable foible of humanity is made slightly less galling by a new feature in YouTube 10.28 (which you can grab from APK Mirror). Vertical videos are now displayed properly (i.e. vertically) when made full screen - something we didn't quite notice until today. </p>

<p> vertu </p>
<p> British luxury smartphone maker Vertu has been dealing with financial woes as of late, but it looked like the company might be able to pull out of its death spiral following an acquisition by Turkish businessman Murat Hakan Uzan. Vertu's new owner has apparently realized how hard it is to sell phones that cost tens of thousands of dollars. After trying and failing to settle the company's debts, Uzan is throwing in the towel. Vertu is closing up shop. </p>
<p> For anyone who understandably hasn't heard of it, Vertu is the previously Nokia-owned luxury smartphone maker that tries to convince celebrities and the super rich to shell out up to $50,000 on extravagant devices made from materials such as sapphire and platinum. Vertu phones have tended to be ugly and underpowered, and its business model seems to rely on the adage that wealthy people love to decorate themselves with expensive, superficial accessories. It would appear that even those with money to burn still prioritize a decent smartphone experience, however, and Vertu may be finding that out the hard way. </p>
<p> Vertu's super-premium phones have always been a curiosity on the internet. They occupy a very odd little niche with their distinctive, angular design and luxury materials, but they've also been woefully behind in the spec department. Vertu's latest phone, the $9,000-19,000 Signature Touch, has much more respectable internals. It's still stupidly expensive, though. </p>

<p> vessel </p>
<p> Verizon has a serious appetite for video content as of late. In addition to promoting the heck out of GO90 and its various American sports partnerships, the company bought AOL and Yahoo, which has media aspirations of its own. The latest horse to arrive at the stable is Vessel, a sort of alternative YouTube for creators who try to make "premium" videos that are good enough to warrant subscription payments from users. The service started up last year with channels from notable YouTube creators. </p>
<p> To be honest, I'm still not sold on Vessel's business model, which posts original web video content a few days early to paying subscribers before it goes out to more general portals (usually YouTube). But the Android app seems more than serviceable even in its beta form, and the developers are adding features quickly. Case in point: the latest update adds Chromecast compatibility, which no video app should be without. </p>
<p> The feature works exactly as you'd expect it to: start a video and look for the Chromecast icon, then connect to a local Chromecast or Android TV device. You can connect on the main viewer screen as well, if you don't want to scramble to send your video as soon as it starts. </p>
<p> Vessel has a beta Android app now. You're probably wondering what Vessel is, though. Imagine YouTube with less content, but the content shows up a few days early. Oh, and you have to pay for it. Interested? I didn't think so, but the app exists nonetheless. </p>

<p> CBS All Access might have had the most lukewarm reception of a new streaming service to date when it launched in late 2014, though the mountain of new terrible Star Trek shows has given it periodic bumps in subscriber counts. Now that CBS has merged with Viacom (after splitting in 2005), the combined media conglomerate is preparing to re-launch CBS All Access with more content and a new name. </p>
<p> BET's on-demand streaming service, BET+, has launched, and it's got apps for both Android and Android TV ready right out of the gate. The service is a collaborative effort between BET Networks and Tyler Perry Studios, and features content principally by black creators. </p>
<p> Media giant Viacom announced yesterday that it's come to an agreement with free streaming TV provider Pluto TV to purchase the service for the seemingly absurd sum of $340 million in cash. Viacom sees the platform as a way to attract customers to its paid streaming platforms, including such offerings as Comedy Central Now and Noggin. </p>
<p> We might be fans of Android in general here, but we've also been vocal critics of Android TV—though Google promises to make things better someday. But even in its current form, it's a popular platform for many via devices like Nvidia's SHIELD TV. In a strange development, Viacom appears to have removed Android TV support for many of its apps, including Comedy Central, VH1, MTV, and BET. Even weirder, for a brief period some of the apps themselves seemed to have disappeared from Android TV devices. </p>

<p> These days, traditional TV is becoming less and less common. With the advent of streaming, people can choose what to watch when they want to watch it. YouTube TV launched back in 2017 with the promise to bring cable into the modern age. Over the years, the service has added a lot of features, but at what cost? Today, Google is announcing that eight new channels from ViacomCBS are live on YouTube TV, along with a price jump from $49.99 up to $64.99. </p>
<p> According to a press release issued earlier today, ViacomCBS will be bringing more of its channel lineup to Google's YouTube TV, with fourteen new channels coming. The new multi-year distribution agreement includes BET, Comedy Central, and Nickelodeon. </p>

<p> viber </p>
<p> Viber has been releasing a bunch of new features and upgrades lately, from increasing its group call limits to letting users save notes and to-dos. Now the messaging service has launched a GIF creation tool on iOS... with Android to follow in the coming weeks 😒. </p>
<p> In many countries around the world right now, social distancing or even stricter quarantine measures have been put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus — this means we're all far more dependent on technology if we want to hang out with our friends. Zoom and Houseparty get-togethers might be all the rage right now, but other communication apps are also doing their bit in this time of need. Viber has increased the maximum number of participants in group calls to 20 so you can chat with more of your friends at once. </p>
<p> Viber announced today a new note-taking feature appropriately dubbed "My Notes." Notes are accessible from your Chats list; adding a new note is the same experience as sending a message, and your list of notes looks an awful lot like a normal Viber conversation, but with additional features to help with organization. </p>
<p> Things were simpler back in the days of SMS, but now you have to choose which silo you're going to lock yourself inside. The messaging world has been consumed by the likes of Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, but there are also smaller players like Viber. Fans of that app will be happy to hear there's a dark mode in the latest update, and you don't even have to send a moon emoji to anyone. </p>
<p> Books, movies, and series are common ways to widely share a story, but it's far more common to tell personal adventures orally or over text messages. However, Viber came up with a new feature that mixes things up, letting you read short stories on your phone, which take the shape of fictitious text messages. </p>
<p> Messaging apps are only good when many people use them. That's why the market is dominated by a few big players like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and good ol' text messages. Other platforms have to find ways to incentivize people to switch to them, and one way to do that is by offering features the leaders don't yet have. That's why Viber is introducing Create a Sticker, allowing you to make and share your own sticker sets without leaving the app. </p>
<p> When it comes to messaging apps, companies are fighting to increase their market shares with features such as screen sharing, context-aware recommendations, and even fact-checking services. Viber has been busy improving its offering with the recent addition of a dark mode and the ability to edit sent messages. However, some elementary features were missing compared to its most famous rival, like quick replies and clearer conversation status visibility. These are finally making their way to the app with the rollout of minor improvements that make the software just a little more convenient to use. </p>
<p> Thanks to messaging platforms like Viber, calling and texting across the world is a breeze and doesn't cost a dime. However, there are circumstances when people need to call or text you with an actual phone without relying on an Internet connection. For instance, if you live abroad, it would be easier for your grandma to give you a ring with her old-fashioned landline. A local number can also be handy to confirm a booking, or even let your foreign clients dial you in more easily. For all these occasions, you previously had to go through the hassle of using an app to get a virtual line or buy a local number. </p>
<p> Viber just announced the launch of the latest revision to its mobile messaging app, bringing a new UI and some new group features. The company also claims that the redesign offers users double the performance when sending messages. </p>
<p> Making a typo you can't correct is one of the more frustrating parts of text communication. Viber seems to agree, because now you're able to edit messages you've sent through the service. Like in other apps that offer similar functions, edited messages will be marked as such to limit any possible confusion. </p>

<p> It's a pretty big day for Viber, the popular VoIP application that brings "free messages and calls" to your mobile. Seems that the guys behind the app (appropriately named Viber Media) have been hard at work preparing not only major updates to the Android and iOS applications, but also on an all-new desktop client for Windows and Mac. </p>
<p> The update to the Android version of the app brings many new features, including a new Holo'd-out look. Aside from that, you can now send video messages, a new voice engine improves the audio quality, there's an online status indicator, and you can transfer active calls seamlessly between the mobile app and the just-released desktop client. </p>

<p> vibe z2 pro </p>
<p> Lenovo is an up-and-coming player in the Android world, having taken the Chinese smartphone market by storm in the last couple of years. Now that it owns Motorola, we'll likely be hearing the Lenovo name even more often over here in the US as the company seeks to expand the presence of its Android portfolio across the world. </p>
<p> This is probably especially true of tablets, which Lenovo has consistently been creating for a number of years now, and an area where Motorola has generally fallen flat. </p>
<p> Lenovo, despite being the relatively new owners of Motorola Mobility, didn't need this acquisition to produce attractive new hardware - at least for markets other than the US. The Vibe Z, which never made it to our corner of the world, looks poised to get a sequel that ups its game in every area that matters. Shots of a phone dubbed the Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro have surfaced, showing a 6-inch phone with a quad HD display, a 4000mAh battery, a 16MP OIS camera with dual LED flash, and a Snapdragon 801 processor.

<p> We are no longer supporting the Vibrant due to the inability to dial 911. We consider the issues related to this unresolvable without source code from Samsung related to the Radio interface layer and its interactions with the Audio layers and have taken the decision to no longer support this. </p>
<p> If you have a Samsung Vibrant running CyanongenMod, then you probably want to flash a a stock-based ROM double-quick. Why? Because you can't call 911 while running CM on this particular device. Sure, you may not remember the last time you had to call 911 (if ever), but can you imagine what would happen if you were in a situation where you needed to call 911 and couldn't? </p>
<p> For this exact reason, the CM team has decided to drop support for the Vibrant. </p>
<p> This article deals with a couple of advanced topics. If you’re unfamiliar with some of the terms, hit up our primers here: </p>
<p> Horrific battery life on Android phones is nothing new, and neither is the mind-blowing shattering frailty of said handsets. We've seen - and reviewed - solutions to both of these issues, but for those who want a convenient, all-in-one product, nothing beats XPAL's "PowerSkins." </p>
<p> Available for a variety of devices, PowerSkins are, in a sentence, silicone cases with built-in batteries from which your phone can sip juice once its internal supply has run dry. </p>
<p> What a week for Samsung Galaxy S family device owners! First, the Captivate was officially added to the list of devices supported by CyanogenMod, the largest Android ROM community in the world, and now not 1 but 3 more phones are following suit - the Galaxy S, the T-Mobile Vibrant, and the Sprint Nexus S 4G (crespo4g). </p>
<p> The news hit yesterday, but since no downloadable builds were available from the CM mirror network until late last night, we decided to wait until they're up. </p>
<p> Galaxy S owners, you may have a reason for some early celebration. CyanogenMod 7 for the GS variants, which has been around in relatively unsupported early alpha stages for the last couple of months, has just gone quite a bit more formal with the introduction of the new "captivatemtd" device branch. </p>
<p> What does it mean? Captivate is the first device of the Galaxy S bunch to move to the official CM download area in the form of nightlies. </p>
<p> Whilst browsing the Apps and Games section of XDA-Developers we came across an interesting thread about a relatively new application from Samsung, for the Galaxy S. This simply-named Video Editor looks to fill the void until the delicious-looking one from Honeycomb trickles down to our phones' OS versions. </p>
<p> Strangely enough, the app appears to only work on 2.2+ devices, limiting it to the i9000 and Vibrant when it comes to Samsung's own devices. </p>
<p> T-Mobile just announced their upcoming Valentine's Day sale: all smartphones will be free on a new 2-year agreement, upgrade, or the addition of a new line from February 11-12. This includes all two of T-Mobile's available HSPA+ devices: the G2 and myTouch 4G. Why this Valentine's day sale doesn't actually take place on Valentine's day is somewhat obvious: a slew of new Android handsets will probably be announced that day at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. </p>
<p> While it's not exactly revolutionary, it does pack some unique goodies - most importantly, T-Mobile claims its Samsung ST-Ericsson M5720 HPSA+ 4G modem makes it capable of theoretical peak download speeds of 21 Mbps, whereas the G2 and myTouch 4G are limited to 14.4 Mbps. </p>
<p> Whether you believe the rumors about Samsung's Android upgrade plans or not doesn't really matter - the company has proven again and again that when it comes to older devices (read: released more than 3-4 months), your chances of an update drop dramatically. Froyo has been around for over 6 months now, but 3 out of 4 flagship Galaxy S devices in the U.S. (Captivate, Fascinate, Epic 4G) are still sporting outdated and Flashless Eclair builds, while the rest were only just upgraded in the last month or so. </p>

<p> vibrant 4g </p>
<p> Thanks to a leaked slide, some rumored release dates for upcoming T-Mobile 4G devices have been cemented. First up is Dell's Streak 7, which is set to debut on February 2; that will be followed by the Galaxy S 4G on February 23, while the Honeycomb-sporting G-Slate won't be launching until March 23. </p>
<p> Also leaked were two promos for the Streak 7 that nail down an on-contract (presumably) price of $299 - a pretty good deal for two cores and 7 inches of screen real-estate. </p>
<p> Well, if there was any lesson against being an early adopter, let it be this: TmoNews has gotten ahold of some official T-Mobile slides that give details on the Samsung Vibrant 4G, an update to T-Mobile's version of the Galaxy S that will make any current VIbrant owner cringe: </p>
<p> Full HSPA+ connectivity </p>
<p> Front-facing camera with Qik (not Skype) pre-loaded and still no flash on the rear camera </p>
<p> Android 2.2 Froyo </p>
<p> By full HSPA+ connectivity, I mean that the Vibrant 4G is able to reach download speeds of 21 Mbps (2.6 MB/s) and above, while T-Mobile's current 4G phones, the MyTouch 4G and G2, are limited to 14.4 Mbps, or just under 2 MB/s. </p>

<p> This seems to be the week of Bluetooth bugs. In what could be a related issue, we've received reports that notifications and notification sounds are being doubled (or even tripled) on Android devices which are paired with other Bluetooth devices. Some are also reporting that media and ringer volume are being inexplicably paired together, resulting in do not disturb, silent, and vibrate mode settings being effectively ignored when media channel volume is above silent. </p>
<p> We're still combing through all the small and major changes in Android P DP2, and one of the things we noticed is that the Alarm Quick Setting icon that was added in DP1 disappeared, but that doesn't mean you can't see your upcoming alarms anymore. In its lieu, Android now displays the next alarm on top of the expanded Quick Settings and brightness slider. But that's not the only thing you'll see there. </p>
<p> When it landed a couple months back, Android P delivered significant changes to the volume button dialog, relocating it to be closer to the keys themselves while setting media volume as the new default. Unfortunately, that latter change meant it's a bit harder to actually change ringer modes without tapping the screen. </p>
<p> In the latest developer preview for Android P, Google has added a new configurable hardware key combo that lets you press volume up and power simultaneously to set the ringer mode to silent or vibrate, giving us a complex and counter-intuitive solution to a problem that didn't need to exist. </p>
<p> Do you find yourself constantly adjusting the volume of your phone's ringtone, or wishing that the annoying buzz of your phone's vibration could be toned down a little? Looking to solve all of your ringtone/vibration woes (while making sure you don't miss a call), Michael Pardo has introduced RingDimmer to the Android Market. The app adjusts vibration intensity and ringer volume based on ambient noise, ensuring that you never miss a call, and never have to be disrupted by an inappropriately loud ring tone. </p>
<p> The first thing users will notice about RingDimmer is its simple interface. When I say simple, I mean the entire app consists of one screen and two checkboxes. </p>
<p> Last month we told you about the Immersion MOTIV platform, which would allow developers to have much more control over the way phones use haptic feedback (the way your phone vibrates). Up to this point, Android haptic feedback has been a very cut and dry affair: it turns on, it turns off, sometimes it's on a little longer, and sometimes it isn't. Immersion, the SDK of which is now available, gives devs the tools to make this a much more varied experience. </p>
<p> Say you are playing a console video game like Uncharted 2 on the PS3. Your controller will vibrate in response to what is going on around you. </p>
<p> WhoIsIt is a new twist on an old classic: setting custom ringtones for certain contacts (or groups of contacts). The twist is that you can assign custom ringtones and vibrations for Gmail, SMS, and MMS, on a per-contact basis. Not too shabby, especially for a free app. Other features include: </p>
<p> * Ability to setup VIP contacts for Gmail, SMS, and MMS * Allow VIP contacts to ring / notify for Gmail, SMS, and MMS even when in Silent mode * Announce incoming caller and SMS/MMS sender * Define different volume / vibration profiles * Widget for easily switching profiles * Tasker plugin * Disable LEDs on a per-profile basis * Ringleader integration </p>
<p> At the moment, the app is still in public beta at version .92. </p>

<p> In the wake of our Pixel 5 review, we were left thinking about the subject of haptics and what, precisely, separates good haptics from bad. It's hard to quantify a sensory experience, and that's part of why phone reviews are a thing. But we've dug into the subject, and even sat down with Cirrus Logic (who makes haptic solutions for phones) for a quick educational course. </p>
<p> Dolphin Emulator — the popular Wii and GameCube emulator — recently returned to the Play Store, making it easy to keep updated as Android beta development continues, and so it has. According to the latest progress report, Dolphin now has support for on-phone rumble/vibration in GameCube titles. Landscape mode is now forced by default as well on Android, and the developers would also like to apologize for some recent changes which broke existing savestates without warning for many. </p>
<p> Back in the day, Light Flow was an integral part of the Android enthusiast toolkit. Nexus phones came with snazzy multicolored LEDs for notifications, but customization options were limited. Light Flow filled that gap with per-app and per-notification type tweaks. Sadly for those that might still be using it, Google's API targeting requirements will be limiting colored LED support going forward. Per-contact and call/SMS/MMS distinguishing notification customization will also have to be abandoned as a result of other developer policy changes. </p>
<p> If there is one feature I've wanted in stock Android for a long time, it's the option to disable the vibration. I hate it with all my might and can't comprehend how so many OEM versions of Android have already understood the need to have a separate vibration option whereas stock just keeps it enabled regardless. Your phone rings? It has to vibrate too. No easy silent mode either, only vibrate or DND. Ugh, it's incomprehensible. But luckily, Android P has the burgeoning of a solution. </p>
<p> Google's Pixel 2 XL might be a great phone, but it hasn't been without controversy. Now we can add one more issue to the growing list. For many, one or both of the phone's front-facing speakers suffer from distortion/rattling. In some cases, the problem only seems to crop up at louder volumes, but for others (including us here at AP) it occurs even at lower volumes such as during phone calls. </p>
<p> Smartwatch wearers have to put up with a number of drawbacks. There's the typically crappy battery life, the bulkiness (or ugliness, depending on whose eyes are looking), and the remarks people get when they've been looking at their watch for longer than a passing glance. "Are you in a hurry?" "Is there somewhere else you'd rather be?" "Am I that boring?" Even if the answer to all three questions is yes, that still doesn't explain the situation at hand, or should I say, wrist (pause for groans). </p>
<p> The developer of Augmented SmartWatch Pro has addressed this issue by adding customizable haptic feedback options for Android Wear devices in the latest update. </p>
<p> There's a large market for a device like the Vibease wearable smart vibrator, which has been on Indiegogo for all of a day and has already exceeded its $15,000 fundraising goal by a full $10,000. There are the proud independent women who swear they don't need a man. There are the husbands who just want to keep the misses happy, even though they don't really know how. There's the leagues of Fifty Shades of Grey fans who just found out kink is a thing and are now raring to dip their fingers in this brave new world. Then there are us young millennial couples who grew up learning about these things from the internet anyway, so why not give something like this a try? </p>
<p> My phone spends about two thirds of the day on silent or vibrate mode due to classes, meetings, or other events where it may be inappropriate to have a ringtone going off, so when I heard about ViBe, my interest was already piqued. The problem – until now – with keeping your phone in vibrate mode, is that there is no way to know who exactly is calling or texting without indiscreetly peeking at your screen, which can be almost as distracting as if you had the ringer turned on. </p>
<p> All of that changes today, however, with Base2Apps' introduction of ViBe, an awesome new app that allows the user to set custom vibration patterns for individual contacts. </p>
<p> When it comes to haptic feedback, which is a fancy term for the way your smartphone vibrates or physically responds to your actions, smartphone users are not used to much variety. Unlike the complicated haptic motors in console gaming controllers, my EVO has a pretty standard and very basic vibrating motor inside, and the only aspect apps can control is the length of the vibration. Boooring. </p>
<p> The Future Of Haptic Feedback </p>
<p> Earlier this week, I met with marketing execs from Immersion, which makes software for those haptic motors that let your handset vibrate. When asked for an example of a device that has Immersion-powered chips in them, I was given the whole Galaxy S line, which shows the company means business. </p>

<p> According to a report published earlier today by Vice's Motherboard, Instacart workers are planning a nationwide strike next Monday, March 30th. Instacart's shoppers, who handle the "front-line" work of actually buying the goods you order, are requesting additional benefits from the company, including access to hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes, and soap; an expansion of paid sick leave to cover those with pre-existing conditions warned not to work; and an extra $5 per order as hazard pay. </p>
<p> If you're looking for a good story to dig into on your commute home or the next paid bathroom visit, then you might want to check out this story Vice published two days ago. It's got everything you expect from a good, long-format news story (except lasers, anyway), describing a worldwide scandal over a smartphone company run by drug traffickers selling encrypted devices. It's a tale loaded with murder, torture, drugs, the Moroccan mafia, and ROMed Nexuses — not much more you can ask for. </p>

<p> vice president </p>
<p> Chrome and Android have been strengthening the old Google family ties for a while now, but according to a report from the Wall Street Journal, they just got a little tighter. The WSJ reports that Hiroshi Lockheimer, who currently serves as the Vice President of Engineering for Android, has also assumed the role of Vice President of Engineering for Chrome. That would put him in charge to a greater or lesser degree of the Chrome browser on desktops, Chromebooks and similar ChromeOS hardware, and Chrome on Android and iOS, plus whatever else Google has cooking up. </p>
<p> Cyanogen, the corporate arm of the popular CyanogenMod custom ROM, is on a roll. After a few high-profile hires from the world of aftermarket Android ROMs earlier this year, the company is after some more conventional hires for its leadership team, dipping their toes into the pool of corporate technology. This week they welcome Tyler Carper, formerly of HTC, Vikram Natarajan, formerly of OEM parts manufacturer MediaTek, and Dave Herman, formerly of Microsoft, Amazon, and Hulu, as new vice presidents. </p>

<p> LineageOS 17.1 is the latest release of the popular custom ROM, based on Android 10. The LineageOS project was already providing daily builds for over 60 phones and tablets, but in the time since we last covered the ROM, a handful of additional phones have been granted official support. </p>
<p> The LineageOS project is busy as always, adding support for more devices and implementing new features. The last time we covered the popular custom ROM, official builds for the OnePlus 6T and 7 Pro arrived, and there have been plenty of additions (or re-additions, in some cases) since then. </p>
<p> LineageOS is one of the most popular custom ROMs available, with somewhere around two million active installations. It typically takes a while for the project to update to newer versions of Android, since development is largely done by maintainers in their spare time. Six months after the public release of Android 9 Pie, it looks like LineageOS is about ready to make the jump — but not before dropping older devices. </p>

<p> Thanksgiving isn't just about turkey and mashed potatoes (sorry, I had to), it's also about snapping up deals on the things you've been waiting all year to buy, or the things you've yet to cross off your holiday shopping list. </p>
<p> Sprint, in a newsroom post earlier today, announced that it would be sharing "the gift of 'Unlimited' for the holiday shopping season," revealing a few nice deals customers can take advantage of between Thanksgiving and "Cyber Monday." </p>
<p> You may remember Samsung's Galaxy Victory 4G LTE (formerly known as "Gogh") from some training materials we caught sight of just a few days ago. Well, while the device is still unannounced, good old Sammy has decided to drop the Victory's kernel source ahead of time for anxious developers and tweakers to get started on. </p>
<p> Samsung has had a good track record lately of releasing kernel source just after a device is announced, but releasing the code before we're even supposed to know about a device is pretty impressive. </p>

<p> Paying via NFC with Google Pay is more convenient, safe, and hygienic than swiping a payment card through a seldomly cleaned payment terminal. These days, almost every flagship phone includes the NFC interface required for Google Pay to function. But that doesn't guarantee that tap-to-pay will actually work. Recently, issues have popped up on the Galaxy Note20 Ultra and the Pixel 5 — but it looks like this problem might be much more far reaching. </p>
<p> Camera quality has always been a major differentiating factor when choosing between smartphones, but it seems like the competition has gotten more intense over the last few years. Some manufactures like OnePlus and Huawei use sensors with big megapixel counts to stand out from the crowd, while others like Apple and Google rely more on the marriage between hardware and software. With such a tight race for the winner of the camera crown, we're highlighting three recent YouTube comparisons worth a watch. </p>
<p> In cooperation with ArtPlay Games, NetEase just announced that it will bring the popular Metroidvania title Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night to Android and iOS, and the game will be released worldwide as a premium title, just like on consoles and PC. Bloodstained was created by Koji Igarashi, the producer behind some of the more popular Castlevania titles such as Harmony of Dissonance. This is why the 2019 release for Bloodstained was hotly anticipated, which is why I'm sure more than a few people will be excited to see how the game stacks up on mobile. </p>

<p> For the last decade, i-Blason has been making cases for some of the most popular smartphones, tablets, and wearables on the planet. Engineered to be both functional and visually stunning, i-Blason's products buck outdated design trends by offering unique styles that can't be found anywhere else.

<p> Welcome to the roundup of the new Android games that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous week or so. Today's list is broken up into several segments, ranging from best, average, to mediocre game releases from the last week. So whether you're looking for the best games of quality or are simply looking for the latest gacha releases, you're covered. This week we saw the arrival of a gorgeous textless adventure game, the launch of the sequel to 911 Operator, and the debut of an enjoyable brick breaker that sports an artistic theme. </p>
<p> Sony is starting to send out PlayStation 5 consoles (and the accompanying controllers) to reviewers and influencers, including tech YouTuber Austin Evans. Evans published an initial video about the console's 'DualSense' controller yesterday, which revealed an interesting detail for you smartphone gamers out there — the PS5 controller appears to work with Android. </p>
<p> Insta360 has made a name for itself in the enthusiast 360 camera market thanks to a line of consistently excellent products that culminated in the One X in 2018, possibly the most lauded 360 cam of its time. The company came back in 2020 with a more ambitious project: a modular cam that can transform from an action shooter to a 360 cam — and other potential form factors — in a snap. </p>
<p> But in aiming to do everything and in trying to copy the GoPro so much, the company has introduced a long list of compromises that didn't plague its previous offerings. </p>
<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Android applications and live wallpapers that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous week or so. Today I have a lite version of the Yahoo app, a calendar quick tile app, and a travel blogging app from Lonely Planet. So without further ado, here are all of the new and notable Android apps released on the Play Store in the last week. </p>

<p> Movie theaters are slowly reopening, but most of the new releases are headed to streaming services rather than the big screen. Whether you're staying at home to limit potential risks, or just saving a few bucks by watching from the couch, we've organized a huge list with many of the newly added films and some upcoming titles. </p>
<p> New this week: </p>
<p> The major lineup of Halloween movies came earlier this month, but that doesn't mean we're done with the theme. If you're looking for something to put in front of the kids, The Whitches is an obvious choice and features Anne Hathaway and Stanley Tucci. </p>

<p> Kabam and Netmarble are teaming up once again with Marvel to bring a new real-time RPG to Android. This title is known as Marvel Realm of Champions, and it will serve duty as the followup to Marvel Contest of Champions. It's expected to land sometime in 2020. Apparently, Realm of Champions will offer a reimagining of the Marvel Universe that's set on Battleworld, a forbidden planet hidden behind the Space-Time Barrier recently disrupted by the death of Maestro, the God-King. </p>

<p> video ads </p>
<p> Early last year, Google rolled out a new monetization method for developers to take advantage of in their apps. The woefully non-descriptive "rewarded products" allowed for things like watching videos to get in-game currency or extra lives — you get the idea. For simplicity, it was built right into the Google Play Billing Library, but Google has just announced that it will be deprecating the feature on April 21st, 2020, about two months from now. </p>
<p> Google joined the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group intended to make online advertising less annoying, back in 2017. The news made headlines because Google also revealed that it would potentially block any advertising in Chrome that violated the group's ad guidelines. While there never seemed to be any high-profile takedowns, and there are still countless sites that violate the existing standards, the group has now created new rules for video ads. </p>
<p> Advertisements are part of life, but they don't need to play a role at the wrong parts of your life. One prime example can be found with document scanning app CamScanner where, for at least the past month, users have been encountering loud, full-screen video commercials while trying to use the app while conducting business. </p>
<p> Your Flipboard experience is going to change a little bit today. Users of the social-magazine-thing are going to start seeing full-screen video ads, which Flipboard kindly describes as "a deeper brand moment." It's not as annoying as it seems at first, though. </p>

<p> Did you know that there's nothing free on Hulu anymore? I didn't, until I tried to track down the latest episodes of awful-yet-addictive CW superhero shows that I pour into my eyes like the pop cultural equivalent of fast food. Yes, it turns out the networks that comprise Hulu's adulterous corporate parents have walled off all those TV episodes behind a paywall. But fear not, cable-cutting penny-pinchers: at least some of those shows have a new home on Yahoo View. According to Yahoo, the app is available only in the US. </p>
<p> If you pay for cable, you probably pay for ESPN. Disney's sports empire is practically inescapable, especially if you watch college sports, and it's essentially impossible to pay for conventional television without getting ESPN thrown into the package, whether you want it or not. So if you're paying for it, you might as well get it on your phone too, right? ESPN's live streaming service WatchESPN is now available within the primary ESPN app itself. Previously WatchESPN was a separate Android app. </p>
<p> Remember Milk Video? No, it's not a special Internet repository of all those Got Milk ads, it's Samsung's device-exclusive video arm of the Milk Music service. And now it's not long for this world. Samsung chose the rather unceremonious venue of an updated Play Store app description to let users know that the company will be ending support for the app in November. </p>
<p> Thank you for using Samsung Milk Video. While we remain committed to providing premium entertainment services, we have decided to end support for the Samsung Milk Video app as of November 20, 2015. To continue enjoying streaming entertainment, please use the Samsung Milk Music app available at:http://smsng.us/1L4Zqd3 </p>
<p> To be honest, I'm still not sold on Vessel's business model, which posts original web video content a few days early to paying subscribers before it goes out to more general portals (usually YouTube). But the Android app seems more than serviceable even in its beta form, and the developers are adding features quickly. Case in point: the latest update adds Chromecast compatibility, which no video app should be without. </p>
<p> The feature works exactly as you'd expect it to: start a video and look for the Chromecast icon, then connect to a local Chromecast or Android TV device. You can connect on the main viewer screen as well, if you don't want to scramble to send your video as soon as it starts. </p>
<p> Do you like Halo? I mean really like Halo, like you've got a little light-up Cortana on your desk and you actually know the names of the various rainbow color versions of the Master Chief? Can you write me a 20-page essay on the leadup to and fallout from the battle of Reach? Then today is your lucky day, because Halo has come to Android... in the form of a video app with clips and guides and stuff. OK, so maybe not especially lucky. </p>
<p> Since Microsoft seems oblivious to the fact that no one really expects the next installment of Halo to blow anyone away, they've decided to try and push it as a cultural nexus analogous to Call of Duty or League of Legends. </p>
<p> Those few Android developers and other fanatics who got a pricey Golden Ticket to Google I/O are the first to experience Android TV, thanks to the ADT-1 developer set-top boxes that were distributed at the show. They get to try out all the cool new Android TV apps months before everyone else. Except today - today, AOL allows those users to feel solidarity with everyone else, because there are new apps that they can't play with. For some reason. </p>
<p> AOL published both AOL On and HuffPost Live for Android TV to the Play Store, marked as incompatible with everything including the ADT-1. </p>
<p> Even after years on the market and innumerable would-be competitors, GoPro remains the standard for "action cameras." A big part of that is the excellent smartphone integration that GoPro's devices have maintained, and today the official Android app gets a little better in a lot of small ways. The most obvious is the new user interface, which is visible on Android 4.0 and above. The all-black UI keeps its focus on minimalism and utility, but gets rid of some of the gradients of the former interface. </p>
<p> New above, old below. </p>
<p> There are also some more useful additions, most notably an automatic WiFi connection. </p>
<p> If you've got a late-model Samsung "smart" camera, you should check out this nifty function. Samsung Home Monitor lets owners of the upcoming NX3000 camera (and presumably other models in the NX line) view video from the camera's lens remotely on their phones. It's a neat application of the hardware available. </p>
<p> Using the simple app, you can treat your camera like a security camera or baby/pet monitor. Users can stream live video from the camera at any time, as long as there's Wi-Fi in the house and your smartphone has a data connect (Wi-Fi or mobile). In an impressive display of practical design, the camera can also be activated by sound or motion, alerting the smartphone app via a notification. </p>
<p> Take note, video app developers: your Android app should have Chromecast support by now. It just makes things so much better for everybody. Video site Dailymotion knows where it's at, because the latest version of the beta app in the Play Store can now stream to the Chromecast. Better late than never, huh? </p>
<p> Other than Chromecast support and the usual bugfixes and performance tweaks, there doesn't appear to be any other significant changes to version 4.1. Casting videos works in the usual way, just tap the Chromecast icon and select the unit you want to use. The app allows you to make the connection even before you select a video, so you'll be able to watch your content uninterrupted. </p>
<p> After the big steaming pile that was the Super Bowl, American sports fans must be anticipating the Winter Olympics with even more keenness. NBC is more than willing to oblige with the latest in an already-long list of Sochi 2014 apps - the NBC Olympics Highlights app (which seems to have a plural problem). In addition to standard replay videos, the app serves as a second screen for NBC's nightly recap show. </p>
<p> The app itself seems pretty good as these things go - we've definitely seen worse Olympic-themed entries already. But there are a few issues, starting with the fact that you'll need to be in the United States to use it; hooray for the IOC's media contracts. </p>

<p> Disney's Movies Anywhere has just launched a new service that allows you to store and access all your movies in one place. It has support from 5 major Hollywood studios, but more importantly also from 4 digital retailers where users already have movie libraries. Content from Amazon Video, Google Play, iTunes, and Vudu can be brought into the Movies Anywhere app, which is great for anyone with a fragmented collection spanning more than one of those services. Now, you'll only ever need to use one app again. </p>
<p> Comcast is doing what Comcast does best: making its monopolized customers really, really hate the company. That's just Comcast's general state of being, but in this specific sense, it's all about the streaming cable TV app for Android. As promised, the former XFINITY TV app has been replaced with the all-new, all-different XFINITY Stream. </p>
<p> These days, GoPro is the king of the hill for action and aerial photography. Sure, you could wrap some tape around your phone and send it up on a quadcopter or toss it into a sandwich bag and hope it doesn't spring a leak at the bottom of the pool, but those are terrible ideas—seriously, don't try them. Since you won't be putting your phone (or tablet) through near certain destruction, why not use it instead to edit those great videos? GoPro announced that it has acquired popular mobile video editing apps Replay and Splice. Both apps are currently iOS exclusives, but the company has plans to bring them to Android later this year. </p>
<p> Vine isn't a platform known for outstanding videography, on account of being limited to mobile cameras (not to mention the time limit). But starting today, users on Android should notice a definite improvement in the quality of uploaded videos, at least according to the latest app update. Of course, the quality will still be limited by your phone or tablet's camera and the shooting conditions in any particular location. Exactly how video quality is being improved (bitrate bump? Resolution? Post-processing?) hasn't been addressed. </p>
<p> The only other notable update is to the notification options. I'm not a regular Vine user myself, but the Settings menu now includes options to display Likes, Comments, Re-vines, Mentions, and Follows in either a semi-curated "tailored to you" fashion or from anyone. </p>

<p> If you're out and about and want to talk to someone at home, you can pick from several options. If you own a Google Assistant Smart Display — be it a Nest Hub, a Lenovo Smart Display, JBL Link View, or LG ThinQ View — you get one more possibility: You can video call your display to have a face-to-face chat. Although that feature has been available for a year, it wasn't well known, so Google has been trying to better surface it to users. </p>
<p> If you have one of the fancy new Assistant Smart Displays, be it the already available Lenovo or the soon-to-be-released JBL Link View, odds are you're going to set up Duo on it and use it for video calls. One neat feature that you may not be aware of, though, is that you can video call your display from your phone, with both set up to use the same Duo account. </p>

<p> video capture </p>
<p> Microsoft has released the first Android beta of Hyperlapse Mobile, the culmination of a couple of years research. The app captures video from your camera and outputs a smooth, sped-up time lapse, which is far more complicated than you might expect. It can also convert existing videos. Rather than simply give you an end product that is akin to watching your video on fast forward, Hyperlapse intelligently chooses frames that make it far easier to watch. </p>
<p> You know the pain of watching a vertical video in a world based on horizontal players. Google took a swing at fixing that with the Google Camera app, which warns users not to do that. Horizon actually fixes the issue by letting you take a proper horizontal video while holding the phone in any orientation. It's magic! </p>
<p> The PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One all allow gamers to record and broadcast gameplay online via Twitch, turning even single-player games into social experiences. Now the technology is coming to Android. Today Twitch has announced the release of its mobile SDK, which game developers can use to provide players with functionality similar to that found on consoles. Mobile gamers will soon be able to share their mobile gaming experience with the rest of the Twitch community. </p>
<p> Screencast Video Recorder has been a favorite of ours since its release, and has been featured in our own Top Android Apps Every Rooted User Should Know About and Best Of 2011 posts. Needless to say, we think this app is top notch, and I'm sure tons of other Android users would agree. Not only does it offer video capture with many features, but it has some pretty nice screenshot functionality as well. </p>

<p> video chat </p>
<p> In an effort to slice off a larger piece of the video conferencing pie, Google has been dedicating a lot of resources to Meet lately. The service started showing up in Gmail last month (here's how to turn it off), and Google said that a bunch of new features would be coming later this year. Now it looks like two of those additions are showing up — one ahead of schedule. </p>
<p> We've been using video calls more than ever in the past few months, and probably will continue to for the foreseeable future. It's tough not being able to travel to see your loved ones, but Google is making things a bit easier by announcing beta Android TV support for its Duo video calling service. </p>
<p> Google Meet, the company's Zoom competitor and successor to Hangouts, has gained plenty of new users and features over the past few months due to the pandemic. With everyone working and playing from home, video chatting is a necessity these days, and Meet might eventually become Google's sole option. Viewing conference calls on TVs and other Chromecast-enabled devices has only been possible by casting your entire phone screen or browser tab until now, but Google has now baked the functionality directly into the Meet interface. </p>

<p> While Zoom may be the defacto video calling and conferencing app of 2020, many of us are probably using it more out of convenience than anything else. And while video calling and conferencing are two distinctly different things—a set time and place call-in meeting versus a often on-the-fly call-out chat—the lines between the two are increasingly blurred with so many of us working from home. </p>
<p> If you're looking to get out of the Zoom bubble for your smaller work meetings or social calls with friends and family, Google Duo is actually a pretty awesome option, and we'll break down just why that is in this post. </p>
<p> The coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent quarantine it caused have made video calling services a mainstay of every household. While Zoom's popularity has skyrocketed, other services have done their best to catch up. Google's Duo added more features than we can count over the past few months, and upped the group call limit from 8 to 12 in March. That capacity has now been increased again to 32. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/09 2:20pm PDTon May 9, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/16 1:13pm PDTon Jun 16, 2020. </p>
<p> Google has made good on its earlier promise to expand the number of participants in Duo video calls. Support for up to 32-person calls is now rolling out for Duo on Chrome, ramping up the platform's ability to scale to compete with Zoom calls. </p>
<p> As modern society rapidly prepares for what will become one of the loneliest times we will likely ever know, it doesn't mean singles have to be stuck in limbo until things return to normal. Dating service Plenty of Fish is launching a new video streaming feature that will make it easier for potential dates to meet virtually without abandoning the practice of social distancing for an IRL meeting. </p>
<p> Google is on a rampage to transcribe anything that generates speech on its Android platform in real-time. For most Android phones, users can transcribe voice memos with Live Transcribe. Pixels, though, can get system-wide transcription with Live Caption. So, where's the next step forward? Maybe it's with Duo messages. </p>
<p> The renaissance of mobile room-based video chat applications has largely passed, with even Facebook deciding their clone didn't need to stick around. One of the original players, Houseparty, has managed to continue running. In fact, today the app was acquired by video game giant Epic Games. </p>

<p> video codec </p>
<p> AV1 is the hot new video codec on the block, offering around 30% better compression than Google's VP9 standard without a noticeable loss in picture quality. With Chrome and Android now supporting the format natively, many services have started to switch to it, and now Netflix is joining the fun. </p>
<p> Testing by Facebook engineers found that the Alliance for Open Media's new video codec, AV1, outperforms widely-used standards like the x264 and VP9 codecs, Facebook announced in a post on its engineering blog this week. While AV1 exhibits better compression, videos do take longer to encode with the new format. </p>
<p> Like any organization set up by the Joint Development Foundation, the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) is a group of companies set up to collaborate on the introduction of a technological standard. In the case of AOMedia, its purpose is specifically to accelerate the development and adoption of a new video compression codec called AV1. </p>

<p> Following its unprecedented rise to popularity during the coronavirus pandemic, Zoom quickly found itself under scrutiny from privacy and security experts for not offering end-to-end encryption, among other issues. The company reacted by promising to add the security feature, but for paid users only. After some press backlash regarding that decision, Zoom has now announced that it will bring end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to everyone. </p>
<p> Conference calls and video meetings have almost been synonymous with Skype for the longest time, but Amazon is looking at changing that. Chime, a new Amazon Web Services platform, wants to simplify communications between teams and individuals and cater to their different aspects in one app: video call, voice call, chat, and screen sharing. </p>
<p> Chime is now available on Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows. According to Amazon, the service was built from the ground up with mobile in mind, so the apps work well on phones and let users seamlessly transition from and to their desktops. There are a few other advantages to Chime, like the lack of any long pins (meetings ring up like a phone call), quick options to get out of a meeting or let others know you're running late, a view of all participants and their current status, the possibility to mute one specific person's microphone if there's too much ambient noise around them, and the ability for anyone to share their screen without too much hassle. </p>

<p> You may remember way back when in May of 1920 2020 that Google made its relatively new enterprise-focused videoconferencing program Meet free for anyone to use. Everyone would be able to make free calls of unlimited length* through September 30. Well, just a day ahead of its expiration, the company has decided to extend that grace through March 31, 2021. </p>
<p> Zoom has grown to become one of the most popular videoconferencing apps, boosted by a sudden need to virtually keep in touch with close ones, co-workers, and clients during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the app's most popular features is the ability to add a virtual background, which is a nice way of keeping a modicum of privacy, especially when working from home. Sadly, this particular feature was not available on Android, but a new update just brought the functionality along with a bunch of other useful ones to our handheld devices. </p>

<p> Video doorbell 2 </p>
<p> If you're looking at adding an extra layer of security and convenience to your home, video doorbells could be a good idea. Unfortunately, such products are usually quite expensive, but you can save $76 on a new Ring's Video Doorbell 2 from Rakuten thanks to this coupon. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi video doorbells are much more convenient than traditional ones in the sense that they let you keep an eye on your front door wherever you are. However, it can be painful to look for your phone or tablet when someone rings the bell, which is why they're a lot more practical when used in combination with a smart display. Buying both can quickly break the bank, though, but thanks to this deal, you can get a free Echo Show 5 with the purchase of a Ring Video Doorbell 2, which saves you about $90 on the device's retail price. </p>
<p> With the summer holidays coming up, you might be looking at adding an extra layer of security to your home. If you're on the market for a smart doorbell, you can buy Ring's second-generation video doorbell for almost half the original price by getting a certified refurbished unit from Amazon. </p>

<p> video editing </p>
<p> As the corporate fate of social video platform TikTok remains hazy, the technical side has been going about business as usual and is out with a new if basic feature: users are now able to stitch parts of others' video into their own remix post. </p>
<p> OnePlus added video editing features to its built-in Gallery app back in 2018, and that included the ability to edit slow-motion video. But, in a change which slid under most people's radar, the ability to edit slow-motion video was pulled from the OnePlus Gallery app last month. Don't grab your pitchforks just yet though, because it sounds like the feature should make a quick return. </p>
<p> Sometimes pictures aren't enough to capture a moment, and videos are best to record a scene. However, we don't always want the surrounding sound to be captured, especially if it's just unnecessary noise. Unfortunately, it's not necessarily convenient to remove the audio track from a video with your phone, but Google seems to be working on making this a breeze. </p>
<p> Many of Google's recent products place their focus on mobile, which often comes to the detriment of the desktop experience. Google Photos has been plagued by that problem—after bringing an improved movie editor to Android and iOS, Google left the Photos web client without any editor at all. However, Google just added editing capability to the web interface, bringing its features more in line with those of mobile. </p>
<p> Adobe Premiere Rush for Android was launched just two months ago, giving people an instantly popular option for editing video without lugging along a laptop. However, as you would expect from most apps when they first launch, Rush lacked some of the desirable features found in some mobile editors and most desktop editors. Today's update will fill in one of the most requested features: Speed adjustments. </p>
<p> "Run and gun" has become a mantra for many YouTubers and filmmakers these days. It doesn't matter if you're a travel vlogger or directing a short film, you're probably eager to begin cutting together footage on the ride back from the field, not waiting until you're back in the office (or at home). There are plenty of good video editors available for Android, but none of them offer a seamless transition between working on a smartphone or tablet, then moving to a desktop to do finishing work. Today, Adobe is bridging that gap with the launch of Premiere Rush for Android. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 6 has more than a few advantages over the company's previous hardware, which is to be expected, given it's the latest model. But, a handful of the phone's smaller benefits are now trickling down to older handsets via an update to the OnePlus Gallery app. Rolling out now, the app update is bringing some of the OP6's video editing tools—including slow-motion video editing, background music, and general clipping/trimming—to older phones. </p>
<p> Last year, Google Photos treated iPhone and iPad users to a new, vastly improved video editor. Heavily based on the Clips app originally developed by Fly Labs and acquired by Google in 2015, the basic controls for working with multiple source videos in a timeline were much easier to see and use than other editors of the time, including Apple's own iMovie app. It has been a little more than a year since it launched on iOS, and now the new movie editor is rolling out to Android users. </p>
<p> Instagram is about more than showcasing what you had for dinner. Since 2013, users have been able to upload videos to the hugely popular photo sharing service, and now Instagram has announced that it's increasing the maximum length of these from 15 seconds to a whole minute. </p>
<p> iOS and Android users will be able to share longer videos starting from today. This will gradually be rolled out to all users over the coming months. </p>
<p> According to Instagram, the change is due to a surge of people engaging with video content, with time spent watching videos through the app having increased by more than 40 percent over the past six months. </p>

<p> If you're psyched for the Adobe MAX virtual conference, beginning today, you're probably looking forward to some of the new features and improvements coming to the likes of Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and others. While the big names are obviously leading the show, there are also some pretty notable updates rolling out to Adobe's mobile video editor, Premiere Rush. This update brings new motion effects, a bunch of free graphics and audio, and a new interface for browsing that content. </p>
<p> Telegram is still gunning to be the best messenger app around, and even though a major v6.0 update landed just two months ago, Telegram's development team apparently hasn't stopped to take a break. Today the app began rolling out new features on both Android and iOS, most notably an editor for videos. </p>
<p> It takes a lot of applications to build an ecosystem. Google has all the essentials down — email, calendar, contacts, productivity applications, and so on — but the company has always struggled with creative tools. Most notably, Google is still lacking a proper video editor for its own operating systems, which is becoming even more of an issue as high-end Chromebooks gain momentum. </p>
<p> Video editing is often a very demanding task for mobile devices, which means it can be difficult to find a fully-featured editor that delivers an acceptable experience. Sure, there are many options to choose from on the Play Store, but it can be tough to dig through the cruff while looking for the perfect solution for your editing needs. Luckily Magi+: Magic Video Editor is here to help. Not only does it bring along a bunch of special effects, but you can easily use these effects to create amazing visuals that otherwise wouldn't be possible without a Hollywood budget. </p>

<p> YouTube has been the biggest video-sharing site out there for many years, but that doesn't mean that everything about it is good. Two of those not-so-good things include the Video Editor and photo slideshows, which are both sparingly used. For that reason, YouTube is discontinuing the use of these two features after September 20th, 2017. </p>
<p> Quik lets you select photos and videos from your device's storage or Google Photos library, then it analyzes them and automatically trims the best moments from videos and focuses on faces to reframe photos. You can still do that manually though if you prefer. Quik </p>
<p> These days, GoPro is the king of the hill for action and aerial photography. Sure, you could wrap some tape around your phone and send it up on a quadcopter or toss it into a sandwich bag and hope it doesn't spring a leak at the bottom of the pool, but those are terrible ideas—seriously, don't try them. Since you won't be putting your phone (or tablet) through near certain destruction, why not use it instead to edit those great videos? GoPro announced that it has acquired popular mobile video editing apps Replay and Splice. Both apps are currently iOS exclusives, but the company has plans to bring them to Android later this year. </p>

<p> Video games have long been associated with negative connotations about wasting time and killing brain cells, but a new game might just help to change that.

<p> The Forza video game series is widely known as an Xbox exclusive, but that's about to change with Turn 10's latest release, Forza Street. Xbox has just announced that Forza Street is available on Windows 10 today, and that it'll come to Android and iOS later in the year. </p>
<p> When I was younger, video game tips came in one of two forms: a Nintendo hotline that you could call to get someone to walk you through the game, or you could find a written guide in one giant doc with some kind of ASCII art at the top. You kids today get all the nice stuff. Like video walkthroughs delivered directly to your phone or tablet via Break Media's new GameFront app. </p>
<p> The app is completely free and has access to tons of videos covering a variety of games for various platforms. The walkthroughs are curated, so it's not just a random assortment of links to YouTube clips. </p>

<p> Stadia has been steadily improving since launching last year, including getting the Stadia controller to work wirelessly in web browsers. Now, four new games have been announced for the cloud gaming platform, with two titles from Thunder Lotus Games coming this month and DIRT 5 and CHORUS dropping in 2021. </p>
<p> Before the days of Twitch, or even Justin.tv, YouTube was the one place we all went for gaming content. Whether they were Let's Plays of games that were out of our reach, guides on how to complete quests or boss battles, or lore videos that dove deep into a game's story, YouTube was the place to find it all. In 2015, the company launched YouTube Gaming to combat the rising popularity of Twitch. It also ended up being a testing ground of sorts for things like a dark theme, Super Chat, and Channel Memberships. But in a weird turn of events, the popularity of the service (according to YouTube, at least) is leading to its shutdown in March 2019. </p>
<p> If you're below a certain age or simply not all that familiar with the history of video games, perhaps you haven't heard about Postal. Originally released for the PC in 1997, Postal was an isometric top-down shooter - think Contra with some better graphics. Postal was, by all accounts, a fairly unremarkable game; its mechanics were simple and its story was rudimentary. What made it notable was its intense violence and the depiction of the "gone postal" protagonist shooting defenseless civilians. </p>
<p> Playing video games is for losers, apparently - these days all the cool kids watch other people play video games. Twitch, the platform of choice for your non-video game-playing needs, has updated its Android client with a few handy features in version 3.2. Both of them come straight out of YouTube's bag of tricks, but that's OK - every video player should let you do this stuff. </p>
<p> The first thing you'll notice is that Twitch now has a pop-out mini-player that lets you browse for a new stream while watching your current one. Press the channel button in the top left-hand corner of the fullsreen video to go back one step, where said video will minimize into a ribbon at the bottom of the screen. </p>
<p> Have you noticed that it's impossible to search for a game-related video on YouTube without seeing dozens of hour-long "Let's Play" videos? You're not the only one. According to a report from The Daily Dot, Google is looking to re-make YouTube's live streaming service (the one you use for every official Android event) with a focus on video games. The report cites anonymous sources "within the streaming industry," so it's firmly in the rumor department for the time being. </p>

<p> While there's no way to confirm the report, it certainly makes sense. </p>
<p> A friend once told me that watching someone else play a game can sometimes be even more entertaining than playing it yourself and more enjoyable than a movie. I wouldn't know, but I trust his opinion. Well, his and that of the thousands of people who seem to love it as much, to a point where a game streaming platform like Twitch exists and is valued equally to Instagram. If you fall in this demography of video game lovers and if you're a fan of the multi-million dollar competitions that ensue, you should check out Strafe. </p>
<p> Think of Strafe as a sports scheduling and scores application, only it's geared toward eSports, ie. video </p>
<p> When you search for certain artists, movies, or figures, Google sticks a card within the results that displays background information all in once place. This way you can potentially get what you need without having to click on a single link. Recently the company started giving video games this same treatment. </p>
<p> When you search for a particular title, Google will toss up such details as a brief history, the developer, release dates, and supported platforms. It will also supplement this text with screenshots. These Knowledge Graph cards show up on desktops and mobile devices alike. </p>
<p> Information appears for games spread across various platforms, including indie PC titles, console hits, and mobile games for Android and iOS. </p>
<p> As a dedicated gamer and a former cash-starved teenager, please listen to me: don't shop at GameStop. The ubiquitous American video game retailer is almost certain to overcharge for software and hardware, underpay you for trade-ins, and try to squeeze three preorders and a Game Informer subscription out of you before you leave. But for those misguided souls who insist on giving them custom (or who live in a city with no retail alternatives), the official GameStop app has been notably updated today. </p>
<p> Updated app above, old one below. </p>
<p> The update text on the Play Store simply says "everything," and based on cached images of the previous version, that's not an understatement. </p>

<p> videolan </p>
<p> VLC, the video player that can handle practically anything you throw at it with no config tweaking, has been updated to version 2.5, marking the first update to the stable channel of the popular media player in over a year. In addition to a lot of interface tweaks bringing it more in line with Material Design guidelines, visual changes have also come to Android TV and Auto. </p>
<p> Following VLC on Android over the last couple of months has felt a little bit like a shell game. It all started in December when VideoLAN declared VLC was finally leaving behind its Beta status. The app retained the same package name, org.videolan.vlc.betav7neon, but was to be considered stable. Earlier this month, a brand new version 1.0 VLC app appeared in the Play Store with a package name and title devoid of the word 'beta.' This new app was to become the channel for stable releases, while the original listing was again repurposed for beta releases. This only lasted a few days before the new version vanished from the Play Store on devices and ceased to be installable from the web, at least for many of us. </p>
<p> It seems like we've been waiting forever for an official build of VLC to land in the Play Store, and that day has finally come... for some people, anyway. First off, the build that just landed in the Store is for devices with ARMv7 NEON CPUs only. This includes most modern processors, like Tegra 3, Exynos, OMAP4, and Snapdragon S2, S3, and S4. If you have an older processor, like Tegra 2 or one that uses ARMv6 architecture, then a build for your device should be available "in a few days." </p>
<p> While this version is beta, it still supports all the features that users of VLC's desktop software have come to expect, like playback of nearly any video or audio file, media library, support for multi-track audio and subtitles; as well as some mobile-specific goodies like auto-rotation, aspect ratio adjustments, and gestures to control volume. </p>
<p> The incredibly popular VLC Player is finally coming to Android after months of hard work by the open source project developers. Originally a desktop media center for Linux, Windows, and Mac, this versatile player will bring many new video-playing features to our beloved OS including a wide variety of formats such as DivX and Dolby TrueHD. The lead developer in the project, Jean-Baptiste Kempf, has confirmed that it will hit the Android Market in "just a few weeks", which means that Android will be the first mobile platform to have a version of this software finally follow iOS and get its own port (thanks, Mikeyy). </p>

<p> The Duo team began rolling out v26 today, but this one doesn't have any obvious changes, so it may be a service update. A teardown is also fairly sparse, mostly calling back to some older topics, including the upcoming feature for sending video messages when connections can't be made on the spot, the removal of some camera adjustments used in development, and the start of H.265 testing. Since there's not a lot of meat to most topics, they'll be kept pretty short. Of course, if you stumble across anything new, let us know in the comments! </p>
<p> The latest version of Duo began rolling out to users this morning, but there haven't been any visible changes popping up in the live app. As is tradition, especially with Duo, a teardown does turn up a few of the changes we can look forward to in the future. This time, we're looking at yet another camera effect, but this one may actually stick around and make it to users. There is also follow-up on some previous camera effects and the voicemail / videomail feature discussed in previous teardowns. </p>
<p> Hot on the heels of Allo's update over the weekend, Duo is now out with a new version of its own. Like Allo, its adaptive icon has been retouched to get rid of the infamous dinner plate look. While there aren't any other changes to the app on the surface, a teardown provides us with clues that Duo may support signing in with and being contacted through your Google account. </p>
<p> There's a new version of Duo rolling out today, but it doesn't bring any huge changes for users. However, a teardown shows that the developers are still plenty active as they work on some tools to experiment with camera effects, including new controls for adjusting brightness, contrast, and saturation. Also in this update are new details for a voicemail-like feature for sending voice and video messages outside of a call. </p>
<p> What's New </p>
<p> While the meat of this post is in the teardown, one visual change in this update also stands out. Missed calls have been redrawn to place the icon below a contact's name, and if the call was made in the last day, it will list the time instead of a nonspecific "today" label. </p>

<p> video messages </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/08/19 5:30pm PDTon Aug 19, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/22 5:08am PDTon Oct 22, 2020. </p>
<p> We aren't at the point yet where every Android phone is able to transcribe voice calls in real time, but what Google is doing with its video chat service Duo is a good first step: the app is now enabling captions for recorded voice and video messages. </p>
<p> Whether your reaction to the brand-new decade is excitement, fear, or entirely understandable anxiety, now you have one more method of expressing that emotion to others. At least, if you use Google Duo. Google's video messaging app has just added support for emoji-based reactions. 🎉 </p>
<p> You've been able to send video messages on Google Duo since March. The current implementation isn't particularly elegant, though; it's more like leaving a voicemail than intentionally sending a message. The app will receive an update this week that simplifies messaging, eliminating the need to call your recipient before sending. </p>
<p> We've been anticipating the official launch of screen sharing in Duo for about many months, ever since a teardown in mid-October revealed it to be in development. We've even seen basically what it looks like, albeit just as a sample. Now with the rollout of v34, we can all begin sharing our screens with friends, or more likely, help our parents fix something that's not working on their phones. Well, we could try to do that, except screen sharing is kinda totally broken. </p>
<p> Telegram is my favorite messaging platform. It's secure, ubiquitous across operating systems, and feature-rich. More things get added all the time to the service, such as voice calls and themes, that bring it closer to its competitors like WhatsApp. V4.0 has landed and it brings a few things of note. </p>

<p> Most of us know MX Player as the best video player on Android, able to handle any file format, codec, bitrate, or subtitle extension. What you may have missed though is that MX also has an on-demand movie and TV show streaming service in India. It's now expanding availability to seven countries, including the US and UK. </p>
<p> BET's on-demand streaming service, BET+, has launched, and it's got apps for both Android and Android TV ready right out of the gate. The service is a collaborative effort between BET Networks and Tyler Perry Studios, and features content principally by black creators. </p>
<p> Epix is the latest cable network to get hip to its industry dying. As such, it's launched Epix Now, a standalone streaming service that offers access to its library of content on demand for a pretty fair price: $5.99 per month. </p>
<p> Netflix has released its fourth-quarter 2014 financial results along with a letter to shareholders, posting both to its website. These documents show plans to increase its amount of original content, rapidly expand internationally, continue its DVD-by-mail service, and more. </p>
<p> First, some numbers. Netflix picked up 13 million new members in 2014, an increase from 11 million the year before. The video on demand provider now boasts 57.4 million subscribers, and it expects to end the first quarter of the new year with 61.4 million. </p>
<p> Earlier this year, Netflix raised its price from $7.99 to $8.99, a move it believed cost it subscribers throughout the months that followed. </p>

<p> video playback </p>
<p> The YouTube app’s player interface has started to look cluttered with tens of options and icons crammed onto a tiny mobile screen. Google has been trying to alleviate the situation a bit lately by adding a few neat gestures that cut down the number of taps required. Joining this list is a relatively new gesture that lets you exit fullscreen videos with a single swipe. </p>
<p> We recently learned that the Pixel 3 is pretty good at shooting video, and it turns out that it's not bad at playing video back either. The Pixel 3 XL supports 1440p60 HDR playback, a step up from the Pixel 2 XL's 1080p60 HDR maximum. </p>
<p> Some major changes for the YouTube Android app appear to be coming down the pipeline. Several readers have reached out to us with screenshots and video documenting substantial tweaks they noticed when firing up the app. </p>
<p> MX has always been a pretty impressive video player - it's chocked full of useful features and offers nearly every codec imaginable. Today, it received an update to v1.7 that brings a fair amount of performance improvements for various devices, as well as one really neat key feature: background playback. </p>
<p> Changelog: </p>
<p> Stabilized S/W decoder on Tegra 3 devices such as ASUS Transformer Prime, HTC One X, Nexus 7. </p>
<p> Added new hardware decoder named H/W+. (However, H/W+ decoder is available only on limited devices) </p>

<p> video player </p>
<p> MX Player is one of the most popular apps for playing back media content on Android devices thanks to features like picture-in-picture playback and Chromecasting local files. In the latest beta release, the app is implementing several new additions including pinch-to-zoom and in-app YouTube browsing. </p>
<p> One of the things that first struck me about MX Player, when I tried it out many years ago, was its swiping gestures on each side of the screen. Instead of looking for physical volume buttons or pausing the video to find the brightness controls on my phone, a simple swipe would adjust those without skipping a second. These same gestures are now available in Android's built-in video player. </p>
<p> VLC is one of the best media players. It's available on pretty much any platform and able to play almost every audio and video file type you could think of. Its UI on Android has become a bit stale over the years though, so with the recently released version 3.2.3 of the app, the developers have decided to polish up the looks while also adding new features to the Android TV and Chromebook variants. </p>
<p> As one of the most popular and fully-featured video player apps available on the Play Store, we've become accustomed to MX Player getting useful new features on a regular basis. Most recently, the team behind it added Chromecast support for online streaming content, and the latest update includes a Picture-in-Picture function. </p>
<p> If it were up to us, every video would be 16:9, with some exceptions made for some more cinematic footage. But because there are older videos and people unaware of vertical video syndrome on YouTube, videos with inferior aspect ratios are an unfortunate reality. The team behind YouTube is making the best of this situation and has now forced its web player to adapt to different aspect ratios. </p>
<p> Chrome 65 came out last week, and included Google's new ad-blocker and a few other security features. Chrome 66 has now graduated to the beta channel, and has several major experimental features. There's a new 'Modern Design' interface, partially based on the ill-fated Chrome Home UI, as well as updates to the media player and a new Clipboard API. </p>
<p> The video player on Chrome for Android has always closely mirrored (or looked identical to) the desktop Chrome video player. There's a play/pause button, a timeline, and whatever other controls the site has enabled (full-screen, volume, download, etc.). A brand new video player has appeared in Chrome Dev and Canary, with the same double-tap to fast-forward/rewind that the YouTube app added earlier this year. </p>
<p> Plex has been up to lot lately; it wasn't too long ago that the company announced Live TV, a free service for all Pass subscribers. Shifting back to a stronger Android focus, the app is getting a rather interesting update starting today. V6.0 (technically, 6.0.1.523) adds the ability to play locally-stored video files on your phone or tablet. </p>
<p> YouTube's update to v5 introduced its floating in-app video player, giving users an easier way to browse for a new video while finishing up whatever they were just watching. While the YouTube developers are known for experimenting heavily with interface adjustments, the floating video player has gone basically unchanged over the last four years. That is until a few weeks ago when some users found themselves looking at a new bottom bar layout equipped with player controls. But that's not the only thing YouTube is considering, there is also evidence that users will have the option to shut off the floating video player altogether, or only leave it on while connected to Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> VLC, the desktop favorite of local video enthusiasts for more than a decade, doesn’t have quite the same kind of universal acclaim on Android. But the developers are still hard at work making improvements. According to a blog post from Geoffrey Metais, the 2.1.0 update to the beta release adds a ton of new features, notably including compatibility with Android Auto (for audio, not video). </p>

<p> A new version of the Google app began rolling out earlier this week, but there don't appear to be any major changes going live quite yet. However, this version does bring some big clues about upcoming changes. On the docket for this teardown is a new authentication step for purchases made through Google Assistant, video previews in search results, user-defined actions take form through IFTTT, and some people will be happy to find out that Google's launcher won't always add icons for newly installed apps. </p>
<p> God bless its heart, Microsoft is trying hard to keep its apps updated and interesting on Android. Some of them are quite popular (50M downloads and above) while others like Bing Search are... hanging on. But that's not for lack of effort. </p>
<p> In the latest Bing update, there are quite a few nice video features being sprinkled in. You can preview videos inline (with sound off) in the search results. You can also tap videos after doing a music search to play them synchronously with the lyrics. And there is a new way to discover videos related to the one you're watching. </p>

<p> Google's Pixel phones may offer stellar still photography, but they've never been known to focus much effort on video. That seems to be changing with the release of the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G. Google is bringing a handful of new "Hollywood-inspired" stabilization effects that should make videos a lot more fun to capture: Locked, Active, and Cinematic Pan. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/07/06 6:30pm PDTon Jul 6, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/16 3:06am PDTon Jul 16, 2020. </p>
<p> The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has fundamentally changed how we all do business, take classes, and meet our family members. Many of our streaming apps have had to lower the video quality to spare some bandwidth for the more important stuff. Following Netflix’s lead, YouTube also began capping the video resolution to standard definition on mobile phones. What was supposed to be a temporary restriction for Indian users has now been in place for three months, affecting hundreds of millions, and there's no sign that Google will ease it anytime soon. </p>
<p> There's nothing worse than watching your favorite show and having it pause to buffer at the most intriguing moment. Unfortunately, commuters can experience this quite often, but Netflix is trying an unusual way to solve this issue. Indeed, the company is testing how it can improve video quality while a viewer is on the go by tracking their "physical activity." </p>
<p> YouTube for Android has had a few ups and downs in the last months as the native app was replaced by what is essentially a web wrapper (you can test it by going to youtube.com/tv) and dumped many features that were later slowly added back. The latest of the features to make it back onto the interface is the resolution adjustment selector that you can see in the screenshot above. Also rolling out is a new interface, but it doesn't appear to be live for everyone just yet. </p>
<p> YouTube usually updates your video's resolution on the fly depending on your connection speed, but if you want to manually choose a specific quality setting, you can do so now. </p>
<p> There's a reason we here at AP have a dedicated Verizon hero with devilish features grafted on: the company consistently makes changes that are unfair to its customers. After limiting video quality to 480p and 720p depending on the tier of unlimited plan back in August, Verizon has now brought full-quality streams back - for an extra $10 per month. </p>
<p> With so many things happening this week surrounding Google's new hardware, it's easy to overlook some of the software updates rolling out. The latest version bump to YouTube Music doesn't include much in the way of visible changes, but a teardown of the apk also reveals some worthwhile additions in the works for the future. As always, the apk is ready and waiting at the APK Mirror link below if the Play Store isn't already serving the latest version to you. </p>
<p> Many of Google's most recent updates have been relatively light on features, turning instead towards cleaning up bugs. However, that doesn't mean there aren't still new things in the works. A couple of recent YouTube updates have been preparing some new features and we've got a teardown to reveal what users can probably look forward to in the future. </p>
<p> Vine isn't a platform known for outstanding videography, on account of being limited to mobile cameras (not to mention the time limit). But starting today, users on Android should notice a definite improvement in the quality of uploaded videos, at least according to the latest app update. Of course, the quality will still be limited by your phone or tablet's camera and the shooting conditions in any particular location. Exactly how video quality is being improved (bitrate bump? Resolution? Post-processing?) hasn't been addressed. </p>
<p> The only other notable update is to the notification options. I'm not a regular Vine user myself, but the Settings menu now includes options to display Likes, Comments, Re-vines, Mentions, and Follows in either a semi-curated "tailored to you" fashion or from anyone. </p>
<p> For people who have a Comcast cable subscription, the Xfinity TV Go app is quite the nice piece of software. Rather than just providing shows for immediate streaming, which is less groundbreaking these days than it used to be, Comcast provides quite a few channels for live streaming. Now many more networks are available, including A&E, Cooking Channel, DIY, Food Network, HGTV, History Channel, MUN2 (companion to Telemundo), Sprout, Starz, TBS, TRUtv, TNT, and the Travel Channel. Aside from missing CBS, March Madness is pretty much covered. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, the experience could still be much better. There's no channel line-up, and the name of the currently playing network is about as much information as you're going to get. </p>

<p> video recording </p>
<p> Android 11 may not have had a lot of flashy new features, but at least we should credit it for fixing or improving some of the outstanding issues. Back in June, we examined a fix that had just rolled out in the first Android 11 beta that would lift the 4GB cap on videos captured by the camera. While the API that had previously been responsible for setting the 4GB limit was no longer a constraint, it didn't actually make a difference with the Google Camera app or most of the other popular video recorders tested. Now that Android 11 has rolled out and many of us with Pixel phones are running it, here's what has changed and how it works today. </p>
<p> Before phones started recording 4K footage, most people balked at the idea their videos could grow to 4GB and larger. Things have changed, of course, and it takes less than 15 minutes at 4K30p to hit that mark. You might be thinking this shouldn't matter thanks to 64-bit filesystems that can handle file sizes up to 16TB. However, an old API from the days of 32-bit Android still capped sizes at 4GB, which forced video recordings to be split into separate files at regular intervals. A fix for this was promised a while back and Android 11 Beta 1 finally delivers on this, but it's not going to matter if you're not using the right camera apps — and the Google Camera isn't one of them (yet). </p>
<p> Thanks to Google's pioneering role in image processing, Pixel phones are among the best when it comes to photography. That doesn't translate to video recordings, though, which are noticeably worse than the ones you can create with, say, an iPhone. Google has also chosen to limit 4K recording to 30 fps on the Pixel 4, citing a lack of interest from users, despite other manufacturers providing 4K 60fps without problems. It looks like the company might reconsider this decision, as evidence in a leaked Google Camera APK has surfaced that it might be working on a 4K 60fps mode. </p>
<p> Phone cameras have changed a lot in just a few years. Not too long ago, we were all recording VGA-resolution movies to send to friends and family, and now many flagship phones are capable of recording at 4K resolution and at higher frame rates. Android's camera application still won't save videos larger than 4GB, splitting long recordings into multiple files in the process, but that might finally be fixed. </p>
<p> A month ago, Google explained why it doesn't support 4K video recording at 60fps on its latest flagships (or any of its phones, for that matter): It said the majority of users stick with 1080p, so it'd rather focus on improving that mode and avoid large storage consumption by 4K 60fps videos. As it turns out now, there might be another reason related to the Pixel 4's Snapdragon 855 processor, which always pulls images from the two rear cameras at once. </p>
<p> Pixel 4 users had a moment of respite when a Reddit user claimed that his Pixel 4 gained the ability to record 4K 60fps video using an updated version of the Open Camera app — a recognized third-party camera app for Android. It turns out, the claim was nothing but bogus, and the app in question doesn’t go over 30fps no matter what frame rate you pick. </p>
<p> Despite the Pixel 4's multitude of new camera chops, you can still reproach it for a few missing features. It lacks a wide-angle camera, it doesn't have autofocus on the front cam, and Google still limits 4K video capture to 30fps. The company has clarified the reasoning behind the latter. </p>
<p> Pixel 3 bugs have been taking up far too much of our time recently, but thankfully this is one that is very easy to fix. Some users have been noticing that while recording video, their Pixel 3 will still vibrate for incoming notifications, causing the video to distort along with the buzz. This is something that should be prevented by default, and the solution is simple. </p>
<p> HTC isn't doing particularly well these days, and the few people out there who purchased a U12+ likely weren't too pleased with the last bit of news about their devices announced: 'CryptoKitties.' Luckily, HTC is releasing an update for the U12+, starting with the Taiwanese dual-SIM model and coming soon to US and European versions. </p>

<p> video resolution </p>
<p> One feature I wish YouTube had is an option to select a default resolution for video playback. My internet situation is so bad (WiFi is rather slow, 4G has a silly cap) that I always resort to 360p or 480p to avoid buffering or eating through my plan, so for now, I have to open the quality picker each time and choose the one I want. Those of you who are luckier than me had to do the same, only you'd be picking the highest quality instead. But things have now gotten a little easier for you and a little harder for me. </p>

<p> While you may have read our OnePlus 3 text review, you might be waiting for another take before pulling the trigger on the latest from the sometimes-controversial smartphone manufacturer. Well, another take is what we've got: Facundo Holzmeister takes it away in our video review of the OnePlus 3. </p>
<p> You've read our HTC 10 review, and now we're back with the video version with our ever-lovable video host Mark Burstiner. Mark takes a look at what makes the 10 tick, and if the 10 ticks the boxes it needs to in the increasingly cutthroat flagship smartphone game. HTC's latest device has been almost uniformly praised as the best smartphone they've released since the progenitor of the One series, the One M7, while still inheriting that vital HTC design DNA that made the original One such a showstopper. But is HTC's best good enough in 2016? That's a tougher question. </p>

<p> video sharing </p>
<p> Vine was the internet phenomenon that proved that short, easily digestible video clips could be tremendously popular and spark creativity. However, the rigid six-second format had soon been adopted and loosened up by Instagram and later TikTok, and after Twitter purchased Vine, it vanished into obscurity. An unceremonious death followed in 2016. But Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann still believes in the format and has been working on a successor for a long time. After an extensive beta phase, this new product, Byte, is now official and stable on the Play Store. </p>
<p> Despite YouTube's many problems, there hasn't yet been a site that can challenge its dominance. Vidme (better known as vid.me) launched in January 2014, and over the past year or so, has become one of the prime candidates for a YouTube alternative. Sadly, the site announced yesterday that it is shutting down. </p>
<p> Instagram is about more than showcasing what you had for dinner. Since 2013, users have been able to upload videos to the hugely popular photo sharing service, and now Instagram has announced that it's increasing the maximum length of these from 15 seconds to a whole minute. </p>
<p> iOS and Android users will be able to share longer videos starting from today. This will gradually be rolled out to all users over the coming months. </p>
<p> According to Instagram, the change is due to a surge of people engaging with video content, with time spent watching videos through the app having increased by more than 40 percent over the past six months. </p>

<p> YouTube is a lot of things to a lot of people, but for gamers, it's the ultimate cheat guide to every game, ever. If you can't figure out how Nathan Drake is supposed to get through that tower scene with the snipers or you're stumped over the pattern needed to survive 8 more seconds of Cup Head, you're going straight to YouTube. But depending on the game, you might have to sit through 20 painstaking minutes of slow gameplay to understand a strategy, or you might have to rewatch the same clip a dozen times to spot the timing needed for each move. </p>
<p> Earlier today, YouTube started enabling the Material Design YouTube site for everyone, and announced a new logo. But a few changes were also revealed for the Android app, which are included in today's YouTube 12.32.60 update. </p>

<p> Google's Pixel phones may offer stellar still photography, but they've never been known to focus much effort on video. That seems to be changing with the release of the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G. Google is bringing a handful of new "Hollywood-inspired" stabilization effects that should make videos a lot more fun to capture: Locked, Active, and Cinematic Pan. </p>
<p> Yesterday, we found out in a teardown that version 2.13 of the Google Photos app brings video stabilization. This is a welcome addition, of course, as nobody enjoys watching shaky footage, but how well does it work? Thanks to some comparison videos that were shared on the net, we can now see that it's pretty damn impressive. </p>
<p> There's nothing like adding great new features with an update. The latest version of Photos began its rollout yesterday and it enables a video stabilization feature we've been looking forward to for months. A teardown of the apk also raises the question: Would the Photos app ever find itself reintegrating Google+ in some way? If you're not in the mood to wait for this version to hit your device, hit the APK Mirror link at the bottom to get this update a bit early. </p>
<p> The recent theme for Google's app updates has been that they're not really packed with big new features. This isn't unusual, just part of the typical ebb and flow as development teams prepare for bigger things. The previous update for Google Photos wasn't loaded with many new features and the new one appears to have none at all. However, a teardown of v1.26 shows that there's still some work going on under the hood for the previously revealed video stabilization feature and hints at a new way to share photos with people that will be even faster than what we already have. </p>

<p> YouTube Red has been available for over a year in the US and has since expanded to New Zealand and Australia followed by Mexico. But there's a fifth country that has either gotten YouTube Red recently or will be getting it soon: South Korea. </p>
<p> According to Google's Support page for YouTube Red, the service is now available in "Korea," by which we presume it's South Korea, because rumors about the launch in the country have been spreading for a few months... and because launching in North Korea sounds just a little far-fetched.

<p> When you hear a song and don't know what it is, but want to find out, what do you do? Fire up Shazam or SoundHound, of course. But what do you do when you see a video that you're lookin' to identify? Well, there hasn't really been a solution on Android to handle this sort of debacle - until now, that is. </p>
<p> Calling itself the "ultimate video discovery" app, VideoSurf is a direct answer to the iPhone's IntoNow - it can identify videos through audio and video recognition, suggest other videos, and locate other videos using keywords. </p>
<p> With all the mind-blowing news coming in from CES 2011, it's easy to forget that interesting and innovative things are coming from other sources at the same time. Here is one of those sources. </p>
<p> A new service somewhat reminiscent of Shazam and Sound Hound has surfaced on our radar, but with one major distinction: this app does videos. Using proprietary algorithms and software (read: magic), newcomer Videosurf will not only help you identify what T.V. </p>

<p> Regular followers of HTC's customer relations will recognize Mo Versi, the company's vice president of product management. He often gives out helpful information on his personal Twitter account, explaining when notable updates are coming for HTC phones and even giving support answers one at a time to his followers. He's considered, in the somewhat insular circles of Android-focused tech blogging, a good dude. And yesterday he gave out some good news: the HTC One M9 Marshmallow update is scheduled to hit a handful of Canadian carriers on Monday. </p>
<p> Great news for our Sasktel, Rogers, Wind and Videotron HTC One M9 owners! </p>
<p> Looks like every carrier in Canada (give or take a couple) decided to announce GS4 pre-orders at the same time. The good news, though, is that if you're on Telus, Bell, Virgin, or Videotron, you're one step closer to landing yourself a shiny new phone. The device is available for pre-order on all four of the aforementioned carriers, with a shipping date of April 27th for the former three. </p>
<p> Customers on Telus and Bell will be able to grab this handset for $200 with a three-year agreement (yikes!); Videotron customers will see the same price, though there's no word on agreement terms in the PR. </p>
<p> If you travelled back in time to the middle of 2010 and asked your average Canadian about the selection of Android devices available to them, you would not be impressed with their answer - it seems that up until this year, the Android selection in Canada was about 6 months behind the curve. </p>
<p> Canadians, myself included, can now stop bemoaning their second rate options. As of today, two major new devices, the Nexus S and the Motorola Xoom, have been made available to those in the Great White North. </p>

<p> We've gotten a few sneak peeks over the past couple of weeks of what the Pixel 5 might look like in full. The indications are there to say that Google is completely done with the dual-tone back design. But one should never turn down a venture into an alternative timeline — so it doe looks like with this one picture of what appears to be a Pixel 4a 5G prototype from Vietnam. </p>
<p> Spotify has been working on proper lyrics support for ages. It likely takes this long to implement the seemingly simple feature in part due to licensing issues surrounding songtexts, which already led to a lawsuit against Google. Spotify seems to have finally found a suitable solution, as TechCrunch reports that the company is planning to roll out lyrics synced with music to 26 markets today. The US, Canada, and the UK aren't among these, though. </p>
<p> Google took the unusual step of confirming the existence of its upcoming Pixel phone this year, but we don't expect the full Pixel 4 unveiling for another month. That hasn't stopped some people in Southeast Asia from getting their hands on the phone. We have no idea what they're saying, but you get a good look at the phone in these videos. </p>
<p> According to a report earlier today published by Nikkei Asian Review, Google is planning to move some of its Pixel production to Vietnam, escaping both rising Chinese production costs and US government's escalating trade war with the country. Google has already started renovating a former Nokia factory for the purpose, and currently plans to shift some Pixel 3a production there by the end of the year. </p>
<p> We love news of Google Assistant adding more language support. This means more people can talk to this digital helper in their native tongue, extending its reach and usefulness. Today sees one more language being supported: Vietnamese. </p>
<p> Developers with apps on the Play Store can set up promo codes to give users a paid app or an in-app product for free — if they live in an eligible country. But the list of countries where developers can issue Play Store promo codes is expanding at a quick pace. Seven countries (Argentina, Chile, Peru, Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, and Romania) were added to the fold in the past few weeks alone, and now four more countries are part of the list: Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam. </p>
<p> Spotify has just launched in Israel, Romania, South Africa, and Vietnam, bringing the total amount of worldwide markets to 65. So if you live in one of those four countries and you've been patiently waiting to become one of 159 million users worldwide (or you're lamenting the loss of Spotify Dogfood), it's your lucky day. </p>
<p> Google Play carrier billing is expanding to more carriers around the world, as per an update to the support page. Some of the newly listed carriers may have been offering the option for a while (but weren't mentioned in the page), others may be about to add it soon, but the official word is out now. </p>
<p> For those of you in the US, the one added operator is Boost Mobile. But there's great news for a few more countries as well. Here are the newcomers: </p>
<p> Luxembourg: Orange </p>
<p> Beside Indonesia, which adds support for Vodafone on top of Indosat, Telekomsel, and XL/AXIS, the 5 other countries are seeing direct carrier billing available for the first time through these new operators. </p>
<p> It's always a happy day when one of Google Play's entities rolls out to new countries because it means more users will be able to benefit from the entertainment options that were available to others before them. But it's especially a happier day when one of said countries is Lebanon, because I live there and because we're usually one of the last countries to get anything from Google. </p>
<p> But today we're celebrating because Google Play Movies has officially landed in Lebanon and 10 other countries. All of them are Middle Eastern, except for Vietnam — Chào! Here is the full list: </p>
<p> Slowly but surely, the creatures are coming. They advance, nation by nation, relentless, refusing to stop until the entire planet is their domain. Hundreds of millions have felt their impact. Politicians and titans of industry are not immune. And even mainstream news outlets are scrambling to find "22 Tips For Catching Pokémon - #12 Will Make You Scream!" Today developer Niantic continues its bid for global mobile gaming domination by expanding Pokémon GO to 15 new markets in Asia, including hundreds of millions of new potential players on iOS and Android. </p>

<p> Google first revealed that Pixel pre-orderers would receive Daydream Views free of charge at last month's Pixel unveiling, and now, there's finally some movement; promo codes for the VR headsets are being sent out via email to customers who pre-ordered via the Google Store. </p>
<p> You know the routine - you're browsing Android Police, scrolling through our amazing content when you lie down in bed, only to have your phone go crazy. The narrow content you were scrolling through has switched from portrait to landscape view, even though the phone is still facing the same direction relative to your head as it was before. At best, you stand your phone back up, pull down your notification shade, and press the toggle. At worst, you navigate away from the app into system settings and dig around for the display options. Rotate on Shake is faster than both of these options. </p>
<p> Good news for you independent bloggers out there! WordPress just issued a small update to its mobile app. The biggest change is that you can now add featured images to a post. Featured images, of course, are treated differently in WordPress entries than in-line images and are often used as thumbnails, so it's been a bit of a problem that the app hasn't made it easy to add them until now. </p>
<p> Here's the full changelog: </p>
<p> What's new in version 2.2: - Featured image support - New stats view - Performance and reliability improvements </p>
<p> Unfortunately, WordPress doesn't get updated quite as much as one would like. </p>
<p> For those looking forward to 2012's playing of what is widely considered the oldest (and most well-known) tennis tournament in existence, the official Wimbledon app hit the Play Store recently, bringing live scores, results, schedules, and more. </p>
<p> The app, despite its somewhat all-over-the-place UI, provides a ton of functionality, not only giving users information about the games, but also about players – Wimbledon's official app gives users player profiles, video previews, highlight reels, features, interviews and "golden moments" photos. If that isn't enough, players can tune in to three "Live @ Wimbledon" radio channels – one providing general "Daily Coverage" and two channels dedicated to Centre Court and No. </p>
<p> Google unleashed a small round of updates today, bringing new features to both the Play Books and Street View apps. Play Books has been updated with a brand new UI for devices running Android 2.2/2.3, including the nifty 3D page-turning animation users of Books' tablet interface have come to know and love. </p>
<p> Users can also add home screen shortcuts for individual books, allowing you to jump straight into your favorite book without actually opening the app. The update also enables offline search, and ensures that your device's display will stay on during TTS. </p>
<p> Google Street View, on the other hand, got a slightly less major update (but an important one nonetheless) – the app now includes Ice Cream Sandwich's signature action bar and action-overflow button for those running Android 4.0+, bringing its interface into line with ICS' current design standards. </p>
<p> 911sniper has done it again - this time with a full RUU (full release firmware) from the upcoming EVO View 4G, Sprint's 4G-ified version of the now-available HTC Flyer (the latter is on sale now at Best Buy). </p>
<p> The hefty file weighs in at a staggering 522MB - and given the massive load that's going to be placed on 911sniper's mirror, we're going to try and get a copy of it up on our own high-speed mirror in the next hour (as soon as we finish downloading it), so that the community can get cracking on this thing. </p>
<p> Full RUU files allow developers to get their hands on what are often older flashable ROMs, which may contain unfixed exploits allowing rooting or bootloader unlocking. </p>
<p> If you have ever tried to do tech support for someone on the go, needed to remotely see how exactly somebody did something on their computer, or found it necessary to view another person's screen from your smartphone for some other reason, you're already well aware of the frustration that arises from not having your computer handy. Fortunately for you, you've got an Android phone, and I've got the perfect tool for you. </p>
<p> Join.me, a sweet program designed by those crazy screen-sharing, remote-controlling, virtual LAN-creating programaholics at LogMeIn, allows you to either share your computer screen or view people sharing their screens from anywhere. </p>
<p> The second of our HD videos from yesterday's Sprint press conference has finally been uploaded (no thanks to the ultra-crappy WiFi everywhere...). Once again, a quick recap of the specs: </p>
<p> 1.5GHz single-core CPU </p>
<p> 1GB RAM </p>
<p> 32 GB internal storage </p>
<p> Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), will be updated to Android 3.0 </p>
<p> Sense UI </p>
<p> WiMAX (4G) </p>
<p> Stylus </p>
<p> As mentioned in our hands-on with the EVO 3D, the View 4G features a new connector port dubbed MHL. It combines the functions of microUSB and microHDMI into one port. For more details, hit up our primer. </p>
<p> All things considered, the View 4G has potential in a lot of ways. </p>
<p> After the Sprint press conference officially ended, they quite literally pulled back the curtains to reveal a large viewing area, with a team of Sprint and HTC employees available to demo the HTC EVO 3D and View 4G. While we weren't allowed to get our mitts on the EVO 3D, we were allowed to play with the View 4G a bit. In both cases, the employees on the floor provided a quick hands-on of the devices. We managed to snag some HD video of the demonstrations for both devices, as well as a few photos. </p>
<p> The rumor mill has been abuzz with gossip about Sprint's CTIA event lately, and if BGR's sources are to be believed, the speculation was spot-on: the conference will indeed be centered around the HTC EVO 3D and EVO View 4G, with a WiMAX version of the Motorola XOOM making an appearance as well. </p>
<p> EVO 3D </p>
<p> First up, we have the EVO 3D - HTC's first foray into three-dimensional territory - which will reportedly feature: </p>
<p> A 4.3-inch qHD (960x540) autostereoscopic 3D display </p>
<p> 4GB of RAM (I'm thinking this is a typo - even powerhouses like the XOOM and the Atrix only have 1GB of RAM) </p>
<p> 1GB of ROM </p>
<p> A 1.2GHz Qualcomm 8660 Snapdragon CPU </p>
<p> Dual 5MP rear cameras; dedicated camera button included </p>
<p> Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) with HTC's Sense UI </p>
<p> Blockbuster on-demand </p>
<p> EVO View 4G </p>
<p> Just as expected, the EVO View 4G is almost exactly the same tablet as the (admittedly underwhelming) Flyer that HTC demoed at MWC. </p>

<p> View20 </p>
<p> Since Samsung unveiled the Infinity-O display, anticipation has been building for notchless phones with what's become known as the hole-punch camera cutout. The View20, from Huawei sub-brand Honor, was unveiled in Paris today for the European market after debuting in Hong Kong at the end of 2018. From a purely aesthetic point of view, it's certainly refreshing. The 4.5mm camera hole might not be quite as inconspicuous as Honor's marketing materials would have us believe, but it's got to be better than a notch, right? </p>
<p> The other major selling point of the View20 is that it's the first phone to ship with a 48MP camera sensor — the Sony IMX586 CMOS — with tiny 0.8 μm pixels. </p>
<p> Coming off the back of a dark year for smartphone design, the View20 is a reason to be optimistic. Notched phones have never been aesthetically pleasing nor functionally ideal, but thankfully that design trend is on its way out. We’ve seen a number of novel attempts to produce bezel-free phones, including sliders and motorized pop-ups, but a few of the big players have decided there's another way. </p>
<p> Samsung's upcoming flagship Galaxy S10 series will most likely feature hole-punch cutouts in the screen — an Infinity-O display to use the Korean company's terminology — and there will also be handsets from Nokia, Motorola, and Huawei using similar panels. </p>
<p> Late last month we saw the first glimpse of a real phone with a "hole-punch' front camera (i.e. a camera cutout entirely surrounded by screen) in the form of the Huawei Nova 4, and now we're learning that sub-brand Honor is about to release the View20. As well as the new screen design, it's one of the first smartphones to include a 48-megapixel rear camera. </p>

<p> View 4G </p>
<p> HTC acknowledged the vulnerability in some of its devices that Android Police together with Trevor Eckhart posted Saturday night. The privilege escalation vulnerability currently allows a potentially malicious app that uses only the INTERNET permission to connect to HTC's HtcLoggers service and get access to data far exceeding its access rights. This data includes call history, the list of user accounts, including email addresses, SMS data, system logs, GPS data, and more. </p>
<p> Sprint subscribers, you can stop holding your breath now - the nation's third-largest carrier has officially announced the release date of the EVO 3D and EVO View 4G. The duo will be coming out of HTC's factories and landing in a Sprint retail store near you on June 24, just as we've been hearing from the rumor mill. </p>
<p> The three-dimensional sequel to the hugely successful EVO 4G will set you back $199.99, a decent price considering what's under its hood: </p>
<p> Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) with HTC Sense 3.0 </p>
<p> 4.3-inch qHD (960x540) glasses-free 3D display </p>
<p> 1.2GHz Qualcomm MSM8660 dual-core processor </p>
<p> Dual 5MP rear cameras capable of 1080p video recording </p>
<p> 1.3MP front-facing camera </p>
<p> 1GB of RAM </p>
<p> 4GB of internal storage </p>
<p> WiMAX connectivity </p>
<p> Meanwhile, the EVO View 4G - the CDMA version of the Flyer - will cost $399.99... </p>
<p> Well, looky at what Engadget got a hold of - a leaked internal document from Sprint's Reward Me site that just so happens to show a possible release date for the HTC EVO View 4G (the WiMax version of the HTC Flyer). Have a look: </p>
<p> As you can see, the View 4G should hit shelves in on June 24th (and no, that's not the price listed beside it ), which happens to be same date that the EVO 3D is rumored to be landing on the Now Network as well. </p>
<p> HTC Flyer, also known as the HTC View 4G in the U.S. on Sprint, is one of the more interesting Android tablets coming out within the next few months, due to its superfast 1.5GHz processor, a perfect for many (as the Nook Color and Galaxy Tab showed) 7" size, palm rejection technology, and the Scribe digital pen. </p>
<p> Sure, we got a few hands-on here and there, but nobody can be as good as HTC itself at highlighting the best features of the tablet, at least until we get our own review units. </p>

<p> Sometimes it seems like YouTube is perpetually testing different interfaces for its Android app. Based on reports we've received recently, yet another set of modifications is being tested. The latest round of tweaks is on the subtle side: some are seeing the thumbnails for individual videos in the Home tab show view counts, with more space for video titles and the channel logo repositioned below. </p>
<p> Google is imbuing the Street View app with some clever new features in its latest update. This version adds automatic face detection for 360 photos for quick blurring, groups together unpublished 360 photos by place or time, and adds a share link to user profiles. Additionally, a teardown shows that there's a new feature on the way that will clue in ambitious users about nearby places that should be photographed. </p>
<p> What's New </p>
<p> Official Changelog: </p>
<p> Unpublished 360 photos will now group together based on place or time. </p>
<p> Automatically detect faces for blurs in 360 photos. </p>
<p> Almost anyone who uses YouTube regularly has seen a video with either 301 or 301+ views, according to the player. Why is this? Well, Google automatically checks videos crossing this threshold of views to see if the visitors are legitimate or just bots designed to pump up the number. From now on, they are tweaking the method to count "real" views in real time and only holding off on adding those that YouTube is unsure about. </p>
<p> Stopping at a low-ish number like 301 kept a video with fake views from looking too popular. </p>

<p> Before I get your hopes up, no they haven't improved spreadsheets yet. However, that is on the way. What is arriving now, though, is the ability to add comments to your documents, view tables, and improved Google presentations viewing support. You'll even get speaker notes and the ability to swipe between slides. </p>
<p> There are more features on their way. Here at Android Police HQ, we've been eagerly awaiting proper spreadsheet editing (which is currently horrible to an unusable degree), and Google has seen fit to name check that very feature in its "More to come..." </p>
<p> You may remember Pixel Qi, an ambitious display maker looking to provide users with brilliant displays that not only save energy, but which are actually readable in sunlight. Since we covered their 7" and 10.1" displays way back in May, the company has continued working, announcing in a blog post yesterday a new display which "matches the resolution of the iPad3 screen, and its full image quality including matching or exceeding contrast, color saturation, the viewing angle, and so forth with massive power savings." </p>

<p> Instagram is a social network built around sharing photos. In 2015, the service introduced the ability to share video clips. Now it's about to implement another way of determining how popular those videos are becoming. </p>
<p> Right now, the only feedback uploaders can go off are the number of likes and comments they receive. Soon, Instagram will introduce view counts. </p>
<p> Google Maps is arguably the best way to get from point A to point B, but it is also one of the best ways to explore places around you. From restaurants, to movie theaters, to state parks, Google Maps has all the information you could ever need. How does Google have information for all of these places? Surely there can't be a couple people sitting in Mountain View documenting every mom and pop shop in the world. </p>
<p> Photo Sphere product manager Evan Rapoport, who also manages Maps, Street View, Views, and Panoramio, had one more tidbit of Google Camera-related news to convey today. In a post to Google+, Rapoport announced that photo spheres had gotten a major boost to 50MP (about 11776x5884 pixels). This is up from around 8MP in the previous app, and the results are beautiful. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/viewsonic-2/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17561811" filename="viewsonic-2">
<p> Chrome OS is all the rage in education these days. It's ideal for classroom use, with sandboxed security, low-cost and durable hardware options, and plenty of management tools. Viewsonic is no stranger to the education market, either, with its wireless ViewBoard classroom displays. And now it's pushing out a Chromebox to accompany that display, the new $349 NMP660 which will be available in April. </p>
<p> We heard just recently that ViewSonic was launching a 22" tablet/display running Android. Today, we get a look at this display. We've also learned that it's running a dual-core TI-OMAP processor, 1GB of RAM and Android 4.0, and a 1920x1080 display underneath the gargantuan screen. The demo seems to be targeted at being used in a classroom setting, with plenty of child-friendly apps and videos, but that's just bundled software. The display, which starts at $479, could be used by any budget-conscious consumer that wants to try using Android instead of Windows as their primary OS for a shared family device. </p>
<p> Viewsonic, a US-based purveyor of various display technologies and mobile products, teased its "Touch and Connect" series prototypes today, reports Engadget. </p>
<p> The Walnut, California manufacturer teased several products, perhaps the most stunning among them being an Ice Cream Sandwich powered "tablet" with a (are you ready?) 22-inch display. </p>
<p> With such a gigantic display, this tablet will certainly blur the lines between monitor, tablet, and television display. ViewSonic seems to be fine with such ambiguity however, having lovingly labeled the device a "smart business tablet monitor." </p>
<p> While approximately zero details were revealed by today's teaser, more information should be available at Computex this June. </p>
<p> ViewSonic, a leader in making affordable gadgets, have intro'd yet another entry level tablet: the ViewPad E70. Under its hood, the 7-inch E70 screams budget in ever single way, as it houses a 1GHz processor, 4 geebees of storage, a microSD card slot, and an HDMI output capable of streaming 1080p video. </p>
<p> The real story of this budget-gadget isn't the specs, though - it's the software. The E70 will be running ICS out-of-the-box, which is a more than a lot of high-end devices announced thus far can say. It's not all good, however - take a look at the design: </p>
<p> Let's just ignore the fact that the bezel is practically an inch thick and look a little closer -- do you see the issue? </p>
<p> In spite of all the exciting pre-CES announcements we’ve been seeing over the last few days, one company has been preparing a somewhat less-than-enticing device – specifically, ViewSonic with a new low-end handset that’s been dubbed simply the ViewPhone 3. </p>
<p> While this won’t be Viewsonic’s first foray into the low-end Android market, it will be the company’s first US smartphone – and let’s just say it won’t exactly be sparking a revolution. Have a look at the specs that have been made official thus far: </p>
<p> 3.5-inch display (unknown resolution, but don’t expect miracles) </p>
<p> Described by ViewSonic product manager Mike Holstein as a phone for the “value seeker,” the ViewPhone 3’s perhaps single defining feature is its price tag: $250 – off-contract. </p>
<p> In a move that will certainly irritate many people, ViewSonic has taken to its Facebook page with an official word on the gTablet, future support, and whether or not it will ever officially see Honeycomb. As you may have already guessed, the simple answer from ViewSonic to the latter is "no," with very little reasoning behind the decision. </p>
<p> The ViewSonic gTablet was one of the first Android tablets to hit the market with the NVIDIA Tegra 2 chipset onboard, but at the time of release it was powered by Android 2.2, as 3.0 had yet to hit the market. Naturally, early adopters of the device assumed that Google's tablet specific operating system would eventually make its way onto the gTablet... </p>
<p> If you've been looking for a 7 inch tablet without the bells and whistles of the HTC Flyer or the newly announced ASUS Eee Pad MeMO 3D, then it looks like ViewSonic may have your number, as it has just announced its newest Honeycomb tablet: the 7-inch ViewPad 7x. </p>
<p> ViewSonic ViewPad 7x </p>
<p> The ViewPad 7x is pretty cut-and-dry as far as Android tablets are concerned - just in a smaller package. It's packing a 1GHz Tegra 2 processor under its hood, along with a 7 inch, 1024x600 display, HDMI out, microUSB, and support for HSPA+. </p>
<p> ViewSonic 10Pro </p>
<p> If the 7x isn't your thing, however, ViewSonic has also announced a second tablet - the 10 inch, Intel Oak Trail sporting 10Pro. </p>
<p> Update: It's up for sale yet again today, Saturday, May 7th. </p>
<p> Woot.com, Internet's favorite a-deal-a-day site that I personally religiously check daily, is offering up an Android tablet deal today that may be hard to pass up for those looking for a beefy, yet budget, Android tablet. </p>
<p> The very hackable ViewSonic gTablet, which sports a speedy dual-core 1GHz Tegra 2 CPU, a 10.1" 1024x600 TFT display, a front-facing camera, 512MB RAM, 16GB ROM, and USB host capabilities, is sitting there for the next 12 hours (or until it's sold out) for the very low price of $279.99 + $5 shipping. </p>
<p> Some of you may remember that daily deal site Woot marked the Viewsonic gTablet down to just $280 (twice). Amazon (Woot's parent company) has decided they'd like to do the same, so for the third time in just a few weeks, you can score the dual-core, Tegra2-rockin' tablet for only $280. Although it's sold through Amazon, the order is fulfilled by Woot. </p>
<p> Need a refresher on the specs? No worries, I can totally play it lazy and copy-paste what we've said before: </p>
<p> The very hackable ViewSonic gTablet... sports a speedy dual-core 1GHz Tegra 2 CPU, a 10.1" 1024×600 TFT display, a front-facing camera, 512MB RAM, 16GB ROM, and USB host capabilities... </p>
<p> Back on March 23, Woot featured the Viewsonic gTablet as their deal of the day, selling the tablet for just $285 out the door. It sold out then, but it looks like they managed to get their hands on a few more, as it's the deal of the day once again. In typical Woot fashion, the description is hilarious (it's the same one as last time) - just check out the first paragraph of the product description: </p>
<p> There are already plenty of side by side comparisons to help you decide between a ViewSonic gTablet and an iPad. </p>

<p> viewsonic tablet </p>
<p> Last week, we found out that Viewsonic would be rebranding and selling a 7" and 10" tablet; the 7" tablet would be Android while the 10" would dual-boot Android and Win7. Now Engadget has a hands-on preview of the 10" with additional details, and suffice it to say there are some ups and downs. </p>
<p> Bad news first, though: the tablet runs Android 1.6. The reason for this lies in the CPU used, but that doesn't make shipping a tablet with an OS that's over a year old suck any less. </p>
<p> A few weeks back, Viewsonic announced they'd be bringing a few Android tablets, to IFA (Android tablets at a trade show? Shocking, I know). Specifically, they'll be showing off two tablets - one is 7" and rocks Android, and the other is 10" and dual boots Android and Windows. They'll both be released under the ViewPad name, and they're slated (get it?) to feature: </p>

<p> Adobe Photoshop Express has added a handful of useful new features. In an update this week, the mobile photo editor got the ability to automatically adjust the perspective of wonky photos with a single tap, as well as a vignette slider and a couple of quality-of-life improvements. </p>
<p> Today's a good day for mobile gamers to open up their wallets. Max Payne, which David rated as having the highest possible nostalgia-to-dollars ratio, is 67% off today in the Play Store, clocking in at $0.99. Not bad. Looking for a better deal? How about Crystal Defenders? Developed by Square Enix (you know, the Final Fantasy guys), the game is normally $7.25, but for right now it's only $1.26, for a massive 83% off. Given the quality of Square Enix games, this is a fantastic deal. </p>
<p> Of course, Google is probably behind this, as each of these games include a reference to an 'End of Summer Sale' in their descriptions at this time. </p>

<p> Verizon is possibly pushing out an over-the-air update v4.03.605.1 to the HTC Rezound which only just received ICS (v3.14.605.12) last week. The 104MB update is pretty hefty for only a few weeks of work, which has puzzled many XDA members and made things turn pretty ugly in the relevant thread. The reason I'm saying "possibly" is only one person at XDA has received it so far, which may indicate there's some sort of soak testing going on. </p>
<p> We've been hearing information about the HTC Rezound (codenamed Vigor) for quite a while now, and HTC just officially took the wraps off of this beasty. Like most other new HTC devices, it's packed with Beats by Dre, and, similar to the Sensation XE, has those wicked red capacitive buttons. It's quite impressive in terms of hardware spec: </p>
<p> 1GB RAM </p>
<p> 16GB built-in storage, 16GB microSD card </p>
<p> HTC acknowledged the vulnerability in some of its devices that Android Police together with Trevor Eckhart posted Saturday night. The privilege escalation vulnerability currently allows a potentially malicious app that uses only the INTERNET permission to connect to HTC's HtcLoggers service and get access to data far exceeding its access rights. This data includes call history, the list of user accounts, including email addresses, SMS data, system logs, GPS data, and more. </p>
<p> There's no doubt that we're all waiting with anticipation for the HTC Vigor, which is rumored to be coming out as the Droid Incredible HD, to hit the market. It's reportedly going to be the first full HD phone, sporting a 720p display, 1.5Ghz dual-core processor, 1GB RAM, Sense 3.5, and Android 2.3.4 -- in other words, it's going to be a beast. </p>
<p> For those who want to get a little taste of what the Vigor has to offer before this upcoming HTC monster is officially released, we have gotten our hands on all of the multimedia goodies from the device. </p>
<p> Since an anonymous NenaMark revealed the HTC Vigor's alleged specs, the Android community has been waiting to hear more about the powerhouse supposedly heading for Verizon. Yesterday, some new info about the Vigor came in the form of blurrycam photos posted by the folks over at Droid-Life. </p>
<p> For those who may have forgotten, here are the Vigor's rumored specs: </p>
<p> Qualcomm Adreno GPU </p>
<p> 1.5GHz processor </p>
<p> Android 2.3.4 </p>
<p> No doubt the Vigor is looking like a powerful and sleek device, one which we're eagerly waiting to learn more about. </p>
<p> Get ready, Verizon customers. IGN just leaked Verizon's alleged 2011 roadmap, and, unsurprisingly, it features Android quite heavily. While there aren't too many details on any of the devices outside of what we already know, it will give you a good general idea of what to expect from Verizon this year: </p>
<p> Samsung Stratosphere: Previously rumored as Verizon's version of the Samsung Galaxy S2, the Stratosphere is listed as a "4G Smartphone w/Android 2.3." </p>

<p> Nearly a year ago, Google added the ability to play content from partner services through your Google Home. For example, you could say "Play The Office on Netflix," and your Home would cast the show to the Chromecast/Cast-compatible TV of your choosing. At launch, only Google Photos and Netflix were supported, but the list of compatible services has been slowly growing. </p>
<p> In my tiny little corner of the world, we get very few perks with any of our mobile plans. No unlimited calls, no unlimited texts, and lots of limited data. That hasn't stopped an enterprising local music service from convincing carriers to offer an unlimited streaming plan only on their app for a small fee. That goes to show that people may not care about calls or texts anymore, but there's always room for offers when it comes to entertainment. </p>
<p> T-Mobile has been trying to pioneer that area in the US and (politics and legalese and execution aside) has managed to get really good deals for customers who might be interested in them. I </p>

<p> vimeo </p>
<p> The Vimeo app has been around since 2012, but it has always been aimed mainly at watching video rather than creating it. That changes with the latest update, which finally adds recording and live streaming inside the app. Just fire up the integrated video camera, and you're all set. </p>
<p> The dream of an open and free internet isn't dead. Net neutrality — the principle that internet service providers must treat traffic equally, regardless of the source — is still seeing a strong fight waged on its behalf. This week, a group of 23 attorneys general from across the U.S., led by New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood, published a new brief reaffirming its dedication to the cause. </p>
<p> Material Design isn't some immutable standard. It's a flowing, breathing, evolving design. As our own former editor Liam (now a Googler) pointed out today, the current expressions we've seen of Google Material are just one potential way to implement the changing design philosophy. So if you're eager to check the possible futures for Google's Material designs, you should probably watch this video. </p>
<p> Instant Apps were first announced over a year ago at Google I/O 2016. Put simply, when tapping on search results from a supported site, a minimal version of the site's app would quickly install and immediately display the content. For example, tapping on a Vimeo link would open the Vimeo app and the video would start playing. </p>
<p> Users of Telegram, there's a great update to the app available. This new version brings a few big changes, including some Android-specific ones. The most notable ones for the messaging service as a whole are IFTTT integration and conversation pinning. Sounds cool, right? </p>
<p> Sometimes app developers surprise us with a big push of new versions and features after leaving us in the cold for the longest time. The Vimeo team, for example, had an ugly mess of an app for years until an update to version 2.0 last December completely rewrote it from scratch and made it several folds better. That was followed by the addition of Chromecast support in version 2.1 in February, and now another update to 2.2 is introducing offline videos. </p>
<p> When you start watching any video inside the Vimeo app, you'll see a new download icon in the overlay on top, which slowly breathes a blue hue to attract your eyes. </p>
<p> When Vimeo got its much needed interface revamp update at the end of last year, plenty of things got better in the app. It was faster, smoother, less of an offense to good design, and generally really better. However, it was missing an important feature for any Android video streaming app: Chromecast support. </p>
<p> At the time, we were told that we'd have to wait until Q1 2016 for Chromecast support to be built into the app, and lo-and-behold, the team is honoring its original timeline. Version 2.1 of Vimeo is live in the Play Store and it enables you to cast all videos to your big TV screen instead of watching them on your small phone's display. </p>
<p> The Vimeo app is one of those famously bad apps that actually make a mediocre mobile website look good by comparison. After years of being behind the curve, Vimeo is finally stepping up its app game with a v2.0 update. There's a lot of good stuff here, but you'll have to wait a bit for all the pieces to be in place. </p>
<p> Even with a major infusion of horsepower with devices like the NVIDIA SHIELD and Razer Forge TV, the biggest thing holding back the Android TV platform is a scarcity of apps compared to more mature alternatives like Roku. It looks like Google is quickly trying to close the gap: in addition to the announcement of HBO Now (currently exclusive to Apple hardware) at Google I/O, a handful of high-profile and formerly unavailable apps are also making their way to Android TV in the near future. </p>
<p> NVIDIA's SHIELD announcement post makes explicit mention of HBO Go (which is essentially the same thing as HBO Now, but for more conventional cable subscribers), FX Now, Fox Now, Fox News, EPIX, WWE, UFC, Vimeo, Qello, Vudu, and Twitch. </p>
<p> Popular video sharing service Vimeo has finally launched its official Android app today. The new app has included all the important features found in the web version, including the ability to browse, watch, download, and upload videos onto Vimeo. </p>
<p> Upon starting the app, the user is shown a 3x3 grid of options for creating, uploading, watching, and sharing videos. While not a requirement, creating a Vimeo account and logging into the service also allows the user to comment on, "like", and subscribe to videos, as well as save them to the "Watch Later" list. </p>
<p> Some of the other features of the app include: </p>
<p> Upload raw footage or previously edited creations in HD or SD </p>
<p> Pause/resume uploads and get reminded when a video is paused </p>
<p> Replace existing videos </p>
<p> Edit titles, descriptions, tags, privacy settings, and credits </p>
<p> Share videos via Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, WordPress, Email, and SMS </p>
<p> Watch and manage all Vimeo videos and download them to camera roll </p>
<p> Watch videos from your Vimeo Inbox, Watch Later queue, and videos you like" </p>
<p> Easily like videos, comment on videos, and add videos to your Watch Later queue </p>
<p> Discover new and interesting videos curated by Vimeo Staff </p>
<p> Add videos to Groups, Channels, and Albums </p>
<p> Access stats on daily plays, likes, and comments </p>
<p> Although the app has received some favourable reviews, the overwhelming majority are 1-star. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/vine/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549139" filename="vine">
<p> vine </p>
<p> Vine was the internet phenomenon that proved that short, easily digestible video clips could be tremendously popular and spark creativity. However, the rigid six-second format had soon been adopted and loosened up by Instagram and later TikTok, and after Twitter purchased Vine, it vanished into obscurity. An unceremonious death followed in 2016. But Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann still believes in the format and has been working on a successor for a long time. After an extensive beta phase, this new product, Byte, is now official and stable on the Play Store. </p>
<p> As you may remember, Vine was a simple app with short looping videos. It gained immense popularity and was acquired by Twitter in 2013 but was unceremoniously discontinued late in 2016 amid strong competition from Snapchat and Instagram. If you're still mourning its loss, you'll be pleased to hear that the Vine founder is making another app. </p>
<p> Twitter ruffled some feathers when they announced that Vine would be discontinued, likely due to Twitter's native support for video and the lack of a revenue stream from Vine. At the same time, they announced that the Vine mobile app would be re-branded into 'Vine Camera,' which went live today. </p>
<p> Twitter launched the Vine video sharing app in 2013, and it was a moderate success. Other apps added similar quick video features, but Vine never seemed like a high priority for Twitter. The company announced today that it's discontinuing the Vine app in the coming months, but it's not deleting your Vines... at least not yet. </p>
<p> Twitter isn't just a place for spitting out sharp criticism and inane musings. Okay it is, but those expressions aren't limited to text. The social network allows for up to 30 seconds of video. </p>
<p> That limit is changing. Twitter is bumping up the max length of a video up from half a minute to 140 seconds. </p>
<p> I am no Vine watcher, but I've heard that there's a lot of cool content on the social network especially if you figure out which users are the most interesting to follow. Lots of creative people have found their niche within the constraints of its short video format and that's what everyone who's sticking around likes about it. </p>
<p> Now Vine is getting updated on Android to allow you, the spectator, to watch an entire channel from start to finish with a single button instead of manually moving from one video to the next. The option is visible in the latest version of the app when you open a channel: there's a new Watch button next to the Follow one. </p>
<p> Music and social media go together like teenagers and places their parents don't know about. Music became such a big part of MySpace, it inspired the likes of SoundCloud. Music videos regularly rack up the most views on YouTube. Chances are, your favorite artists have a Twitter account. </p>
<p> Musicians have used Vine as another way to get themselves noticed and share their music with a new generation. Now Vine intends to help them out. Today it's launching Snap to Beat, an easier way to toss together seamless perfect loops. </p>
<p> Video editing on mobile is still far from perfect - the complexity of the task and the limitations of a small touchscreen mean that getting anything done with precision is tricky. Apps with bite-sized editing like Vine are a good starting point, but we could use something to occupy the middle ground. Enter Redub, a video editing tool from developer Sumoing. It aims to bring a few much-needed tools (and an easy interface) to mobile video editing. </p>
<p> Sumoing first caught our attention with Repix, a better and more effective take on the Instagram formula. Redub takes the same approach to video: keep the simplicity of more limited apps... </p>
<p> Vine is... OK, let's be clear here: Vine is kind of useless. There's literally nothing you can do with Vine that you can't already do with YouTube, unless you count an arbitrary 6.5-second time limit. That being said, there's no reason that Twitter can't improve its property, and it has done just that by boosting the video quality. Newly-created Vines from iOS are now defaulting to 720x720 pixels. Look down there: you can see all the retriever's little golden hairs. </p>
<p> While you can check out the fancy new high-quality Vines on the announcement post, for some reason the developers decided that Android users didn't need the update quite as much as iPhone users did. </p>
<p> Vine, the video equivalent of Twitter, has received an app update that brings in a number of tools that should make getting content onto the site a better experience. The update drops a new icon at the bottom left that lets users pull up videos from their gallery (referred to annoyingly in the app as a camera roll), preview videos of any length, and trim footage down into a 6-second version that probably doesn't do the original any justice (ahem, I mean, make them Vine-ready). </p>
<p> In addition to the aforementioned features, users can mix videos together and perform more actions on their clips. </p>

<p> If you have an affinity for vintage cameras, you may find yourself toting around a light meter to make sure every exposure comes out just right. If you happen to also be a Glass explorer, David Young has a solution for that - Google Glass Light Meter, a piece of Glassware that entered Google's official collection just a few days ago. </p>
<p> As you may guess from the name, Light Meter turns your Glass unit into... </p>
<p> It wouldn't be a new month without a roundup of the previous month's best Play Store offerings. Of course, we've already taken a look at the best new apps from February 2013, but games – as usual – were also well-represented by new entries last month. </p>
<p> Typically, we try to narrow down our list of the top new apps and games to five entries each month. This month, however, saw the debut of plenty of new games that are definitely worth taking a look at, and have included seven of the very best games no Android gamer should miss. </p>
<p> When I first covered Pixlr Express a few days ago, I noted that the presence of a photo editing app was odd in Autodesk's lineup of powerful tools. Having developed apps like ForceEffect, 360 Mobile, and AutoCAD WS, you'd think Autodesk was marketing to power users who want to design, edit, animate, and engineer from the palm of their hand. Still, Autodesk's first foray into the mobile photo editing world – Pixlr-o-matic – was a hit. </p>
<p> Autodesk, known for polished, highly functional software like AutoCAD, and apps that allow users to build, manipulate, animate, and plan from their Android device, also found a hit with its Pixlr-o-matic app, an image editor that primarily touted its ability to create "cool looking vintage images." I always thought a vintage filter app was a little out of place in Autodesk's otherwise power user-oriented lineup, but it was still a fun app for quick antique-ification of your mobile photos. </p>

<p> You can get vinyl skins from dbrand that make your phone look like wood, metal, or just very bright vinyl. Now, you can also get skins that make them look transparent thanks to a partnership with YouTuber Zack Nelson. You probably know him best as the disembodied voice behind the JerryRigEverything durability test videos. The skins are only available for a limited time, and there apparently are "dozens" of easter eggs. </p>
<p> The Discogs app landed on the Play Store in 2016. Version 2.0, out now, features a number of improvements, including the new ability to explore the Discogs Database without starting at a specific search and better VinylHub integration that lets you view participating retailers' record selections from in the app. </p>
<p> If you're big into vinyl (records), then you probably recognize the name Discogs. If you aren't, it's a music marketplace for cataloging your collection and buying new albums. And, today, Discogs has released a beta that allows you to make purchases from inside the Android app itself. </p>
<p> You know those adorable little Android collectables made by Andrew Bell and Dead Zebra? Well, you can head over that way and buy yourself an early non-denominational holiday festival present. Dead Zebra has opened "The Vault," which is stocked with leftover Android minis from old sets and heavily discounted units with slightly jacked up packaging. </p>
<p> Many of you have been asking how you could get your hands on those little Android guys that you can usually see hanging out in my reviews. Like these ones here: </p>
<p> I've personally acquired them over time - at Google I/O, the Lookout party, and Dead Zebra itself (no, you can't have mine!), but that's not the only way. </p>
<p> A good friend of ours, Omar Trujillo, also known as @0mie, partnered with us to promote his official vinyl figurines store where you can pick up authentic, Google-licensed, Dead Zebra-designed vinyl Android figurines and give them a new home. </p>

<p> Feel free to change the channel if you've seen this one before, but the widely used SeriesGuide app has disappeared from Google Play. This piece of phone and tablet-friendly software is great for tracking which episodes and series you've watched and keeping up with new releases. Earlier today the developers sent out a tweet alerting users to the app's removal. </p>
<p> SeriesGuide was removed from Google Play for violation of its Content Policy. </p>
<p> Among all the awesome (or really bad, depending on your mood) April Fool's jokes today, Google's web form for submitting Android Market copyright infringements towers above all, especially considering it's not a joke, at all. We really doubt that it's intentional because this behavior was present before April 1st arrived to California, and it is mind boggling that something like this would fall through the cracks and get past Google's Quality Assurance. </p>
<p> You would think that large hardware manufacturers, such as HTC and Motorola, would dedicate at least a few hours to trademark searches before naming their products and investing millions of dollars into promotional efforts for said products. That would be a fair assumption, right? It seems like the answer sometimes is: not exactly. </p>

<p> Video games can often be a source of escapist fantasy... and not always fantasy of the "save the princess" variety. Party Hard, released last year on SHIELD and on SHIELD this summer, falls squarely into the second category. This visceral stealth game is about a Jason Voorhees-style serial killer methodically murdering his partying neighbors. Now there's a mobile version for phones and tablets too, going for $7 with no in-app purchases. Needless to say, it's not for kids. </p>
<p> The original Hotline Miami is a love letter to top-down action game excess, marrying tight and lightning-fast controls to neon-soaked, pixelated 80s aesthetics. (Oh, and that movie Drive.) It's a game that everyone should try at least once, if only to prove that you can make a modern game with old-school aesthetics, but keep enough innovation to make the whole experience seem fresh. On Android Hotline Miami is exclusive to the SHIELD, SHIELD Tablet, and SHIELD TV, and so it is with the sequel, Wrong Number. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got several PC and console pilgrims including Hotline Miami, War Thunder, and Always Sometimes Monsters, a new Portal-inspired Zen Pinball table, a mashup of tactic, RPG, and city-building, and standard platformers and puzzlers. </p>
<p> Earlier this week we reported on Google's decision to refuse an Android port of the PC shooter Postal in the Google Play Store. Two days later, a representative of developer Running With Scissors told us that Amazon had done the same for the Amazon Appstore, and provided us with the rejection letters from both companies. Google refusing to allow the controversial shooter onto the Play Store is merely inconsistent; as we noted at the time, games with similar levels of violence like Grand Theft Auto III are easily available. But Amazon blocking the sale of the Android app, when the company sells the same game as a PC download, was just downright hypocritical. </p>
<p> If you're below a certain age or simply not all that familiar with the history of video games, perhaps you haven't heard about Postal. Originally released for the PC in 1997, Postal was an isometric top-down shooter - think Contra with some better graphics. Postal was, by all accounts, a fairly unremarkable game; its mechanics were simple and its story was rudimentary. What made it notable was its intense violence and the depiction of the "gone postal" protagonist shooting defenseless civilians. </p>
<p> I was seven years old when Carmageddon first hit store shelves in 1997. Even if the game hadn't been widely banned and censored around the world, I still wouldn't have gotten my hands on it. The off-the-wall violence and bloodshed would have been a bit too much for my parents to permit me to play with good conscience. While leagues of long-time fans poured money into the Kickstarter campaign that allowed Stainless Games to port the game to Android in the first place, I am visiting the game for the first time. Thank you, Kickstarters, for giving me the chance. To anyone considering giving Carmageddon a try - don't think, just buy. </p>
<p> Wonderful news for the roughly everyone on the planet who plays Shadowgun: Deadzone: a whole bunch of new stuff is rolling out today! Notably, there's the Gangs feature which allows you to create groups of friends to play with. There are also a couple new maps that you can explore. And by "explore" I mean "kill things in." </p>
<p> There are also new weapon upgrades, some additional hats (because every game has to have hats now, right TF2?) and bug fixes and tweaks all over the place. Here's the full changelog: </p>
<p> What's in this version: </p>
<p> ☣New Features: * Two New Maps * New Weapons Upgrades * Chat in Main Menu * Gangs (Play with Friends) * New Hats * Rewards for finishing Zone Control or DeathMatch * Player Rank increased up to 50 now ☣ GamePlay Tweaks: * Redesigned Weapons Stats * Weapons&Gadgets Are Limited by Ranks ☣ Bug Fixing: * Improved Hit Detection * Fixed VoiceChat * Fixed Network Code * Renderer Optimization * Fixed Wall Exploits in Several Levels </p>
<p> As a side note: I love the radioactivity symbol for bullet points, Shadowgun developers. </p>
<p> I don't know about you, but when I think of the holidays, my mind immediately jumps to gang violence, prostitutes and M ratings. Which is great for me, because Grand Theft Auto III (normally $4.99) and Max Payne Mobile (normally $2.99) are both on sale for just a dollar each on the Play Store right now. God bless us, everyone indeed! </p>
<p> If you decide to buy these games, be sure to clear out plenty of space on your device. Grand Theft Auto III is a 1GB download, and Max Payne Mobile clocks in at 1.33GB. So, grab a glass of egg nog, hop on WiFi, put on Die Hard and have yourself a merry little Christmas. </p>
<p> When you're creating a game, there are a few key things you need to include: a good atmosphere (be it an intriguing story or just some wildly immersive effects), good gameplay mechanics, and a good hook. What's going to grab the users' attention? Well, for Gears and Guts, all three of those requirements can be summed up with "driving cars into zombies." Oh, and did I mention there's a sweet soundtrack to go along with it? </p>
<p> This game ditches any attempts at a story and simply plops you down in a nice little town that's being overrun by the undead, hands you the keys to a muscle car and says "Now have fun." </p>
<p> Here at Android Police, we trade in awesome games. Gingers getting chased by the grim reaper? Check. Apes summoning lightning from the sky? Check. Zombies taking shotgun blasts to the face? Check. A kid playing around in his room when he should be doing his homework? Okay, they can't all be winners. But here's one that is sure to melt your face off: an adorable kitten fighting fields of bunnies. What's that? You don't see what's so awesome about that? Here. Let me show you: </p>
<p> Yes, that's right. These bunnies are terrorists (seriously, some even have bombs strapped to their chests), and our hero, Marbles, has an arsenal of weaponry with which to obliterate the little bunnies. </p>

<p> SwiftKey is a fan favorite keyboard replacement for Android. Enthusiasts, though, know there's always a better SwiftKey out there. The current beta, named SwiftKey 3, is currently being put through its paces by the community, and yet another iteration has rolled out that brings some marked improvements to the input alternative. </p>
<p> Among the improvements: </p>
<p> Improved prediction algorithms </p>
<p> Better, more consistent punctuation key behavior </p>
<p> Smarter Smart Space functionality (which will make it easier to enter email addresses etc) </p>
<p> A refined experience in Google Chrome Beta </p>
<p> Fixed missing predictions on the longpress of @ and .com </p>
<p> At the end of CES, right after the barrage of almost 100 Android tablet announcements, SwiftKey teased us with a new version of its popular keyboard, specifically targeting tablets. The company later officially announced the new product, complete with a Tron-like, mysteriously glowing UI. The split-key design, especially useful for larger tablets, looked like a real winner to tablet owners. </p>
<p> Today, the first beta of SwiftKey for Tablets v2.0.0.36 was released to VIP members in the SwiftKey forum, and, of course, I immediately took it out for a spin. </p>
<p> After weeks of frantic coding, SwiftKey, my favorite smart aftermarket Android keyboard, just released a private beta to all registered VIP forum members. While the beta itself (v1.98.1.172) is private and we can't provide you with a download link, what we can do is list all of the improvements and tease you with some screenshots. </p>
<p> Update: While we can't promise anything, our friendly contact at SwiftKey who I just spoke to indicated that technically if you did apply for the VIP program (i.e. </p>

<p> Whether you have a few minutes or more than an hour to kill, there is no denying the entertaining value of online videos. They can be anything from educational to comedic, fascinating, or just cute. The problem, however, now that everyone has a camera and an internet connection to upload their masterpieces, is finding good content. </p>
<p> Sure, you can launch the YouTube app and search for a few keywords, play the highest rated or most viewed videos, and enjoy. </p>
<p> Samsung is sure throwing some big bucks behind promoting its flagship tablet, the Galaxy Tab. Just like the first video from Andes in the Extreme Retreat series, Extreme Retreat- Sahara manages to be hilarious and informative at the same time, showcasing the Tab's portability, versatility, and functionality. Just watch: </p>
<p> Wait, isn't an Android already superhuman or not human at all? Anyway… these videos were posted by a YouTube user DROIDshortcuts, most likely one of Motorola's marketing handles, and then sent over to us by the folks from M80 - a company that works with Motorola on promotions for the Droid. </p>
<p> These videos, shot in an amateur style, are actually quite funny and well made. </p>

<p> Securus Technologies is a Texas-based company, specializing in providing and monitoring calls to prison inmates. Securus came into the spotlight earlier this month, when a former Missouri sheriff was found using the company's service to repeatedly track people without a warrant. The New York Times reports that between 2014 and 2017, former sheriff Cory Hutcheson used the service at least 11 times, allegedly tracking a judge and members of the State Highway Patrol. </p>
<p> Securus obtains tracking information through a company called LocationSmart, which in turn has agreements with most U.S. carriers. Earlier this month, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote a letter to various carriers asking them to independently verify that these requests are made lawfully. </p>
<p> Virgin Mobile has been a popular pre-paid wireless carrier in the United States for a while now, using Sprint's network as a backend. As with most carriers in the US, both iPhones and Android devices were available to customers. However, Virgin has now partnered with Apple and will only offer iPhones moving forward. </p>
<p> It looks like budget-focused Sprint subsidiary Virgin Mobile USA is taking a page out of T-Mobile's book. Starting on Friday, the carrier will allow users to access certain streaming music services without taking the requisite hit to their data caps. The selection is a bit paltry at the moment (and notably lacking in both Google Play Music and Apple's Music service), but fans of Pandora Radio, Slacker, and iHeart Radio should be glad to hear that they can listen to practically unlimited amounts of music while they're out and about without incurring an extra charge. </p>
<p> Virgin Mobile is also reshuffling its phone plans. </p>
<p> A few years ago getting Internet access while on an airline flight seemed like magic. Now in the not-too-distant future, the connection in your plane might be faster than the one in your home. According to a press release issued by Virgin America, new technology from corporate partner ViaSat will improve its satellite Internet connection by a factor of five to ten times thanks to a next-generation satellite. The new technology offers speeds of up to 140 gigabits per second spread across the entire network, which should mean "8 to 10 times faster" speeds for individual users, enough for reliable music streaming and (maybe) some video. </p>
<p> Virgin Media TV customers in the UK, you can now watch your TiVo live television service or recorded programs on your Android device, anywhere! Anywhere with a WiFi connection, that is. Assuming that you've got a phone or tablet running Android 2.3 through 4.3, but not KitKat 4.4. Oh, and you can't be rooted. Have fun! </p>
<p> All kidding aside, there seem to be some serious issues with Virgin's new TV Anywhere app for Android, starting with the aforesaid KitKat support. Other early reviews are decrying the lack of support for older, non-TiVo Virgin DVRs and the rooted device restriction, which American football fans can probably sympathize with. </p>
<p> Looks like Sprint's underling companies have been busy working on bringing the first taste of 4G to the pay-as-you-go market. Piggybacking off of Sprint's 4G WiMax network, Virgin Mobile and Boost Mobile will both begin offering one 4G-capable smartphone each on May 31st: the HTC EVO V 4G on Virgin and the EVO Design 4G will be representing all that WiMax has to offer on Boost. </p>
<p> HTC EVO V 4G </p>
<p> The EVO V appears to be some sort of rehash of the EVO 3D: </p>
<p> 4.3-inch qHD display </p>
<p> 1GB RAM </p>
<p> 5MP rear shooter with 3D imaging, 1.3MP front camera </p>
<p> 4GB internal storage, microSD card slot </p>
<p> 1730mAh battery </p>
<p> Android 4.0 with Sense 3.6 </p>
<p> There's no word on processor or clock speed, but I'll be surprised if it's not the same 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon that's in the original EVO 3D. </p>
<p> Being an Android fan in Canada can be a mixed bag. While you may miss out on some of the sweet devices exclusive to U.S. carriers - the EVO 4G comes to mind - there's also the chance for some benefits, such as the recent July release of the international model of the Samsung Galaxy S II. </p>
<p> Thankfully, living at such northern latitudes won't cost us the opportunity to get our mitten-clad hands on the next Nexus device. While we have known this for a while, the details as to who will carry the Galaxy Nexus and when we can expect it to hit shelves have dropped today. </p>
<p> Back in July, Sprint announced plans to begin throttling speeds for customers who use more than 2.5GB of data in a month on its pre-paid subsidiary, Virgin Mobile. Naturally, this announcement did not sit well with Virgin customers, despite Sprint's claim that the change would only affect "3% of all data users." </p>
<p> However, the Now Network has decided to delay this throttling plan until sometime in 2012 to "ensure [they] have all the necessary systems in place so that [their] customer experience will remain positive." </p>
<p> There's no word as to exactly when this changeover will take place, but the company "will provide further information on timing beforehand so [their] customers have advance notification." </p>
<p> Remember how we ran that story last week about Virgin Mobile laying the smackdown on manufacturer UI overlays? We liked that. But Virgin Mobile wants the Android community to know that they shouldn't consider the prepaid carrier a safe haven for illicit activities like rooting or custom ROMs - not that that's any different from all the other carriers. Here's what Virgin had to say: </p>
<p> "We do not endorse in any way end users using a non-officially tested operating system nor do we approve of 'rooting' devices. This constitutes a violation of our terms of service and puts our network in jeopardy," a spokesperson said. </p>
<p> Virgin Mobile announced via an image upload on their Facebook page that they're landing the Samsung Intercept as their first Android phone. No word yet on pricing or release date, but we can't imagine it would be too terribly much (should be in the range of their LG Rumor Touch). </p>

<p> Newegg is one of the best places to buy electronics online, and we've posted countless deals from the store over the past few years. Internet-based stores have largely been exempt in the past from paying U.S. state taxes, but those legal loopholes are slowly being closed. B&H Photo recently started charging sales tax in almost all states, and now Newegg is following suit. </p>
<p> Writing for Android Police from my home office in Virginia, it's not every day that I get to report on something somewhat close to home. But here it is. A Virginia Circuit Court judge has ruled that while police officers cannot compel a person to give up their passcode, they can demand someone use their fingerprint to unlock their phone. </p>
<p> Judge Steven C. Frucci made the ruling this week, saying that giving a police officer your fingerprint is similar to providing a DNA or handwriting sample, something the law permits. Divulging a password or PIN, however, requires admitting or handing over knowledge, something that's protected by the Fifth Amendment (you have the right to remain silent). </p>
<p> You know the drill by now. It's time for some new LTE market announcements! Woo! Party hard. The network rollouts today are coming to Pennsylvania, California, Indiana, Virginia and Puerto Rico. This comes on the heels of Sprint announcing its intention to purchase the remaining shares of Clearwire that it didn't already own. </p>
<p> Here's the list of new cities: </p>
<p> Indianapolis/Carmel, Ind. </p>
<p> Santa Rosa/Petaluma, Calif. </p>
<p> Vallejo/Fairfield, Calif. </p>
<p> Southern Puerto Rico (including Ponce, Coamo and Guayama) </p>
<p> York/Hanover, Pa. </p>
<p> Franklin County, Pa. </p>
<p> Page County, Va. </p>
<p> Enhanced 4G LTE coverage around Shenandoah County, Va. </p>
<p> Not a bad set of additions. There is still much to be seen in regards to Sprint's LTE network rollout, particularly over the next year. </p>

<p> You may recognize this little guy from previous leaks of the so-called HTC Proto. The device looked very similar to the Desire V and, indeed, HTC's latest announcement is dubbed the Desire X. While it's no One X, the device does pack a dual-core Snapdragon S4. Unfortunately, it's not that one. This is the MSM8225 which still uses a 45nm architecture so it's not nearly as zippy as the S4 we all know and love from other, more high-end phones. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/07/01 9:12am PDTon Jul 1, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/02 10:34pm PDTon Jul 2, 2020. </p>
<p> Dish has officially completed the acquisition of the merged T-Mobile's mandated divestiture of its various prepaid carriers — now all under the Boost Mobile umbrella — valued at $1.4 billion. With new ownership comes immediate changes such as a modified logo and new rate plans effective tomorrow. </p>
<p> One of the laces left untied in the closure of the Sprint and T-Mobile merger was the condition that the combined carrier would sell prepaid entity Boost Mobile to Dish Network. Now, after a blip of a possibility that the satellite company would back out of negotiations, the two have officially locked into the divestiture deal. </p>
<p> Virgin Mobile is one of the smallest network carriers in the United States. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Sprint, the MVNO has been on the decline for years, and now the brand is set to cease operation as early as next month. </p>
<p> After years of back-and-forth boardroom negotiations, handshakes with government officials, a failure along the way, and many doses of hard bargaining, Sprint and T-Mobile are on track to merge and form a wireless carrier with a total of 137 million subscribers. The Department of Justice recently greenlit the deal, all we're waiting for now is the FCC vote. Today, the countdown has begun as commission chairman Ajit Pai announced his support for the combination. </p>
<p> Amidst news of the Department of Justice's approval of its merger with Sprint, T-Mobile has announced a record second quarter with big gains in both subscribers and revenues. In its earnings call, the carrier tooted its horn about its rapid pace of capital expenditure related to 600MHz and millimeter wave spectrum and painted a couple of insights to its spectrum and MVNO sale to Dish. </p>
<p> Virgin Mobile has been a popular pre-paid wireless carrier in the United States for a while now, using Sprint's network as a backend. As with most carriers in the US, both iPhones and Android devices were available to customers. However, Virgin has now partnered with Apple and will only offer iPhones moving forward. </p>
<p> Every day we seem to be inundated with ads about who has the absolute cheapest data plan. Online, television, billboards, junk mail, even old-fashioned radio - it seems I can't go five minutes without each carrier telling me how much cheaper they are than everyone else, going so far as to hire old Verizon spokesmen and make dubious claims about reliability. </p>
<p> You know what? To hell with all of that. I've looked at every smartphone plan from every nationwide carrier in the country, big and small, to find the absolute cheapest plans. Let's pinch some freakin' pennies. </p>
<p> Among postpaid plans, shared data has become par for the course. Your family (or "family") gets a certain allocation of data that everyone is allowed to use. This way instead of everyone getting 2GB of 3G/4G LTE, with a few people hardly touching their allotment and others burning through theirs in a week, the heavy users can have at the otherwise unused data as well. </p>
<p> Now Virgin Mobile is bringing the same treatment to prepaid, no-contract plans. In a deal that's available exclusively at Walmart, the Sprint subsidiary is letting customers sign up for a "Data Done Right" plan for roughly $30 a line. </p>
<p> Perhaps you noticed that AT&T started selling the low-cost HTC Desire 610 late last month for just $0.99 on-contract and $200 without. That was apparently only the first step in HTC's attempted conquest on the mid-range device market in the US. The 610 is now on sale direct from HTC and the Desire 816 is launching on August 12th (tomorrow) on Virgin Mobile and direct from HTC. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S5 is a pricey phone, the cost of which the big four American carriers typically offset by pushing consumers towards two-year contracts. They generally also offer the choice to pay for the entire phone upfront, but people who want to own the phone outright and have the several hundred necessary to do so stand to benefit from shopping around for the lowest price, and lowest commitment, option available. Today both Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile have added their names to the list of providers willing to sell a Galaxy S5, doing so for $599.99 with no contract. </p>
<p> Boost Mobile's plans start as low as $40 a month with unlimited talk/text and 500MB of data. </p>

<p> Virgin Mobile is also reshuffling its phone plans. </p>
<p> Pay-as-you-go Sprint subsidiary Boost Mobile would like you to know that they've got LTE service. It's okay if you didn't - it's not as if they had any phones that could take advantage of the speedier standard. But that should be rectified in just a couple of weeks, when the HTC One SV And the ZTE Force (officially the "Boost Force by ZTE," because American carriers like to push around smaller OEMs) become available for purchase. You can pick both of them up on March 7th for $299.99 and $199.99, respectively and without contract. Meanwhile, over at the other prepaid Sprint MVNO, Virgin is repackaging the Samsung Galaxy Victory 4G LTE for $299.99. </p>
<p> Virgin Mobile USA, a no-contract budget mobile U.S. retailer with plans starting at $25/mo for unlimited text/web/data and 300 minutes, has only crossed paths with Android once, with the introduction of Samsung Intercept. However, another contender, LG Optimus V, an equivalent of Optimus S on Sprint, Optimus T on T-Mobile, etc. just popped up at RadioShack.com, before even hitting Virgin's own site, which is expected to happen on February 1st. There have been reports of the device being available in some brick and mortar Virgin Mobile USA stores, but it looks like this RadioShack appearance is the first time it became available online. </p>
<p> The Black Friday is long gone, but another, potentially even bigger event, called Cyber Monday, is now upon us. Cyber Monday is what happens when the Black Friday goes online, and Virgin Mobile USA does not disappoint. The carrier, which uses Sprint's network, is offering its only Android handset, the Samsung Intercept, for a whopping $75 off. The deal is valid for the duration of Cyber Monday, so hurry up if you want this 800MHz Android QWERTY slider for $175, with free shipping. The beauty of Virgin Mobile USA, of course, is its plans starting at $25 a month, with NO contract to sign. </p>

<p> virtual assistant </p>
<p> Despite Google Assistant now being available on most Android devices, many OEMs have been looking to build their own virtual helpers. Samsung has Bixby, LG has ThinQ, and now Huawei has... something. The company already has an assistant on its Chinese devices, but now it's working on a new one that will 'provide emotional interactions.' </p>
<p> You can already get Alexa in phones, speakers, and a few accessories. Amazon wants more, though. The handful of Alexa-powered accessories on the market were developed with standalone smart features, but that's tough to do. Now, Amazon is looking to strengthen Alexa's position by making it easier to get the virtual assistant integrated with accessories like headphones, smartwatches, and more. These devices will, however, require a phone connection. </p>
<p> Facebook is getting in on the digital assistant game currently occupied by the likes of Google Now, Apple's Siri, and Microsoft's Cortana. But the social network is taking a different approach with M, the name of its virtual pal. This little helper waits around inside Messenger to answer your questions, and in those instances when its algorithms can't come up with a solution, there are real people working behind the scenes who can. </p>
<p> That's right, Facebook says that M's artificial intelligence is trained and supervised by real people. This partially confirms the Moneypenny rumor circulating last month that the company was developing a digital assistant of its own. </p>

<p> We're starting to hear a few Galaxy S8 rumors well ahead of the usual Mobile World Congress-ish reveal for Samsung's flagship series (usually around late February or March). That may or may not have something to do with the phenomenal failure of the Galaxy Note 7, after which Samsung must be scrambling to shift potential customers' attention elsewhere. So we're treated with two somewhat credible pieces of Galaxy S8 info in a single week: one that Samsung will drop the headphone jack, and another that the company will finally release its deathgrip on physical home buttons. </p>
<p> Honeycomb, the first Android version designed specifically with tablets in mind, was released way back in February 2011. It was built exclusively for large screens and was never meant to reach phones, but it paved the way for Ice Cream Sandwich, arguably one of the most significant updates to ever hit Android. Taking several cues from Honeycomb, Android 4.0 brought about some of the biggest changes to the OS, not the least of which was the advent of virtual or on-screen navigation buttons. </p>
<p> The title may not rhyme anymore, but it's still home to the most in-depth look at the next version of Android on the internet. That's right, the world's most OCD changelog is here to point out every polished pixel of Android 4.1: Jelly Bean. </p>
<p> The usual GTKA caveats apply: This is beta code (the Jelly Bean preview from I/O, in fact) and subject to change. Plus I've got it running on a phone it isn't even meant to run on, so we won't be too hard on it. </p>

<p> "Virtual Desks," which is Google's name for the more generic term "virtual desktops" (or the greatest thing ever) have been spotted in Chrome OS 77 in the current Canary Channel. We previously anticipated their arrival to the platform when a Chromium Gerrit commit indicated it would be coming eventually, but now it's actually here and working as of the latest Canary builds. Our friend Kevin Tofel over at About Chromebooks spotted the feature when it hit, and put together a good video demonstrating it live on real hardware: </p>
<p> In what I will adamantly defend as the biggest news of the month, it looks like Google has started work on a feature it is calling "virtual desks" for Chrome OS. Based on a video published together with the Chromium Gerrit commit, the feature is effectively virtual desktops for Chromebooks, which we were previously told the company was working on. (YAY!) </p>
<p> In the lead-up to our Pixel Slate not-review, I had a chance to interview the senior product manager for Chrome OS at Google, Kan Liu. We talked about the larger tablet experience on Chrome OS and where the operating system was headed, when at one point I brought up the question of virtual desktops (also known as workspaces). Liu was aware of Chrome's shortcomings in that respect, and while I acknowledged that the expose feature allows users to keep multiple windows available to them with their preferred tabs open, it's not a direct replacement for virtual desktops, something other operating systems like Mac OS and Windows have long supported. </p>

<p> The coronavirus pandemic ruffled Chrome and Chrome OS releases quite a bit, so Google paused updates for a short time, even omitting version 82 altogether. But now the company is getting back on track and has announced the release of Chrome OS 83. It'll start rolling out to first people this week, and it brings a whole slew of neat improvements to the table. None of them are as big as the addition of gesture navigation we've seen in version 81, though. </p>
<p> Whenever Chrome is updated to a new version, a Chrome OS release naturally isn't far out. The operating system receives the same additions as the browser, such as click-to-call and improved native file handling, and gets some exclusives on top: Virtual desktops are rolling out with this release, and all compatible printers will automatically show up on your device without setup in the future. </p>
<p> Back in 2018, Google told us that it was planning on adding support for virtual desktops to Chrome OS, and following some teasing, we finally got them under the name "Virtual Desks." The only real issue with Google's implementation was with navigation: you had to enter the "Overview" mode then manually click around the list of desktops like some kind of laptop-wielding neanderthal. Thankfully, a recently spotted comment on the Chromium bug tracker (noticed by Chrome Unboxed) indicates we'll eventually get a "4-finger swipe and lift" gesture that should make using Virtual Desks much easier. </p>
<p> Following a bit of a hiccup when it came to the previous Chrome OS 75 release, Chrome OS 76 has been pushed to the Stable Channel and is rolling out to some devices. As well as picking up features from Chrome 76, the latest release includes Android-style notification media controls, support for virtual desktops, some accessibility improvements, and GPU acceleration for some Chromebooks in Crostini/Linux containers, among a whole pile of other changes — and you'll get to hear about most of them via the new "What's new with your Chromebook?" </p>

<p> Chromebooks were initially designed to be lightweight web-browsing laptops but gradually started gaining more features, especially when it came to offline computing. However, unlike macOS or Linux, Chrome OS doesn't have the ability to locally run Windows apps, which can sometimes be essential, especially when it comes to corporate apps. Back in June, Parallels and Google announced a partnership stating Chromebooks would soon be able to run Windows apps "seamlessly." The promise is now closer to reality, with the Parallels Desktop for Chromebook Enterprise set to be released this fall. </p>
<p> Chromebooks weren't originally designed to run traditional PC software, but Google is slowly attempting to fill that gap. Chrome OS already has an optional Linux container for running some desktop software (albeit with poor graphical performance), but now Windows applications will soon appear on the platform in some capacity </p>
<p> Intel's progress into the Android ecosystem hasn't exactly been earth-shattering. The number of high-end and mid-range smartphones equipped with an ATOM CPU still number in the single digits, making the x86 architecture a fairly low priority for app developers. In addition, Intel's emulator images have always lacked support for the Google APIs, leaving developers without the ability to test common staples like Google Maps or push messaging. Fortunately, that issue was recently rectified with KitKat as Google and Intel have finally shipped an x86 system image with Google API support. </p>
<p> Ok, so testing Android apps with Google-specific features on an ATOM emulator probably doesn't sound terribly exciting, but there's a major upshot: developers can finally use HAXM without making sacrifices! </p>
<p> Using a work phone and a personal phone at the same time sucks. That's the motivator behind the Bring Your Own Device ("BYOD") trend, wherein employees use their own smartphones for work-related tasks. Most people do this anyway, but it can become a real problem if you're working with sensitive data. That's where VMware comes in. This company specializes in virtualized PCs for remote access and security, and after years of development, it's expanding into mobile with Android. Too bad it's only available on Verizon at the moment - and only on two mid-range phones at that. </p>
<p> VMware's Horizon Mobile solution works like this: your company sets up a default mobile workspace, complete with apps, security measures, and even a wallpaper if they want. </p>
<p> A few days ago, I posted about a student project at a Russian University that aims to run two or more instances of Android at the same time on a single device. It's a technology called virtualization, and we already use it on web servers and developer machines everywhere. </p>
<p> At first glance, the idea sounds interesting, but seems to lack practical uses for the majority of people. Sure, some developers will save a few hours on testing, and industrious users might want to run the latest CyanogenMod nightly ROM alongside their daily driver, but this kind of stuff doesn't really appeal to your neighbors or parents. </p>
<p> Go ahead and file this one in the Super Cool Tech category. A Russian blog, Rozetked.ru, posted video of a Galaxy S2 running two copies of Android at the same time. The three-and-a-half minute video takes us through a demo switching between a pair of ROMs while playing music from both, proving that the hardware resources can be shared. After the audio segment, we are shown decently high frame rates on a 3D benchmarking app and Angry Birds. According to the team behind the project, running two concurrent instances of Android only takes about 10% off of battery life while the impact on system speed is negligible. </p>
<p> If you've ever dreamed of syncing your Android apps and games up with your PC and using them on a larger screen you'll be excited to hear that your dreams are becoming a very well-designed reality. Actually, if you've been following along with the development of BlueStacks then you know that this dream-to-reality transition has been in the works for several months now. </p>
<p> For those of you that don't know exactly what BlueStacks App Player is, it's exactly what the title implies - an app player that allows you to run Android applications on Windows (a Mac version is also in the works). </p>
<p> Have you been tempted by the recent onslaught of Honeycomb tablets entering the market, but forced yourself to hold back due to the lack of virtualization options available on the platform? No, neither have I (held back, that is), but these 'pro' applications always help when using a tablet, right? </p>
<p> VMWare users will be no doubt be delighted to hear about the arrival of VMWare View on the Android Market, which has been designed and developed from the ground up to give Honeycomb users the best possible experience when accessing their virtual Windows desktops on the go. </p>
<p> Currently available from the Market as a free tech preview, the application utilizes the PCoIP protocol so that you can control your computer effectively whether you're on a fast WiFi network or a slower 3G connection, as it adapts the quality of the connection depending on how much bandwidth you have available. </p>
<p> If you've been looking for a 7 inch tablet without the bells and whistles of the HTC Flyer or the newly announced ASUS Eee Pad MeMO 3D, then it looks like ViewSonic may have your number, as it has just announced its newest Honeycomb tablet: the 7-inch ViewPad 7x. </p>
<p> ViewSonic ViewPad 7x </p>
<p> The ViewPad 7x is pretty cut-and-dry as far as Android tablets are concerned - just in a smaller package. It's packing a 1GHz Tegra 2 processor under its hood, along with a 7 inch, 1024x600 display, HDMI out, microUSB, and support for HSPA+. </p>
<p> ViewSonic 10Pro </p>
<p> If the 7x isn't your thing, however, ViewSonic has also announced a second tablet - the 10 inch, Intel Oak Trail sporting 10Pro. </p>

<p> virtual keyboard </p>
<p> Probably the only Android TV box worth consistent attention is the Nvidia Shield TV, which does just about everything the right way. It comes with a handy physical remote, but still, some users have called for a mobile app. Nvidia is finally giving them what they want. </p>
<p> Over on Google+, "Chromium evangelist" François Beaufort announced that Chrome OS, starting with Canary builds, will default to a floating virtual keyboard. This means that typing onscreen will, theoretically, be easier going forward as Google's desktop OS continues to expand its scope. </p>
<p> If you have an Android phone made by Samsung, there's a good chance you use the company's own web browser. Unlike many bundled browsers, Samsung Internet is built using the Chromium open source project, so it's pretty close in functionality to Google's Chrome, but better integrated with Samsung's wider ecosystem of apps. The developers of Samsung's browser are pretty quick to add new features, and the latest of these is a feature to help when filling out a form. </p>
<p> 'Smart Go Next' is a relatively simple change, but one that could be very useful and save a lot of frustration. </p>
<p> A couple of years ago, I couldn't talk to anyone about smartphones for two minutes without them shouting in ecstatic delirium, "Have you seen the new iPhone 5?" Of course, they were talking about this concept video, which everyone in their right mind knew was a "concept" for no less obvious reason than the fact that it was titled as such and created by an animation studio. Except hundreds of people around me still believed it was the real deal. Before I digress any further into the naiveté of common mortals when it comes to technology, I'll remind you of the one feature in that video everyone thought was super cool and that has made it onto countless other concept videos for various companies and products: the projected keyboard. </p>
<p> Update: A Fleksy representative contacted us to say that the keyboard will be available as a free download to all Gear S owners, but will not be pre-installed. The title of this post has been changed to reflect this. </p>
<p> -- </p>
<p> The Gear S is an interesting device, not so much for its hardware as for its approach: Samsung decided to equip the smartwatch with a stand-alone wireless connection so it can work just fine on its own, thank you. Of course, that also means that for at least some of the time you'll need to operate it like a smartphone strapped to your wrist... </p>
<p> Come on, you can't be serious. This has to be a joke, right? No? Fleksy is actually making a tiny software keyboard for the Gear 2? Okay then. </p>
<p> Fleksy claims that its Messenger keyboard is the first one to be featured on the Gear 2, and we're not going to argue. Touching on the inevitable difficulty of typing on a screen 1.6 inches across, the press release says that "Fleksy’s sleek design and unparalleled prediction engine makes it virtually effortless." If you say so. At present the virtual keyboard is only for replying to text messages... not that there's much else you would want to type out like that. </p>

<p> Hot on the heels of its competitor CrossOver, Parallels has announced that its Windows virtualization service is now available on Chrome OS for Enterprise, allowing businesses to run a full Windows emulation right on their Chromebooks. This follows months and years of preparation work, with initial teasers landing in June and August. </p>
<p> Chromebooks were initially designed to be lightweight web-browsing laptops but gradually started gaining more features, especially when it came to offline computing. However, unlike macOS or Linux, Chrome OS doesn't have the ability to locally run Windows apps, which can sometimes be essential, especially when it comes to corporate apps. Back in June, Parallels and Google announced a partnership stating Chromebooks would soon be able to run Windows apps "seamlessly." The promise is now closer to reality, with the Parallels Desktop for Chromebook Enterprise set to be released this fall. </p>
<p> Even though Chrome OS is based on Linux (Gentoo Linux, to be exact), you can't run traditional desktop Linux applications. One solution to this problem is Crouton, a script that sets up a chroot of Ubuntu or Debian Linux on top of Chrome OS. While this does allow many people to use Chrome OS who otherwise couldn't, it's a hacky solution and requires enabling Developer Mode (which turns off most of Chrome OS' security features). </p>
<p> Jide's Remix OS has turned a lot of heads in the last couple of years, thanks to an interesting initial tablet offering and subsequent easy-to-install software for both PCs and a few Nexus tablets and even some retail hardware. The modified Android software, which uses a desktop-style window system for apps, is surprisingly robust and easy to use. Jide's latest move is to offer Remix as a virtual machine package, allowing Windows desktops, laptops, and tablets to run the Android ROM in a dedicated window alongside desktop applications. </p>
<p> Windows Phone, eat your heart out. Android is now capable of virtualizing a full and up-to-date Windows desktop operating system. Well, one phone is at least, and it's probably not one you would have guessed: the ASUS ZenFone 2. XDA-Developers forum member ycavan managed to get Windows 7 running on his phone using a variety of custom tools, some impressive technical skill, and quite a lot of patience. Check it out in the video below: </p>
<p> To be clear, this is Windows 7, virtualized, running on a local virtual machine client accessed via the aSPICE KVM client for control. Windows is not being emulated (it's been done with older versions). </p>
<p> If you're not an IT manager or an employee of a company with a sizeable tech infrastructure, feel free to skip this post. But if either of those descriptions fit you, you may be interested in Amazon's latest foray into B2B services. Amazon WorkSpaces is a remote, virtualized desktop - basically your own personal Windows machine that lives in the cloud - and it's got an Android client just one day after the service was launched. </p>
<p> From an end user perspective, WorkSpaces is very similar to all the other remote desktop apps out there, except that you're not logging into a physical machine. </p>
<p> A few days ago, I posted about a student project at a Russian University that aims to run two or more instances of Android at the same time on a single device. It's a technology called virtualization, and we already use it on web servers and developer machines everywhere. </p>
<p> At first glance, the idea sounds interesting, but seems to lack practical uses for the majority of people. Sure, some developers will save a few hours on testing, and industrious users might want to run the latest CyanogenMod nightly ROM alongside their daily driver, but this kind of stuff doesn't really appeal to your neighbors or parents. </p>

<p> This morning we told you about RIM's plan to bring Blackberry Enterprise Solution to Android and iOS, with a brief mention of Android apps running on the Playbook. No sooner than we posted the aforementioned article did we find out that RIM had demonstrated just that at Blackberry World Conference. Take a look at the video: </p>
<p> Each Android app will run in its own virtual machine, but will seamlessly integrate into the Blackberry ecosystem. The Playbook doesn't have access to the Android Market, either - all compatible Android Apps will be available through the Blackberry App World. This does mean a bit more headache for developers, though, as they will now have to submit their apps not only to Google for the Android Market, but also to RIM to be accepted into App World. </p>
<p> Some combinations are as natural as peanut butter and jelly - Avatar & 3D, Apple & dictatorship, and Conan O'Brien & late-night comedy, to name a few. But are Android apps and the BlackBerry PlayBook also such a sweet match? If you ask RIM, the answer is a firm, definitive "yes." </p>
<p> The BlackBerry maker just confirmed the age-old rumors - it's announced that the upcoming QNX-based PlayBook tablet will support Android apps. There are, however, certain limitations - while the process doesn't sound overly complicated, developers of existing Android apps will need to put some work in to porting their software over, namely "repackaging, code signing, and submitting" it to the BlackBerry App World. </p>

<p> My Tamagotchi Forever has been available as a soft-launch title in Canada for the past few months, but it looks as though Bandai Namco is ready for the rest of us to get a taste of its new free-to-play virtual pet simulation game thanks to it officially releasing today on the Play Store. You can expect plenty of traditional Tamagotchi gameplay such as feeding and washing your digital pet, though there are a few new mechanics added on top that extend the longevity while also stuffing in a few too many in-app purchases. </p>
<p> Love is fun everywhere. This is the audacious claim that Bandai is peddling with its new app "Tamagotchi L.i.f.e." And yes, that is what the acronym actually stands for. If you're of the opinion that love might only be fun in certain places, then I challenge you to download this virtual pet to your phone. This thorough recreation of the pocketable pals of the late 90s will teach you how to love again as you lovingly scoop its loving poop and let it win games, lest it gets lovingly mad at you. Love. </p>
<p> The app offers two options for interacting with your virtual pet. </p>

<p> virtual private network </p>
<p> Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs for short, are incredibly useful. They're even more useful when you're stuck at home, as you can access the internet from different parts of the world without leaving your couch. Want to watch a Netflix series that isn't available in your country or keep your ISP from snooping? You can do those and more with the right VPN. </p>
<p> We've heard a number of rumors about Google launching its own Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO), codenamed Nova. According to reports, the service will source wireless service from Sprint and T-Mobile, but it will rely on Wi-Fi networks to bear most of the weight of both data and voice services (though VoIP). While the details of this plan still aren't clear, another piece of the puzzle just emerged that indicates Google is going to offer its own virtual private network (VPN) service, and it may be targeted specifically at Nova subscribers. </p>
<p> This information resulted from a tip we received a few days ago, pointing us in the direction of a new application called Google Connectivity Services. </p>
<p> People regularly rely on Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to hide their activities from nosy governments, circumvent geographically restricted and region-locked services, and increase security on untrusted Wi-Fi networks. But the big problem with piping your communications through a secure digital tunnel is that it's an all-or-nothing deal – web browsing, IM chats, and email are all going over the wire to the same place. That can become a really serious issue for people that use an employer's VPN for work. With Android 5.0 Lollipop, VPN clients can finally offer granular control over which apps communicate over a secured network, and which apps connect to the Internet directly. </p>

<p> virtual reality </p>
<p> You probably barely remember what Daydream is, or rather was, and no-one will blame you for that. Google launched its VR platform back in 2016 and even introduced its own View headset to the market, which it also updated about a year later. Apps became gradually available for the platform until many of them stopped being updated, or worse, entirely dropped support for Daydream. It was clear Google pretty much abandoned it, but it's now made it official with an announcement. </p>
<p> Virtual reality was beginning to feel like a big deal back in 2014, and Oculus was one of the prime players. After a successful Kickstarter campaign for the Rift VR, Facebook saw a chance to snatch the company up and purchased it for $2 billion in cash and stocks. Now after six years, Oculus is announcing that Facebook accounts will be mandatory for new users starting in October, and existing users may lose functionality if they don't merge their accounts by 2023. </p>
<p> Virtual reality company Oculus used to have a tight partnership with Samsung, to the point where both company's devices shared the same software ecosystem. The Oculus Go was released in 2018 as a self-contained VR headset, with a Snapdragon 821 processor and full compatibility with games built for Samsung's Gear VR. Sadly, it's now time to say goodbye to the headset. </p>
<p> Virtual Reality may not be the hot topic it once was, a few years ago, but it has settled into a nice niche for gaming first and foremost, and media consumption to a more minor degree. If you're intrigued by VR and have been pining for one of those powerful headsets, you can spare your wallet and start small today with the Oculus Go, which is down to $150. </p>
<p> It has been three weeks since the last Chrome release, and right on schedule, Chrome 79 is now rolling out across desktop and mobile platforms. This isn't the largest update we've seen recently, but there are a few changes worth highlighting. Let's jump right in! </p>
<p> Long before Google introduced Daydream and subsequently left it dead in the water, the company created the Cardboard platform. You can use the carton headsets as an ultra-low-budget entry to VR to this day, and they're compatible with almost any regularly shaped phone on the market. Google has now open-sourced the underlying VR SDK which will allow interested developers to create their own VR experiences on Cardboard viewers and improve and enhance the project as they see fit. </p>
<p> Chrome 78 has rolled out to all platforms, which means it's time for Chrome 79 to hit the Beta Channel. This update is definitely smaller in scope than the last few releases, but there are still a few interesting additions — especially if you're interested in VR/AR. </p>
<p> The VR hype train has slowed down considerably over the last couple of years, but that doesn't stop companies invested in the technology from iterating on their products. The same is true for Facebook, which announced a number of significant improvements to its VR division during its annual Oculus event on Wednesday, making advanced virtual reality experiences more accessible at lower prices. Among a plethora of changes to the platform, you can now let the Oculus Quest track your hands without additional hardware and connect it to a computer via USB, allowing you to get some of the full Rift VR experience. </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Note10 was officially announced last week, and while it's jam-packed with almost everything most people could want in a smartphone, it also dropped a few features: the headphone jack is completely gone, and the microSD card slot isn't present on the smaller model. It has also become evident over the past few days that the Note10 doesn't support any mobile VR platform, marking an end to both Gear VR and Google Daydream. </p>
<p> Slowly but surely, Google is piecing together details about its upcoming Stadia game streaming service. The company revealed most of the important information during E3 2019, but more information has arrived, courtesy of a Google Support page. </p>

<p> HTC Vive's venture into standalone VR headsets, the Vive Focus, was unveiled late last year, but the launch was unfortunately confined to the Chinese market. Unlike existing VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift or the standard HTC Vive, the Focus doesn't require being tethered to a powerful computer to work, making it a truly standalone experience. On the other hand, existing standalone virtual reality goggles like the Gear VR, Daydream View, or upcoming Oculus Go don't have spatial tracking, meaning that users aren't able to move around in 3D space. </p>
<p> When I published my review of the LG G5, my personal take on the device itself was positive and divergent from David's more criticizing review. However, there is one aspect both David and I agree on almost to the letter: the Friends. They are, in my opinion, fun to try, but you can tell they were rushed, with a poorly executed mechanism, and some highly doubtful usefulness factor. Well, all but the 360 Cam. That one is pure awesome bundled in magic and wrapped in 360 degrees of cool. </p>
<p> Here's how some of the modules work. The G5's bottom chin can be removed with a small button/latch on the side of the device. </p>

<p> virtual vacation </p>
<p> With all of us stuck at home because of the Coronavirus pandemic, a supermarket run is starting to feel like the biggest excursion and adventure we can go on for the foreseeable future. Travel is out of the question, local trips are restricted in many countries, and even the simple idea of stepping out of your house is as daunting as an alcohol and paranoia party. I've been yearning for a vacation for a while — I even had a trip planned for May before all of this went down — but since that's been canceled now, I've found myself thumbing through old pics and 360 photos I've taken during my trips, reminiscing about better times and nicer places, then it occurred to me that I could do something similar but also discover new countries and cities I've never visited, all through the magic of Google Maps, Earth, and Street View. </p>

<p> If you tried to sync your Garmin fitness band or smartwatch to the company's servers over the last few days, you may have noticed that something's awry. After initial reports pointed to a ransomware attack (via ZDNet), Garmin has now publicly confirmed that it's been hit by a cyber attack and that it's working to bring its servers back online over the next few days. </p>
<p> Researchers at Kaspersky Lab have identified a family of modular Android malware dubbed "Loapi," which is capable of mining the Monero cryptocurrency, inundating users with advertisements, automatically subscribing the user to paid services, and participating in DDoS attacks, among other functions. The cryptocurrency mining module maintains a load sufficiently high enough to cause physical damage to a test device after two days—the above photo shows a device which overheated to the point the battery bulged. </p>
<p> Computer security is important, even if the computer in question fits in your hand. There should be no doubt about that fact. However, you should be just as wary of security software as any other app. Case in point: there's a slick new app in the Play Store called Virus Shield. It's got a cool look and it's easy to operate. Just press a single button and your virus shield is activated. </p>
<p> You hear a lot of reports about malware and other undesirable third-party apps these days, especially from security researchers (and people who want to sell you something to make you feel safe). It's undeniable that malicious apps are a problem on an open system, but new data from Google indicates that the amount of actual harm being done might be negligible. QZ.com reports on a presentation from Google's Android Security Chief Adrian Ludwig at the Virus Conference in Berlin. He estimates that .001% of Android apps are able to get past Google's defenses. </p>
<p> A new piece of Android malware has been discovered by security researchers at Kaspersky Labs. That by itself wouldn't be big news, but this Trojan does things no other malicious app has done. It exploits multiple vulnerabilities, blocks uninstall attempts, attempts to gain root access, and can execute a host of remote commands. Backdoor.AndroidOS.Obad.a, as it has been dubbed, is the most sophisticated piece of Android malware ever seen. </p>
<p> There are two previously unknown Android vulnerabilities exploited by Obad. The malware installer contains a modified AndroidManifest.xml file, which is a part of every Android apps. The first big vulnerability is in the processing of this file by the system – it shouldn't be processed at all, but the app installs just fine. </p>
<p> We talked a little bit about Bitdefender's new antivirus offering earlier today in our giveaway post, but now we want to dive a little deeper into the app and explain what makes it good, how it differs from Bitdefender's paid mobile security service, and how it compares to similar antivirus offerings. </p>
<p> The first question you may have is "since Bitdefender's Mobile Security app was already free(mium), why release this?" That answer is actually pretty simple: as of today, the model for Mobile Security has changed to a trial period-only. Basically, you can try the full suite for two weeks, and after that are presented with the option to buy. </p>
<p> We've got an LG Nexus system dump and endless desire to spoil every Googley surprise we can. Today's edition of the Android 4.2 Teardown could be alternatively subtitled "The Super-Serious Security Edition," because we're talking about the sort of stuff that should make your sysadmin jump for joy. </p>
<p> Please keep in mind this is just as forward-facing and time-ambiguous as all my other teardowns. This is a list of new stuff in the 4.2 dump, not a list of "confirmed for 4.2" features. Anything could be cut or not fully implemented by the time 4.2 rolls around; similarly to how bits of Android are currently multi-user aware, yet multi-user functionality isn't accessible. </p>
<p> A new app update means a new APK Teardown here at AP. Today's victim is the Google Play Store, which was just freshly updated to 3.9.16. We've got all sorts of stuff to talk about. </p>
<p> A Built-In Malware Scanner </p>
<p> Yes, it's hard to believe, but Google is working on a malware scanner for the Play Store. The string file doesn't lie: </p>
<p> <string name="package_malware_title">App Check</string> <string name="package_malware_consent_text">"Allow Google to check all apps installed to this device for harmful behavior? To learn more, go to Settings > Security."</string> <string name="package_malware_banner_warning">Installing this app may harm your device</string> <string name="package_malware_banner_blocked">Installation has been blocked</string> <string name="package_malware_recommendation_warning">Google recommends that you do not install this app.</string> </p>
<p> Even if you haven't played it before, there's a decent chance you've seen Plague Inc. around the internet. Usually, it involves seeing a screenshot that informs you your mom has killed thousands of people. If you've ever wondered how you—yes, you!—can also create silly-named diseases that annihilate Earth's population with your Android phone, the answer has arrived! Go here, download the game, then spend 15 minutes staring at the screen trying to come up with something clever. Fair warning: "BieberFever" has already been done to death. </p>
<p> Of course, there is actually a game part to this game. The action is rather slow-going at first, but that's the point. </p>
<p> We at Android Police take our mobile security pretty seriously. It's in the job description. Entering the realm of mobile security today is yet another contender on the good side of the battle: VirusTotal has released its client for Android. Prior to this, VirusTotal was a simple website where you can upload suspicious files to be scanned by a multitude of antivirus engines. Having provided this desktop OS-oriented service for several years now, VirusTotal has brought its experience and expertise to mobile. </p>
<p> However, its mobile offering is slightly different than its desktop counterpart. As mobile devices are often data-limited, VirusTotal for Android instead checks an identifying hash of each application installed on your mobile device against the website's database. </p>

<p> Samsung Pay is rolling out in Germany, but with one major twist: Rather than relying on bank-by-bank support, which can take ages, the company is simply partnering directly with Visa and a fintech company named Solarisbank AG to roll it out for everyone at once. In short, that means basically anyone in Germany can set up Samsung Pay without their bank having to support it first. </p>
<p> Back in 2017, when Google Pay was still called Android Pay, it integrated with PayPal competitor Visa Checkout. This allowed you to use data from Google's payment service anywhere Visa Checkout was supported. Last week, Visa announced that it's shutting down the service in 2020 and Google is removing support for it. </p>
<p> Google is always keen to encourage more people to use its contactless payment service, which often means enticing promotions for us to make the most of. The latest such opportunity in the UK offers up to £50 in Google Play credit or the chance to win a Google Home Mini. </p>
<p> Google Pay has finally landed in Germany with support for four local banks. Users can download the app from the Play Store and start adding supported credit and debit cards today. </p>
<p> This time last year, Google confirmed that it was working to add support for Visa Checkout and Masterpass to Android Pay. The aim was to have the services integrated in early 2017, but we've not heard much about it since. There was evidence of Visa Checkout on Google's payment platform in a demo at I/O in May, but it remained to be seen when it would go live for users. </p>
<p> While the Android website shows that PayPal is already supported, it still has a 'Coming Soon' note by Visa Checkout, although we believe that was added recently and as a precursor to today's news. </p>
<p> Out of the different mobile payment solutions, Samsung Pay is probably my favorite — granted, my experience with Apple Pay has been limited thus far. Not only is there no bootloader restriction, but the support for old-fashioned magnetic terminals is a huge plus. But what about online shopping? Sammy has its customer base covered with the newly announced partnership with Visa, which will allow Samsung Pay users to shop at any virtual merchant who accepts Visa Checkout. </p>
<p> Dear Starbucks: thank you for existing. Not for your overpriced smoothie-coffee or your approachable yuppie atmosphere. No, thank you for being a Wi-Fi-soaked escape from my rural family's home during the holidays - T-Mobile service is still crappy out there. And while I'm extending some holiday thanks, I might as well give a shout-out to Visa, which is giving Starbucks customers $10 of free credit via the Starbucks app. That's approximately 2.5 Frappuccinos. </p>
<p> Android Pay is most commonly used to pay for things in real life via NFC technology, but from the start Google aimed to make it compatible with online payment systems. That hasn't really caught on, but a new partnership with Visa and MasterCard could help. Not to be left behind, Samsung Pay is also working with MasterCard. </p>
<p> Android Pay has slowly been growing to more and more regions, and now has finally reached the city of Hong Kong. This makes Hong Kong and Singapore the only regions in Asia supported by Android Pay. </p>
<p> Pay will be accepted at over 5,000 locations including 7-Eleven, Circle K, Fortress, McDonald's, and more. This works exactly like Android Pay in other regions; just install the app and you're good to go. </p>
<p> MasterCard and Visa cards are supported, as well as cards from BEA, DBS, Dah Sing Bank, Hang Seng Bank, HSBC, and Standard Chartered Bank. Online and in-app transactions with Android Pay also work. Google is also encouraging additional merchants to support Android Pay, so Hongkongers might have more locations accepting Android Pay in the near future. </p>
<p> Last year around this time, Google announced that unsupported cards already in Google Wallet accounts would be able to be used with Android Pay, but only for a limited time. Problem was, we didn't exactly know how long Google's "limited time" would be. Thanks to a ton of emails that were sent out to Android Pay users with unsupported cards today, we now have an actual date: October 14th, 2016. </p>

<p> Back in 2017, when Google Pay was still called Android Pay, it integrated with PayPal competitor Visa Checkout. This allowed you to use data from Google's payment service anywhere Visa Checkout was supported. Last week, Visa announced that it's shutting down the service in 2020 and Google is removing support for it. </p>
<p> This time last year, Google confirmed that it was working to add support for Visa Checkout and Masterpass to Android Pay. The aim was to have the services integrated in early 2017, but we've not heard much about it since. There was evidence of Visa Checkout on Google's payment platform in a demo at I/O in May, but it remained to be seen when it would go live for users. </p>
<p> While the Android website shows that PayPal is already supported, it still has a 'Coming Soon' note by Visa Checkout, although we believe that was added recently and as a precursor to today's news. </p>
<p> Out of the different mobile payment solutions, Samsung Pay is probably my favorite — granted, my experience with Apple Pay has been limited thus far.

Sammy has its customer base covered with the newly announced partnership with Visa, which will allow Samsung Pay users to shop at any virtual merchant who accepts Visa Checkout. </p>
<p> As many of you will recall, around Black Friday/Christmas last year, Best Buy ran a really sweet deal for Visa Checkout users. On any purchase of $100 or more, you would get $25 off. That is now back and with the same conditions. </p>
<p> Dear Starbucks: thank you for existing. Not for your overpriced smoothie-coffee or your approachable yuppie atmosphere. No, thank you for being a Wi-Fi-soaked escape from my rural family's home during the holidays - T-Mobile service is still crappy out there.

<p> The Asus ZenWatch never had a moment where it was wildly hailed as the most luxurious Android Wear watch, but it was still a relatively stylish device. Was it worth $200? That depends on who's answering. But for those who said no, here's a way to make the smartwatch more compelling—but you're going to have to jump through some hoops. </p>
<p> First, head to Newegg. There you will see the ZenWatch reduced down to $150 (the same price offered at Amazon). Add it to your cart and enter the coupon code VCO2015BTS. It will save you $10, but only if you complete your purchase using Visa Checkout. </p>

<p> Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, the team plans on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. </p>
<p> It never fails. You're walking along, reading your emails, not looking where you're going, and then boom! You trip over the cat and land nose-first into his empty food bowl. Transparent Screen aims to prevent this type of misstep by letting you see through your camera while you're walking. Unfortunately, it can't fix your cat's passive aggressive behavior, but we're sure an app like that is in the works. </p>
<p> We've seen apps like this before, usually designed for texting and walking only. This app's approach, however, is to make your entire Android experience translucent. As you can see in the screenshots above, no matter where you are in the OS, you'll be able to see through your rear-facing camera. </p>

<p> The Samsung Galaxy S20 lineup is finally here, and it's the most expensive Galaxy S series yet. The entry-level Galaxy S20 starts at $1,000, while the S20+ will set you back $1,200. To top it all off, the S20 Ultra costs $1,400 — you might need to sell a kidney for that one. </p>
<p> Verizon-owned carrier Visible recently took the speed limit off of its unlimited data offering all while still charging $40 a month for talk, text, and mobile hotspot service as well. Now, the company is hopping on the Prime Day bandwagon to highlight savings on a couple of its phone. It's also ready to actually give you money if you're willing to try out its network for 2 months — seriously. But there are a couple catches to be aware of... </p>
<p> You've probably heard about Visible by now — it's a new virtual carrier, combining incredibly low prices ($40/month) with coverage backed by Verizon's nationwide 4G LTE network. It has quickly become the best bang for your buck in the wireless industry, and it even works with Google's latest smartphones, the Pixel 3 and 3a. </p>
<p> Google chose RCS as the next holy grail of messaging after it shut down Allo and abandoned Hangouts. However, since the Rich Communication Services depend on the mercy of carriers and their specific device support, rollout has been exorbitantly slow, which even lead Google to take the reins and push out RCS in France and the UK using the Messages app (with more markets to follow). In the US, though, that's not the case so far. </p>
<p> Verizon's virtual carrier Visible has always had a compelling offer—just $40 per month for unlimited data. However, it caps LTE speeds at 5Mbps, which limits how much of that "unlimited" data you can use. Starting today, Visible will let customers sign up for uncapped LTE service, and it won't cost anything extra. There's a catch, though. This offer is only available for a limited time. </p>
<p> The Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL have just been announced at Google I/O 2019 and will be on the most carriers in the United States than any other generation of Pixel phone. Google Fi, Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, Verizon, and Visible are pegged to sell the phones as early as today for about $400 and $480, respectively. We've got all you need to know about any deals and quirks you should watch for. </p>
<p> You may not have heard of Visible, they're a new carrier to the scene here in the 'states, but they've hit the ground running. Much like banks that only exist online, Visible saves you cash by having no retail presence; everything is managed via the company's app. Just $40 a month gets you unlimited access to Verizon's all-encompassing network. And although you might think you're familiar with the concept, Visible is not an MVNO. </p>
<p> ZTE had a pretty rough 2018 thanks to the US Commerce Department's decision to enforce a suspended export ban against the company. That cut ZTE off from its US-based suppliers, resulting in an almost total shutdown. ZTE agreed to additional corporate changes and paid a new fine to get back in business, but it hasn't launched any new phones on carriers in the US until now. It's first post-shutdown carrier phone isn't exactly a showstopper, but you can get a new ZTE device right now on the Visible. </p>
<p> If you're not familiar with it, Visible is a digital carrier that launched last year. There are no physical stores, no contracts, and no hidden fees — activation and account management is done through an easy-to-use mobile app. The carrier has finally added support for Android devices, and to celebrate, we've partnered with Visible to give away a Samsung Galaxy S9, with two months of Visible service included. </p>

<p> Vision </p>
<p> Huawei is a very interesting company. They're heavily subsidized by the Chinese government. There's been a lot of controversy surrounding their products in terms of intellectual property infringement and military ties. </p>
<p> And then they go and unveil this thing, the Huawei Vision - and, as the title says, it bears a striking resemblance (from the front, at least) to a certain other phone: </p>
<p> Take a look at the top tier of Android phones right now and you might notice something. They all kind of look the same. Black front fascia, large touchscreen, minimal waistline. Boring, right? Well that's just the way things are going. Alternatives to the slate way of living are becoming increasingly rare, which puts the HTC Desire Z with its hardware keyboard in an intriguing light. With its metallic accents and suave grey pallet, the Desire Z cuts a different path. </p>
<p> Who says the G2's processor is slow, eh? While its stock 800 MHz clockspeed didn't break any benchmark records, it's showing itself to be nicely capable of overclocking. Unlike the QSD8250 in the original Snapdragon, which gets rather unstable anywhere past the 1.13GHz (+15%) mark, the MSM7230 in the Scorpion of the G2 sails right on past +100% with apparent stability. The kernel was posted on XDA-Developers by member Flippy125, with the usual "NOT MY FAULT IF-" disclaimers, but also noting that the kernel runs stably for him. </p>
<p> You're probably aware of one of the slightly more irksome facets of the G2 that is stymying attempts at custom ROMs, namely the locked down /system partition, where the OS is kept. Heretofore it has been impossible to tinker with this internal memory in a permanent fashion. All alterations were reverted on the next boot, leading to solutions like Paul O'Brien's VISIONary soft-root. </p>
<p> Well, Mr. O'Brien isn't the kind of fellow you can restrain with NAND lockdowns, and with a flourish today he unveiled his latest hack. </p>
<p> This article deals with a couple of advanced topics. If you’re unfamiliar with some of the terms, hit up our primers here: </p>
<p> With the G2 already getting a non-persistent "soft-root" solution, it was only a matter of time before someone combined it into a nice, user-friendly package. Stepping up to the plate (or rather, the crease) is Paul O'Brien, the founder of UK smartphone website MoDaCo, well known for a myriad of clever hacks. </p>
<p> Superusers, you can haz them </p>
<p> Deriving its name from the HTC Vision device codename, VISIONary is a simple one-click temporary root app for the T-Mobile G2. </p>
<p> Seems like the HTC phones are really taking up the lions share of Android news lately, doesn't it? First the G2 was rooted, and shortly after we learned that HTC did its best to prevent perma-rooting. And just this morning, we heard word that the Desire HD and Z are both being delayed. Quite a mouthful, we know - but now that you're up to speed: an enterprising individual by the name of kholk over at XDA-Devs has come up with a root method for the HTC Desire Z. </p>
<p> Over at XDA-Developers, Hitorii just got his sweet new T-Mobile G2. Naturally, before even opening the box, he went and told everyone about it. Wouldn't you? I am super jealous, anyway. </p>
<p> He also made a neat new discovery that we had not heard of before: the trackpad has an LED surround, which glows white on new notifications. He wasn't able to get it to glow any other colour, even using apps that do have coloured notifications, so it looks like the LED is not the same as the RGB light of the Nexus One. </p>
<p> While the teaser site for the T-Mobile G2 has been up for quite some time now, HTC, the company actually manufacturing the device, have been quite reticent about its specifications and what’s driving that stock Froyo goodness. Of course, we’ve known of its MSM7230 and various other details for a couple of weeks, but it’s nice to see the official specs solidified on HTC’s website. There are no surprises contained within, but something about the confirmation of what was once nebulous rumour can’t help but bring a warming pulse to every Android’s circuitry. </p>
<p> It’s not uncommon to see the big chains try to get a piece of the smartphone launch action with price reductions by mail-in-rebate. However, the hassle that this process usually entails doesn’t make things all that enticing to customers. Thankfully pre-orders for the G2 aren’t yet open on T-Mobile’s website, so prospective buyers now have the pleasure in knowing they’ll be able to get in instant discount with RadioShack, bringing the price down to $149.99 on a two year contract. </p>

<p> Hot on the heels of this morning's full and permanent G2 and Desire Z root, XDA-Devs members (apparently headed by grankin01) have released a similarly full and permanent root for the T-Mobile myTouch 4G. In fact, the method is very nearly the same, in grankin's words: </p>
<p> unforgiven512 [who contributed to the G2 root] deserves most of the credit for this tutorial as all I did was rewrite this tutorial in my own words (while looking at his in another window), edit the kernel module, and paste links to it and the hboot file with this tutorial. </p>

<p> Welcome a fresh update of Google Maps to the world. Version 9.78 began rolling out to the beta channel last night, and with it come a few visual tweaks and a cool new feature for custom lists that shows the places you've visited. Turning to the teardown, it looks like Google will be giving contributors a little more visibility and control over their public profiles. Drivers in São Paulo, Brazil will also be getting a useful tool for navigating through or around the rodízio. </p>
<p> Google Maps has a new beta peeking out on devices. After a great deal of poking around, the list of changes for the interface is pretty sparse, but as always, there's a ton to discuss from the teardown. There's more from the home screen shortcuts, showtimes with ticket sales, detail fields for food photos, and way more. </p>

<p> Jaybird was one of the first companies to popularize the true wireless earbud form factor, but its Run and Run XT products weren't without their fair share of issues. These new Vista models will hope to right the wrongs of their predecessors, offering a smaller/lighter design, better battery life, and a USB Type-C port for charging. </p>
<p> If you're in the market for a mid-range AT&T handset that kind of looks like the LG G3 but not really, today may be your lucky day. Well, August 22nd may be your lucky day, because that's when AT&T is going to start offering the LG G Vista. Not familiar with the Vista? No worries, here's the rundown: </p>
<p> 8GB storage, microSD card slot </p>
<p> It's a pretty run-of-the-mill mid-ranger spec-wise, but it's packing several of LG's G3 features, like Mini View, Dual Window, KnockOn and KnockCode, and several others. </p>

<p> According to Yelp, "the stars have aligned" for its new release, bringing a much-anticipated feature and a few photo-related tweaks. The anticipated feature I mentioned is, as the title of this post suggests, the ability to publish reviews right from your phone using the "add review" button from any business page. </p>
<p> Previously, users could only draft reviews for publication later through Yelp's website. Now though, you can publish reviews on the go or in the heat of the moment, before ever leaving the establishment you're praising and/or criticizing! </p>
<p> Titanium Backup, one of the most powerful – and popular – backup utilities available for Android, got an update to version 6.0 today. Don't get too excited though – the version bump consists primarily of bug fixes and optimizations, along with a few updated translations. Oh, and a redesigned menu. Yes, Titanium Backup's design is finally getting some attention, but not quite in the way we'd hoped – take a look at the before and after screens below. </p>
<p> Twitter continues its march towards being taken seriously as a social network with today's update to its mobile app that brings some interesting new profile additions. For starters, header images. With Facebook and Google+ beginning the trend, it seems a social network can't have just a profile picture anymore. Everyone who's anyone has a profile picture, and a hero image. </p>
<p> Curiously, the header images can only be added via the mobile app itself. </p>
<p> Mapsaurus, released today by a developer team of the same name, is perhaps the new app to end all new apps. By pairing an interactive map of Google's Play Store with an intuitive UX, Mapsaurus takes app discovery to a new level – not just of ease, but also of convenience. </p>
<p> The app, which promises to help users "discover apps you never would have known to search for," can branch out an interactive web of apps and games based on apps you already have installed, curated subcategories, or general categories and function sets. </p>
<p> Google Translate, the frequently-overlooked wonder app of the 3rd millennium, got some new features today. Chief among them is an amazing new image-based translation mechanism. The app now supports use of your camera to take a picture of the text you would like to translate. Once that's done, just "brush" over the word or phrase you need to read and Translate will do what it says on the tin: render that text in your preferred language. </p>
<p> Word Lens, the sometimes jittery but generally impressive visual language translator, is getting in the Olympic spirit. For a limited time, the language packs—which are acquired via in-app purchases to unlock full translation support—are being offered for $2.99 per pack, which is $2 off the normal price of $4.99. Huzzah! </p>
<p> It comes at a particularly poignant time. As the Olympic games get underway and the world remembers there's more that the nations of earth do together than wage war and make gadgets, Word Lens can be helpful in breaking down the language barrier and acting as a catalyst for that type of international camaraderie. </p>
<p> If you are a developer, you will want to fire up SDK Manager right now and perform an update. Besides the Honeycomb SDK preview that we'll talk about separately, Google also unleashed the next version of Android Development Tools, or simply ADT, for Eclipse as well as SDK Tools r9. I've been using ADT versions 9.0.0 preview 1, 2, and 3 for a number of weeks now, and I can tell you that 9.0.0 is a huge step up to where a serious set of development tools needs to be. </p>

<p> visual editor </p>
<p> This post is a bit meta, as Android Police itself is a WordPress-powered site. But anyone who uses WordPress will appreciate the massive, much-needed feature introduced in the beta version of the Android app today: finally, a true visual editor. </p>
<p> You see, previous versions of the WordPress Android app have offered a semi-functional visual editor when publishing or editing content, but this editor was extremely basic. Certain formatting and content like bolding, italicizing, underlining, strikethrough, quote blocks, hyperlinks, and images could be previewed live in the editor - but only when publishing a new post. When editing an existing post, the shortcuts for these tools were still available on the toolbar at the bottom of the screen, but they inserted the naked HTML markup into the editor, because the editor was, to use the technical term, janky as hell. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/visually-impaired/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17557055" filename="visually-impaired">
<p> I can't imagine having to navigate today's world while visually impaired. From streets to people to items, and even trivial things like preparing a sandwich or knowing the proper toilet sign in a restaurant, it would all be infinitely more difficult without sight, and I have a lot of admiration for those who have to handle these situations every day. Smartphones can make some of this easier, especially with AI at the helm. If Google Lens can identify a dog's breed from a photo, there's nothing stopping it from using the same tech to help visually-impaired people, and that's where Lookout comes in. </p>
<p> Audio descriptions are an invaluable tool for the visually impaired as they allow them to enjoy many movies and series despite not being able to (properly) see the on-screen action. In a settlement agreement with advocacy groups, Hulu agreed to provide spoken interpretations of scenes and facial expressions where possible in the form of an additional audio track. After adding support for this to the web player, Apple TV, and iOS, the company is now also making these tracks available in the Android app. </p>
<p> To many of us, a simple command such as "Alexa, what am I holding?" might seem redundant, but it could be indispensable for blind or visually impaired users. To that end, Amazon has introduced a new object recognition feature for its Echo Show devices, something Google should take note of now it also has a camera-equipped smart display in the Nest Hub Max. </p>
<p> Smartphones are very powerful computers that we often take for granted and simply use to check Twitter or Reddit and play some games or watch videos of puppies. But for the visually-impaired, smartphones can be very helpful tools that support them throughout the day and bring them a bigger sense of independence. We've covered several apps in this vein before, like Be My Eyes and Lookout, and now there's a new kid on the Android block: Envision AI. </p>
<p> Google has been working on lots of awesome things that didn’t get a mention during its I/O keynote on Tuesday. One of those things is an app called Lookout that helps blind and visually impaired people discover the world around them. Here’s how it will work when it lands on Android later this year. </p>
<p> I often forget how easy things are for me because I can see the world around me and recognize objects and read words. But for those who are blind or partially visually impaired, simple tasks like knowing the expiry date on the milk carton can be very complicated. </p>
<p> That's where the Be My Eyes service comes into play. Already available on iOS, the app has landed on Android and connects sighted volunteers with visually impaired users who need help with something. It uses an audio-video call to share what the blind/visually impaired person is seeing and allow them to talk to the sighted person and ask them questions. </p>
<p> It was announced earlier in the year at MWC (Mobile World Congress) in Barcelona, and now Samsung's impressive Relúmĭno app has been officially launched. The C-Lab project is designed to help people with visual impairments enjoy the same activities as others, and it uses Samsung's Gear VR headset in conjunction with one of the company's newer Galaxy phones, such as the S7, S7 Edge, S8, or S8+. </p>
<p> Move over SwiftKey. A challenger has appeared and it's aiming to bring even better predictions than we've seen before. This one, named Fleksy, touts predictions that are so accurate, you can type without looking at the screen. In fact, the company says that even if you get every single letter wrong, it can still tell what it is you meant to type. This is pretty impressive. Of course that means the developers need to take it one step further... </p>
<p> In the video above the company shows a blind user walking down the street, typing away on his smartphone (begins around 1:28). </p>

<p> visual novel </p>
<p> Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair Anniversary Edition has officially landed on Android for $15.99, and it joins the first title in the quirky visual novel series, which came to Android back in May (2020). Of course, we've known since April (2020) that all three games in the original trilogy would be coming to the Play Store in celebration of its 10th anniversary. However, the release dates have been mostly unknown, which is why the arrival of Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair Anniversary Edition comes as a surprise. </p>
<p> Spike Chunsoft announced that it would be bringing its Danganronpa visual novel series to Android back in April as part of a 10-year anniversary event. Today, the developer has released the first of three games slated for a mobile release. So, of course, the dev has started with the first title in the series, and it's an Anniversary Edition, which means it brings with it improved gameplay systems and a new gallery feature, as well as optimized touchscreen controls. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a timing-based arcade game, a stealthy action game, a pixel-based visual novel, a wave-based arcade game, a truck driving simulator, and a real-time multiplayer puzzle game. Without further ado: </p>
<p> When it landed on iOS last month, Annapurna Interactive's Florence was a hit, almost immediately making the App Store's Editors' Choice list. The game is simple, a so-called "interactive storyboard" that follows our protagonist Florence as her first relationship breaks up the mundane tedium of her life. Now those of us on greener (#A4C639) pastures can enjoy the game as well, and it's just been released for Android on the Play Store. </p>
<p> Capcom's Ace Attorney series of visual novel court drama games have existed for years on Nintendo handheld systems. While many have already been re-released on Android, one of the few missing from our platform was Ace Attorney Investigations - Miles Edgeworth. This is no longer the case as Capcom has just released the title on the Play Store, and it's even on sale for a limited time. </p>
<p> The dating simulator genre has some strange entries - which is to be expected, since it has a lot of DNA from the anime-inspired visual novel. For example, earlier this year we covered Hatoful Boyfriend, in which a human high school girl is courted by various pigeons. But My Horse Prince probably takes the cake: it tells the story of a girl who loves a horse. And not in that generically feminine, "I want a pony for Christmas" kind of way - she really loves him. Also, he has a human teenager's face for some reason. </p>
<p> The long-running Ace Attorney series from Capcom manages a practically impossible feat: making players sympathize with defense attorneys. With a mix of classic adventure game elements and anime-style hyper-dramatic courtroom scenes, the games have become incredibly popular both in Japan and with a worldwide audience. Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, the fourth game in the series (and the first to break away from the iconic Phoenix Wright protagonist), is now live on the Play Store for $15.99. </p>

<p> visual snapshot </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/08/06 3:10am PDTon Aug 6, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/06 8:16am PDTon Oct 6, 2020. </p>
<p> It's been years since Google started migrating the good ol' Google Now functionality into Assistant. Over time, the feed of relevant contextual cards has had many official names ranging from Your Stuff to Upcoming to Snapshot, and even more unofficial names (inbox, updates, dashboard). One thing remained unchanged though, and that's the fact that you couldn't customize a thing about it. This has changed now. </p>
<p> Snapshot in the Google Assistant is picking up a handful of new cards, according to our friends at 9to5Google. Additions include a more widely expanded "audio pics" card with playlists from YouTube Music, news, and podcasts, a card for upcoming sports events, and a "do it again" card for Assistant commands you commonly perform, similar to the suggested actions notification which rolled out earlier this summer. </p>
<p> Google Assistant's visual snapshot feature is intended to be a daily feed that provides you with all the necessary info you need to go about your day. Along with the weather, reminders, and upcoming appointments, the visual snapshot now includes...recipe suggestions. I mean, who doesn't like a good pizza recipe to start their day? Unfortunately, you can't remove it. </p>
<p> Google has toyed with Assistant's interface on Android countless times so far, adding a keyboard input method, Google Lens, then the Explore section, and finally the Now-like interface of upcoming cards (aka "visual snapshot"). But two things have puzzled me about it: one is that Explore and Visual Snapshot were almost invisible to people and I always had to explain where the icons were and what the did, and two is that getting to your Assistant's settings was an even more obscure process, and it was almost easier to just do it from the Google Home app than Assistant. Well, it seems that Google is working on solving at least the first of these problems. </p>
<p> The one-swipe convenience of the old Google Now was one of the most magical parts of using Android back in the day, and its devolution into the Feed was a reason of sadness for many, including myself. Although most of its features were still hidden away in the Google app, checking your calendar, packages, or flight status was no longer just a swipe away. Thankfully, Google pretty much brought it back last month in something it calls "visual snapshot" via the Assistant. And now Google is testing a new, more convenient way of accessing it with a swipe up on the Assistant overlay. </p>

<p> Microsoft is in the midst of its annual Build conference. This is sort of like Google I/O or WWDC, but with fewer online viewers. Wednesday's keynote presentation was filled with announcements about Windows 10, the Microsoft Edge browser, an augmented reality headset, and quite a bit more. One product failed to earn stage time: the Visual Studio Emulator for Android, but developers may find renewed interest since the latest version is showing maturity as it expands through the addition of Device Profiles and a number of other recent enhancements. </p>
<p> When it comes to software development, there are two very distinct camps on the subject of tools: those who prefer to keep it simple with just a text editor and a compiler, and then those who go straight for a fully-featured IDE with all the bells and whistles. For more than a decade, the undisputed champion of IDEs is Microsoft with its assorted versions of Visual Studio. Having come from years of work on Visual Studio, nothing pained me more than the first (several) times I started up Eclipse. </p>
<p> The majority of Android developers use Java to create their apps. While Java isn't the hardest programming language to learn, it's always best to get as many people developing as possible.... not that Android is hurting in that respect. Even so, a new way to create apps using Microsoft's familiar C# language is now available, by way of TallApplications BV's Dot42 - a tool that aims to accomplish this task without requiring something like mono. </p>

<p> Right on schedule, Sony's PlayStation Mobile is going live today, bringing PlayStation titles to certified devices and – of course – PS Vita. </p>
<p> While, at the moment, Sony's list of certified devices is limited primarily to Sony's own Android phones and tablets, more devices – including some from Fujitsu and Sharp – are expected to gain certification in the near future. HTC's One line is already on the list, with "details to be announced later on." </p>
<p> According to Pocket-lint, Sony is planning to bestow PlayStation Certification onto upcoming HTC Android smartphones by the middle of the year. What does said certification entail? </p>
<p> Basically, the PlayStation Suite project (of which PlayStation Certified hardware is a part) currently consists of a dozen or so ported PSX titles from Sony's back catalog - like Crash Bandicoot, or Syphon Filter. They work on PS Certified Android phones as well as the PlayStation Vita. </p>
<p> We certainly aren't a console video gaming blog, but when reviews of the US version of Sony's PlayStation Vita started cropping up this morning, I couldn't help but take notice of the new mobile console system's software. Particularly, how... smartphoney it looks. </p>
<p> Everything in Sony's Vita OS has been appified - Google Maps is there, while Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, and Skype apps are forthcoming. Sony has its own suite of apps as well, including a full-blown browser which, although it appears to be pretty terrible, is apparently the best on any mobile gaming device to date. </p>

<p> vivaldi android </p>
<p> Vivaldi went stable on Android this year, but the developers behind the Chromium-based browser aren't resting on their laurels. Following the introduction of a forced dark mode for all websites in June, the team is now turning its attention to making the bottom bar more consistent. It's also going more private by giving users enhanced control over tracker and ad blocking via access to additional blocklists. </p>
<p> Vivaldi is among the most customizable Chromium-based browsers out there (following Opera's example) and made the jump to Android last year in the form of a beta. After extensive testing, the makers of the browser have announced that they're launching the stable release of Vivaldi today, complete with a slew of new features first seen in the latest snapshot builds: a desktop-like tab strip at the top, built-in tracker and ad blocking, and more. </p>
<p> Vivaldi has a reputation for being an extremely customizable Chromium-based browser, all while working very fast. It was created by the same developers that brought us Opera, and shares many of those same genes. After staying exclusively on desktops for the past three years, Vivaldi is finally available as a beta on Android starting today. </p>

<p> HTC was the first Android device maker, and it remained one of the market leaders for years. Its recent performance hasn't been stellar, though. After a long line of lackluster quarters, HTC president Darren Chen promises improvements in 2019. Apparently, HTC is aiming for a sales "reboot" by focusing on high-end and mid-range phones. </p>
<p> HTC Vive's venture into standalone VR headsets, the Vive Focus, was unveiled late last year, but the launch was unfortunately confined to the Chinese market. Unlike existing VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift or the standard HTC Vive, the Focus doesn't require being tethered to a powerful computer to work, making it a truly standalone experience. On the other hand, existing standalone virtual reality goggles like the Gear VR, Daydream View, or upcoming Oculus Go don't have spatial tracking, meaning that users aren't able to move around in 3D space. </p>
<p> Many companies are still trying to make VR happen, though it feels like those couple of years when 3D TVs were being pushed and then completely disappeared. If you ask me, there's merit to the immersive experience of VR in certain situations, but the wider and easier adoption will be for AR when it's commoditized. But I digress. We've been keeping an eye on HTC's VIVE and Oculus for a while, even though they're not technically related to Android, but for the sake of information here are the two companies' CES 2018 news. </p>
<p> Google tried to create some buzz for its Daydream VR platform at its I/O developer conference back in May, even though public appetite for the tech seems to be waning. Standalone headsets were announced as the next evolution of the Daydream experience, but since then it's all gone rather quiet. We now know that HTC has canceled its plans to release a standalone Daydream headset, and is instead concentrating its efforts on China with a different standalone headset and development platform. </p>
<p> At Google I/O back in May, we saw the announcement of standalone Daydream virtual reality headsets from companies such as HTC and Lenovo. While they have yet to materialize, HTC has just announced that it's releasing the VIVE Standalone headset, and it will be exclusive to China. </p>
<p> VR has slowed in both improvements and public excitement recently. But that hasn't stopped Google from bettering its Daydream platform, its take on so-called "smartphone VR." Like Samsung's version, Daydream requires a phone to operate. As cool as this was, it led to some issues, notably battery life and heat. During this year's I/O keynote, Google announced the Standalone VR headsets that were rumored yesterday. As the name suggests, these devices won't require a phone to operate. </p>
<p> The HTC Vive has been making waves in the PC and gaming worlds, quickly emerging as a serious competitor to the more well-known Oculus Rift VR headset. The Vive has been in development for over a year with input from developers and other users, not to mention HTC's corporate partner Valve. The headset is nearing completion, and the company has announced that the final consumer model will ship in early April for the disappointing price of $799. For that price you get two motion-sensing controllers, two room scale sensors, and VR games Job Simulator: The 2050 Archives and Fantastic Contraption. Pre-orders begin next week on February 29th. </p>

<p> vivendi </p>
<p> Earlier this year we reported that Vivendi, a media mega-corporation headquartered in Paris, was attempting to take control of prolific mobile developer and publisher Gameloft. It appears that they've succeeded: today the company announced that it has purchased a 61.71% share of Gameloft's public stock, giving it more than half of the voting rights for the corporation. The company offered 8 euro per share to existing shareholders in February in a conventional hostile takeover attempt. </p>
<p> Gameloft has been one of the most consistent (if not one of the most respected) game developers since the beginning of the mobile gaming boom, though the company began on consoles. Vivendi, an enormous French media empire with interests in music, movies, video games, and pretty much every other entertainment industry, is attempting a hostile stock takeover of Gameloft, according to Bloomberg. The larger company has already purchased over 30% of Gameloft's stock, and is now offering 6 euros a share for the remaining amount. </p>
<p> Gameloft began humbly, founded in Paris by former executives of Ubisoft. Gameloft was one of the only companies that made high-end games for the old iOS and Windows Mobile platforms. </p>

<p> Over the past year or so, HTC devices have become notoriously more difficult to root/mod/S-Off than the devices of yesteryear. When one series of devices gets cracked, the next generation released by HTC has historically been drastically more difficult to crack. </p>
<p> This has been the case for some of the more recent HTC devices; namely the Amaze, Rezound, Sensation/XE, Vivid/Raider/Velocity, And MyTouch 4G Slide. Up until now, a few of those devices have never even received S-Off status. </p>
<p> Those with deeper knowledge of phone commands figured out how to get the Vivid to ask the update servers for this OTA (*#*#682#*#* - 682 stands for OTA, get it?) and successfully updated, but most Vivid owners to this day probably have no idea this method even exists. </p>
<p> The HTC Vivid, one of AT&T's mid-range (if you can call it that) phones is getting an unofficial bump to ICS courtesy of, who else? XDA. User Pirateghost has offered up a flashable Android 4.0.3 ROM. Stock, rooted and ready to go. It even comes with all that AT&T carrier bloat intact. You're getting the 100% pure, unadulterated stock experience with this one, just rooted. </p>
<p> As you can see, while it reads like ICS, it hardly looks like it at all. </p>
<p> It's not unheard of for tuners to throw a small PC into a car (commonly called a "carputer" in the industry). It's a lot less common for Android to appear in cars, though it does happen - GM has considered using it to power OnStar and has a Volt app, while the Roewe 350 rocks Android in a pretty hardcore way. We've yet to hear of aftermarket tuners taking advantage of Android - until now, that is. </p>

<p> vivo 5 </p>
<p> We've been working with Blu for quite a while now, and the company has been putting out some of its best phones to date over the last few months. With the release of the Life One X (2016) and Vivo 5, Blu has once again set the bar for what a "budget" phone can — and should — be. For $150 and $200 respectively, these are two of the absolute best phones that are available on the market today in this price range. </p>
<p> This contest is now over. </p>
<p> The final results are listed below. If you've won, you will be contacted in the near future. </p>
<p> Back at CES, Blu announced two phones: the Vivo XL and Vivo 5. While we've already taken a look at the former, the latter is the one we've really been waiting for. I've had it in-hand for about a week now, and there's honestly a lot to talk about with this handset. From the specs to the design, this definitely offers more than a $200 handset should, though there are definitely some quirks with the software. </p>
<p> But I'm getting ahead of myself now. Let's start at the beginning. And when we get to the end — stop. </p>
<p> Specs </p>
<p> Display </p>
<p> 5.5-inch 1280x720 Super AMOLED with Gorilla Glass 3 </p>
<p> Processor </p>
<p> 1.3GHz octa-core Mediatek 6753 64-bit with Mali T720 GPU </p>
<p> I feel like the new Life One X was somewhat of a turning point for Blu—they've always offered good phones for the price, but the LOX is a truly great phone for the money. It launched at just $99 for the first three days, which was an absolute steal; even now at $149, it's still a great deal for a phone that performs much, much better than its price suggests. </p>
<p> Today, at the Consumer Electronics Show, Blu pretty much confirmed my thoughts (that they're going to start offering even more bang for the buck moving forward) with the announcement of the Vivo 5 and Vivo XL. </p>

<p> Look, if you want a phone that won't break the bank, there are a lot of options worse than the Blu Vivo Air LTE. It's an upgrade over the original Vivo Air in many ways—the addition of LTE, more RAM, and on-screen buttons easily make the shortlist. I was kind of disappointed in the Snapdragon 410's performance overall when I reviewed it, but it's not atrocious by any standard. </p>
<p> For a very limited time—about five and a half hours at the time of publication, in fact—you can score the Vivo Air LTE for just $150. That's $50 off the normal price of $199, so it's a pretty solid deal. </p>
<p> Earlier this year, Blu released what would end up being my favorite phone from the manufacturer today: the Vivo Air. It was super sleek and thin, had a beautiful display, and was a generally great phone for just $199. Today, Blu announced the Air's successor, the Vivo Air LTE. </p>
<p> This phone basically corrects the weaknesses found in the original Air by bumping the RAM up to 2GB and adding LTE. This, of course, means the processor has also changed, and Blu has chosen to go with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 this time around. Otherwise, most of the other specs are the same: </p>

<p> Vivo has built a habit of announcing concepts with the most outlandish hardware that it wants to add to its regular lineup in the future. Its 2018 phone was one of the first in the industry to have a pop-up front lens and virtually no screen bezels while the 2019 release fully did away with regular ports and a selfie camera to eliminate points of failure and maximize the screen size even further. The Vivo APEX 2020 continues this trend, but it has received a front camera again in the form of an in-display solution and has stepped up the wireless charging game to 60W. </p>
<p> A phone with no charging port, no speaker grilles, and made completely of glass probably sounds a bit like satire from The Onion, but I can assure that’s exactly what Chinese smartphone maker Vivo showed us this week with its new - and fully functional - Apex 2019 concept phone. </p>
<p> The Apex is covered entirely in glass: the back, sides, and front are all smoothly polished, giving the phone an oddly smooth and almost stone-like quality. Vivo had to come up with an entirely new way to process glass in order to create the variable thickness and curvature required for the shape of a smartphone, and there’s no doubt that the result is impressive - it looks like no other smartphone I’ve ever seen. </p>

<p> Google's ARCore SDK is designed to make it easier to develop augmented reality apps. To guarantee a consistent experience across devices, the company certifies devices through a specific process that ensures the camera, motion sensors, and CPU perform as expected. For instance, a certified ARCore phone has access to Google's 3D Animal library in Search and Playground, and has been tested to work properly with these services. </p>
<p> Augmented Reality may not yet be the game-changer some of its proponents would hope it to be, but little by little it's been coming into its own. AR's been in the spotlight this month thanks to the launch of the Pixel 3 and Google's re-branding of its AR Stickers app as Playground, but that's just the half of it — we've also seen a number of new devices join the list of official AR Core-supporting hardware. </p>

<p> In late August, Google updated its list of devices that support ARCore with an addition of 28 new phones including Google's brand-new Pixel 4a, the LG Velvet 5G, Moto G8 Power Lite and G Pro, Vivo X50 and X50 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy A20, A20s, A30s, and Z Flip 5G, among a whole lot more.

<p> Of the available evidence, everything points to a Snapdragon 765G powering the anticipated Pixel 5, and that's caused a lot of spec-gazers to cast a doubtful eye on Google's upcoming phone. Prior to the Pixel 5, every Pixel phone used the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 series chipset, the most powerful SoCs available on the open market. With the 765G, though, we don't necessarily think Google's made a bad move—we've been using phones with the new high-end-of-the-mid-range Qualcomm chip—like the OnePlus Nord—and we're impressed. And we think there's really no reason the Pixel 5 really needs to full-fat 865 as a result. </p>

<p> Black Friday has come and gone, but we're not done with pre-holiday deals by a long shot. Cyber Monday is upon us, and the deals refuse to quit. A whole bunch of what we're seeing today is an extension of sales that have been running since last week, but there's plenty of new stuff, too. Here, for your convenience, we've rounded up all the best deals we've spotted. </p>
<p> Black Friday is still weeks away, but retailers are already raring to tell us about their deals. Costco's holiday offerings aren't as jam-packed as, say, Best Buy's; there are no Pixel or Chromebook deals here. Still, there's plenty to chew on, especially if you're thinking about a new Samsung phone. </p>
<p> Much like microSD cards, TVs have dropped drastically in price over the past years. A 65-inch 4K TV would have cost well over $10,000 back in 2012, but one can be had for less than a twentieth of that price today. Case in point: this 4K HDR Vizio 65-incher with built-in Chromecast support is just $449.99 at Walmart right now. </p>
<p> It's Monday! How's work? Well, make it better with some of these tasty discounts. Today we've got money off the first-generation Sonos One speaker, a big discount on a premium Vizio sound system, and AP-exclusive deals on some high quality backpacks for all your tech stuff, among other things. </p>
<p> After roughly six months of slow and steady rollout, the YouTube TV app is now available on all Vizio SmartCast TVs. The $40 per month cable alternative first arrived on a selection of newer, high performing Vizio models about half a year ago, with a YouTube engineer on Reddit noting that the company would add more models after monitoring and fine-tuning playback quality. That process seems to be complete now, as Google has just updated its YouTube TV app help page confirming the support. </p>
<p> LeEco has been nothing short of a dumpster fire for the past few months. Back in May, Jia Yueting stepped down as CEO after the company's botched attempt to enter the US market left LeEco strapped for cash. Not long after, Yueting's personal assets were frozen due to a missed loan payment. If you thought things couldn't get worse for LeEco, you were wrong. </p>
<p> According to The Verge, LeEco has just announced that it no longer intends to buy US television maker Vizio. </p>
<p> LeEco cited "regulatory headwinds" as the reason for calling off the merger. It could also have been a little bit, maybe, that it just seemed like a bad idea and honestly made no sense from a product strategy perspective. </p>
<p> Looks like Vizio is pulling itself out of some hot water. The popular television manufacturer (among other products) has been fined $2.2 million, payable to the FTC and the State of New Jersey, for some pretty serious privacy violations. Starting in 2014, Vizio has sold Internet-connected TVs that track what the customers watch and send that data back to its servers. </p>
<p> AMD is a pretty big name in the technology world. The semiconductor manufacturer, which rarely pursues legal action against others (at least publicly), has filed a patent infringement complaint with the U.S ITC against several other entities. It asserts that the offensive uses of those technologies negatively impacts AMD and its licensees. </p>
<p> A little while after LG's announcement that it would add Google Home compatibility to its Music Flow line, Vizio steps up and makes a similar announcement for its SmartCast series of connected speakers, displays, and the like. This will add the strength of voice control to Chromecast-ready devices like the Crave 360 and Pro speakers. </p>

<p> After roughly six months of slow and steady rollout, the YouTube TV app is now available on all Vizio SmartCast TVs. The $40 per month cable alternative first arrived on a selection of newer, high performing Vizio models about half a year ago, with a YouTube engineer on Reddit noting that the company would add more models after monitoring and fine-tuning playback quality. That process seems to be complete now, as Google has just updated its YouTube TV app help page confirming the support. </p>
<p> If you've been waiting to "smart" up your home theater's audio, Vizio may have just given you incentive to pull the trigger on a purchase with its new SmartCast sound bar collection, launched today. They start at just a paltry $180 for the basic 38" three-driver sound bar and go all the way up to $500 for fully-equipped 5.1 systems. What makes them smart? Well, they're Google Cast enabled right out of the box, meaning you can cast audio to your Vizio SmartCast speakers just like a Chromecast, and that's pretty damn cool. </p>
<p> At launch, Vizio has nine configurations available, so there's probably a setup that fits in a price:performance:practicality bracket for you. </p>

<p> In a world where competing media codecs run rampant, VLC is a lifesaver. Version 3.2 came out last year, bringing UI improvements, a new TV interface, and support for Chrome OS keyboard shortcuts among other things. Now 3.3 is ready to go, and it completes the UI revamp with a more modern Material look that's right at home on Android 11. </p>
<p> The once ubiquitous navigation drawer has become a pariah of app design over the last couple years thanks to a forced movement toward gesture navigation. We've seen plenty of apps switch to a tabbed bar at the bottom of the screen, and now VLC is joining their ranks. Along with a few other new features, the first beta of v3.3 now sports a browser screen with an updated navigation model. </p>
<p> VLC is one of the best media players. It's available on pretty much any platform and able to play almost every audio and video file type you could think of. Its UI on Android has become a bit stale over the years though, so with the recently released version 3.2.3 of the app, the developers have decided to polish up the looks while also adding new features to the Android TV and Chromebook variants. </p>
<p> Last summer, the VLC developers got fed up with Huawei and took drastic action. In a firey tweet, the VideoLAN team declared that Huawei's aggressive background task management was causing issues, so VLC was blocking those phones from downloading the app in the Play Store. It seemed like a bit of an overreaction, but the block has now been lifted. </p>
<p> VLC is one of the best media players out there — not only can it open just about every type of video and audio file in existence, but it works on just about every platform too. VLC 3.1 is now rolling out on the Play Store, and it has plenty of useful additions. </p>
<p> Huawei phones are hugely popular across vast swaths of the globe, but at least some of them are unable to download VLC from the Play Store as of today. The app developers have announced that Huawei phones are blacklisted because of an apparent tendency to kill VLC during background play. Rather than put up with 1-star reviews, the devs have just blocked those devices. </p>
<p> Last month, possibly the most-anticipated feature for VLC finally made it into the Android version - support for Chromecast. Now the feature has reached the stable branch, with the release of VLC 3.0. It's the first major version bump since 2012, and includes plenty of new features and bug fixes. </p>
<p> Google launched the Chromecast way, way back in 2013. Coming up on five years later, VLC is finally rolling out support for Google's streaming platform. The latest Play Store beta release (v2.9) includes experimental Chromecast streaming, and it (mostly) works. </p>
<p> VLC, the video player that can handle practically anything you throw at it with no config tweaking, has been updated to version 2.5, marking the first update to the stable channel of the popular media player in over a year. In addition to a lot of interface tweaks bringing it more in line with Material Design guidelines, visual changes have also come to Android TV and Auto. </p>
<p> Popular media player VLC just updated the stable branch of its Android app to 2.5, and it's one of the biggest updates in recent memory. This latest update has a dynamic new UI that better fits with Material Design guidelines, PiP mode, Android Auto support, 360-degree video support, and search improvements (including Google search integration), among a ton of other smaller features. As the first major release in over a year, we've been looking forward to it for quite a while. </p>

<p> With Android now running on over 2 billion active devices around the world, it's no surprise to see many popular apps beginning to cross the 100 million (or even 1 billion) download milestone. The most recent member of this select club is the popular VLC player for Android, which has just been downloaded over 100 million times on Android devices. As always, this counter is per device and not per account, meaning that if you've installed VLC on more than one of your devices over the years, then you've also contributed more than once towards this download count. </p>
<p> VLC isn't the most popular video player on Android — that crown would probably have to go to MX Player — but it is arguably the second most popular. </p>
<p> VLC For Android has been steadily improving over the past months, but today's beta update is a big step forward to the app that even the developers acknowledge as a "major release." </p>
<p> VLC went through a hardcore bootcamp between versions 1.3.2 and 1.5.0, emerging with enhancements all across the board. Internally, the app's code has been rewritten to be faster and to require fewer permissions especially on KitKat devices and above. Externally, the app's design has been given a small facelift to better fit Material's clean and elegant look. And functionally, VLC can now handle video playlists, auto-detect external USB devices, switch between audio and video, and more. </p>
<p> Following VLC on Android over the last couple of months has felt a little bit like a shell game. It all started in December when VideoLAN declared VLC was finally leaving behind its Beta status. The app retained the same package name, org.videolan.vlc.betav7neon, but was to be considered stable. Earlier this month, a brand new version 1.0 VLC app appeared in the Play Store with a package name and title devoid of the word 'beta.' This new app was to become the channel for stable releases, while the original listing was again repurposed for beta releases. This only lasted a few days before the new version vanished from the Play Store on devices and ceased to be installable from the web, at least for many of us. </p>
<p> Following the Android version of popular media app Video LAN Client, better known as VLC, is getting a little tricky. The Android build officially exited its beta status a couple of months ago, but now it's been split into two separate apps on the Play Store. The original app (the one installed on your phone or tablet if you've been using it for a while) is now the "beta" version again, and a new listing without the beta tag has been added. </p>
<p> Update: While both the US and Canada did not have access to VLC for Android on the Play Store at launch, some of our Canadian readers have pointed out that they have since been able to download it from there for quite some time now. As it turns out, the American release was indeed the last hold out. </p>
<p> We in the tech industry have a tendency to throw around the word "finally" perhaps a tad more often than we should. Developing things takes time, and some features that seem easy to implement on the surface actually require a great deal of effort and man hours to accomplish. </p>
<p> Aside from Windows Media Player, there is probably no single video player more widely installed on computers than VLC. It may not have the prettiest interface (or icon), but everybody eventually turns to that huge orange traffic cone, especially for file types that simply can't play in anything else. While VLC provides a mostly full compliment of features, there is one request that has gone unanswered for a while: Chromecast support. It looks like we finally have confirmation, it's happening! </p>
<p> Last week, VideoLan developer Felix Paul Kühne confirmed that Chromecast development had begun, at least for the iOS version of VLC. </p>

<p> While there are a bevy of changes expected in the project's jump from 2.2 (which itself is not yet released) to 3.0, of most interest to Android users and Google fans is the Chromecast capability. </p>
<p> Also of interest is the following snippet from the 2.2.x </p>

<p> Though voice control apps have been around for quite some time, it took Apple's release of Siri to bring the functionality to the mainstream. Now, competing manufacturers are trying to push out similar services. Samsung's first to the punch with a Vlingo-based "S Voice" service, though it remains to be seen how well it works. </p>
<p> Second only to Google Voice Search in terms of popularity on Android, Vlingo received a major update today. What's new? The entire UI has been streamlined into a much more intuitive list format that makes learning Vlingo's various voice command capabilities, or quickly accessing them, a breeze. </p>
<p> You can send text messages, make phone calls, find places, open apps, get directions, buy movie tickets, and more. Vlingo also includes a handy InCar mode, which you can set to activate automatically whenever your phone connects to a Bluetooth headset. </p>
<p> I recently broke down and picked up a Bluetooth headset. I needed something to talk on while driving a stick-shift or working with both my hands. I wanted to get something awesome because, honestly, it's go big or go home when it comes to Bluetooth headsets, and you get what you pay for. I paid for a Jawbone ERA, and I got the best Bluetooth experience I've ever had (and I've had every iteration of the Jawbone at one time or another). </p>
<p> The winners have been selected and contacted via email. </p>
<p> Enjoy your Vlingo licenses and look out for future AndroidPolice contests! </p>
<p> Living in Houston, you encounter some pretty horrendous traffic. Out of the 45 minutes I spend commuting(one way), about 20 are probably spent at a red light. </p>
<p> With all of that downtime it’s pretty tempting to reach over and check your latest email, or, if you’re like me, compulsively check the market for updates, but every time you do so, you’re risking injuring yourself, and those around you. </p>

<p> Hot on the heels of its competitor CrossOver, Parallels has announced that its Windows virtualization service is now available on Chrome OS for Enterprise, allowing businesses to run a full Windows emulation right on their Chromebooks. This follows months and years of preparation work, with initial teasers landing in June and August. </p>
<p> Even though Chrome OS is based on Linux (Gentoo Linux, to be exact), you can't run traditional desktop Linux applications. One solution to this problem is Crouton, a script that sets up a chroot of Ubuntu or Debian Linux on top of Chrome OS. While this does allow many people to use Chrome OS who otherwise couldn't, it's a hacky solution and requires enabling Developer Mode (which turns off most of Chrome OS' security features). </p>
<p> Virgin Mobile USA, a no-contract budget mobile U.S. retailer with plans starting at $25/mo for unlimited text/web/data and 300 minutes, has only crossed paths with Android once, with the introduction of Samsung Intercept. However, another contender, LG Optimus V, an equivalent of Optimus S on Sprint, Optimus T on T-Mobile, etc. just popped up at RadioShack.com, before even hitting Virgin's own site, which is expected to happen on February 1st. There have been reports of the device being available in some brick and mortar Virgin Mobile USA stores, but it looks like this RadioShack appearance is the first time it became available online. </p>
<p> As we previously reported, Oracle America has filed suit against Google for (primarily) patent infringement. If you're not familiar with the case, I'll quickly summarize. </p>
<p> Oracle claims Google is in violation of seven U.S. patents previously filed by Sun Microsystems as part of the Java platform. Oracle now owns Sun. The alleged infringer, more specifically, is Android. If you want a more detailed explanation, read the next paragraph. If not, look at the pretty picture and continue. </p>
<p> The patents generally relate to the Java virtual machine (JVM). Apps on your Android phone run through the Dalvik VM (DVM), a Google / Open Handset Alliance developed alternative to JVM that utilizes portions of an open source Java implementation known as Apache Harmony. </p>
<p> Them’s Fightin’ Words </p>
<p> As you may have heard, Oracle (who now own Sun and the Java programming language) filed a patent infringement suit against Google related to the use of Java on the Android platform (particularly in the Dalvik VM, details on TechCrunch if you’re interested). Google has responded to Oracle’s suit, and they are ready to make a stand: </p>
<p> We are disappointed Oracle has chosen to attack both Google and the open-source Java community with this baseless lawsuit. The open-source Java community goes beyond any one corporation and works every day to make the web a better place. We will strongly defend open-source standards and will continue to work with the industry to develop the Android platform. </p>

<p> vmware </p>
<p> About a year ago, Google announced the Android Enterprise Recommended program. It includes a list of Android devices that are ideal for business use and comply with certain guidelines (running a recent version of Android, supporting zero-touch enrollment, etc.). For companies looking to deploy a large number of phones, Google also now has a set of recommended Enterprise Mobility Management providers. </p>
<p> Chromebooks have become increasingly popular in education, thanks to their ease of use for both students and IT staff. Google is looking to expand Chromebook usage in another market - businesses. Today, the company announced Chrome Enterprise, a subscription service for managing large amounts of Chrome OS devices. </p>
<p> Using a work phone and a personal phone at the same time sucks. That's the motivator behind the Bring Your Own Device ("BYOD") trend, wherein employees use their own smartphones for work-related tasks. Most people do this anyway, but it can become a real problem if you're working with sensitive data. That's where VMware comes in. This company specializes in virtualized PCs for remote access and security, and after years of development, it's expanding into mobile with Android. Too bad it's only available on Verizon at the moment - and only on two mid-range phones at that. </p>
<p> VMware's Horizon Mobile solution works like this: your company sets up a default mobile workspace, complete with apps, security measures, and even a wallpaper if they want. </p>
<p> A few days ago, I posted about a student project at a Russian University that aims to run two or more instances of Android at the same time on a single device. It's a technology called virtualization, and we already use it on web servers and developer machines everywhere. </p>
<p> At first glance, the idea sounds interesting, but seems to lack practical uses for the majority of people. Sure, some developers will save a few hours on testing, and industrious users might want to run the latest CyanogenMod nightly ROM alongside their daily driver, but this kind of stuff doesn't really appeal to your neighbors or parents. </p>
<p> Have you been tempted by the recent onslaught of Honeycomb tablets entering the market, but forced yourself to hold back due to the lack of virtualization options available on the platform? No, neither have I (held back, that is), but these 'pro' applications always help when using a tablet, right? </p>
<p> VMWare users will be no doubt be delighted to hear about the arrival of VMWare View on the Android Market, which has been designed and developed from the ground up to give Honeycomb users the best possible experience when accessing their virtual Windows desktops on the go. </p>
<p> Currently available from the Market as a free tech preview, the application utilizes the PCoIP protocol so that you can control your computer effectively whether you're on a fast WiFi network or a slower 3G connection, as it adapts the quality of the connection depending on how much bandwidth you have available. </p>

<p> In Wordbase, you have to reach the opponents base not by traversing mountains and flanking opposing forces, but with your words. You'll get there one letter at a time, even if you have to fight dirty. It's a licentious linguistic battle, but no one ever said it'd be pretty. </p>
<p> The game board in Wordbase is essentially a giant word hunt puzzle. However, unlike those games, you can pick out words in any direction and along diagonals – the letters just have to connected to each other in some way. </p>
<p> A lot of smartphone apps are just mobile translations of a standard computer program or website - useful, but they don't really take advantage of the strengths of mobile platforms beyond the interface. Here's an app that "gets" the way people use their phones, and tricks you into expanding your vocabulary. In a good way. </p>
<p> GRE Vocab Lock will give your phone a secondary unlock screen, which consists of a vocabulary word and two possible synonyms. </p>
<p> If you've ever done a Market search for the term "dictionary," then you probably know that there is only one good choice.

<p> Vodafone </p>
<p> Despite the canceled Google I/O slated for this week, we initially assumed that the Pixel 4a would still be announced via other means any day now, but according to information from German publication Caschys Blog, the launch may have been postponed to June. Internal documents obtained from Vodafone Germany state that the carrier might start selling the phone on June 5. </p>
<p> We've already heard almost everything there is to hear about the Pixel 4a except for a rather important detail: When exactly will it be available for purchase? While we've assumed that Google planned on introducing the phone during its (now canceled) I/O conference in May, we've got some more evidence that it's indeed launching next month: German Caschys Blog got to see some internal Vodafone Germany documents stating the phone will be available through the carrier starting May 22. </p>
<p> A staggering proportion of the global population owns smartphones, but access is far from universal. Google is partnering with carrier Vodafone-Idea to bring Assistant access to users in India who either don't have smartphones or reliable mobile data in a clever, old-school way: over the phone. </p>
<p> The UK's first 5G network was switched on today by network operator EE, and the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G is the first commercially available 5G smartphone in the country. The carrier owned by the BT Group has beaten Vodafone to the punch by more than a month— its 5G rollout doesn't commence until July 3. </p>
<p> The Pixel 2 was one of the first smartphones with eSIM — a feature that allows devices to connect to cellular networks without inserting a physical SIM card. The Pixel 2 and 3 both have eSIM, but it's only used for Google Fi. That will soon change, as multiple carriers are working to support the feature. </p>
<p> Space exploration is a tricky business, especially when it comes to maintaining a strong signal to planet Earth. NASA maintains an array of communication facilities worldwide just to download data from deep-space probes. Future interplanetary missions involving multiple landers and rovers need a way to all talk to each other that doesn't involve radio, and that's where Vodafone and Nokia come in. </p>
<p> RCS is designed as the (eventual) successor to SMS and MMS, but it's a bit of a mess right now. Several carriers have their own implementations of the standard, often incompatible with each other. Google's Jibe RCS Cloud is quickly gaining ground, but there's still only one US carrier supporting it - Sprint. Now Samsung has announced its own RCS cloud. </p>
<p> Google has allowed paying for Play Store purchases through your phone carrier's bill for a while now, but it's not available on all carriers. Vodafone in Portugal just started supporting Play Store carrier billing, becoming the first carrier in the country to do so. In fact, the Google Play support page for Portugal hasn't even been updated yet. </p>
<p> It's been a while since we've seen any progress on the carrier billing front. Admittedly it's something of a niche feature - if you're using a smartphone there's a good chance that you also have a credit or debit card handy. But if for some reason you'd like to send your Play Store purchases to your wireless provider and pay them along with your bill at the end of the month, it's a handy option. Now it's available on a smattering of new carriers in Bulgaria, Estonia, Ireland, Lithuania, and Qatar. </p>

<p> Vodafone Android 2.2 </p>
<p> After Vodafone deployed an HTC Desire update last week that was full of crapware, customers responded with understandable anger. After initially standing firm on the crapware (“Vodafone 360”), Vodafone has now backed off and will remove it with the next update. The next update? Vanilla Froyo - and it’s coming in 7-10 days. </p>
<p> The surprising thing here is that the update will apparently be an unmolested version of Android 2.2 - something they elected not to do with their Nexus One update. </p>
<p> Vodafone Germany has been sending out a few interesting tweets lately, and the official word seems to be that Android 2.2 should be rolling out to Nexus One users sometime in the next few days (presumably, those are business days). Granted, we’re working with Google Translate on this one, but it’s probably safe to assume the translation is solid. </p>
<p> I’m a bit surprised there’s even a fuss at all, as the finalized FroYo update has only been rolling out to US N1 users for a short while, and no other phones have yet to receive official FroYo. </p>

<p> Despite the canceled Google I/O slated for this week, we initially assumed that the Pixel 4a would still be announced via other means any day now, but according to information from German publication Caschys Blog, the launch may have been postponed to June. Internal documents obtained from Vodafone Germany state that the carrier might start selling the phone on June 5. </p>
<p> We've already heard almost everything there is to hear about the Pixel 4a except for a rather important detail: When exactly will it be available for purchase? While we've assumed that Google planned on introducing the phone during its (now canceled) I/O conference in May, we've got some more evidence that it's indeed launching next month: German Caschys Blog got to see some internal Vodafone Germany documents stating the phone will be available through the carrier starting May 22. </p>

<p> The G5 has just been announced by LG in Barcelona prior to the start of Mobile World Congress. During the press conference, LG didn't clarify the price, availability countries, or dates of its new quirky modular flagship, but the details are starting to surface right now. </p>
<p> In the US, Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint said they plan to carry the LG G5. We're still waiting on an official confirmation from T-Mobile, but it will likely offer the phone as well. </p>
<p> HTC Sensation, the latest of HTC's European Android handsets, featuring a dual-core 1.2GHz processor, a 4.3" qHD display, 768MB of RAM, dual cameras (1080P HD 8MP on the back and 2MP on the front), and 1GB of internal storage, is now available for pre-order on Vodafone UK. </p>
<p> You can expect to get EVO 3D's younger brother for free on plans starting at £35 a month, for £99 on the £30 plan, and for £199 on the £25 plan. If all goes well, you'll have the shiny speed demon in your hands by May 19th. Not a bad deal, not a bad one at all. </p>

<p> Tonight, Google experienced some issues with its servers as multiple services were affected by disruptions, but by now, the company has confirmed that the problems are fixed. People reported that they couldn't send emails via Gmail and upload files to Drive, with thousands of reports on DownDetector.com. Google itself noted on its G Suite Status Dashboard that there were additional problems with Docs, Meet, Chat, Keep, Groups, Slides, Sites, and Voice. </p>
<p> If you've used any of Google's voice services for Assistant, Maps, and Search, you will have gotten a lengthy notice about some major changes as to how and why it collects audio of what you say. These actions are a response to last year's revelations about how humans were contracted to review those clips and how some of them got leaked. The top-line takeaway here is that every user has been opted out of data collection. </p>
<p> Google's Find My Device service is invaluable when you lose your phone while you're out and about, but it's also great if your handset disappears in the vast void that is your couch, bed, or hallway. Just hit up Google Assistant on one of your smart home speakers or displays and ask it to "Find my device." However, for people who juggle more than two phones at once (like us here at Android Police), this can quickly turn into a frustrating experience, as Google would only help you find the two most recently used phones. That has changed — the Assistant will now give you a selection of up to nine phones at a time. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/21 10:27am PDTon May 21, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/28 5:25pm PDTon May 28, 2020. </p>
<p> Google Voice has long been one of Google's most confusing and most useful products, and since becoming part of G Suite in 2018, it has started receiving a bit more love when it comes to updates. It gained a dark theme and support for VoIP calling last year. Now the service is prepping the ability to transfer ongoing calls to other numbers and contacts. </p>
<p> The latest version of Google Voice is available and it's bringing both cosmetic changes and making preparations for new features. For those that use Voice with multiple accounts, the account switcher has been repositioned to a more convenient location. A teardown also shows upcoming support for vCard attachments and Android's Car Mode, which will make it easier for users to make calls with Google Voice while driving. </p>
<p> In addition to voicemail transcription, Google Voice's strong suit is the ability to send and receive messages, check your voicemail, and even place calls from your phone or the web. The latter is particularly convenient, especially if your phone is charging or out of reach. Google has just made its app even more functional by designing a new interface that proves quick access to calls and settings. </p>
<p> Voice is quickly becoming a preferred method of search for many mobile users, and Google is responding by pushing voice features to as many of its platforms and services as it can. The latest example is voice search on Google.com for mobile web. The tech giant began rolling out the new feature this past week, but it's only available to Android users so far. </p>
<p> Android Auto is designed with simplicity and safety in mind. As such, it will not show all your notifications while you drive, but only the most important ones like navigation, weather, calls, and messages. However, the latter can only be played vocally and are limited to a few apps such as SMS, WhatsApp, and Hangouts. Until now, Google Voice wasn't supported in Android Auto, which meant incoming texts wouldn't appear on your car's screen. The company is finally fixing this thanks to an update that notifies you when receiving Google Voice messages. </p>
<p> A ton of Google apps have already gotten Material redesigns, and Voice is the latest to join the party. Following yesterday's Gmail redesign, several readers have tipped us off on a new and improved UI in Voice. And yes, we have the APK for you guys to download. </p>
<p> The Pandora app is about to get easier to control, provided you don't mind yelling at your phone. Like everything else under the sun, the app is getting voice controls. Thanks to a partnership with SoundHound, you'll be able to ask Pandora to play different tracks, modify playlists, and more. </p>

<p> voice access </p>
<p> When it comes to accessibility on Android, Google's Voice Access is one of the hallmark options to make it easier to use your phone. Late last year, we saw the big 3.0 release, which brought a whole slew of new features, so today's update is small in comparison. It is, however, still important since it adds support for German, French, Italian, and Spanish. </p>
<p> Though the smartphone market is relatively mature (some might even say stagnant), there's been a notable lack of progress on accessibility. The simple fact is that not everyone can easily manipulate a smartphone or tablet's touchscreen, and there aren't a lot of cheap or free ways to make it easier. That's no doubt why, even in a low-profile beta, Google's voice command navigation app Voice Access climbed to more than a million downloads on the Play Store over the past two years. </p>
<p> It was almost a year ago that Google posted the session list for I/O 2015 with an interesting "voice access" talk. That was eventually removed from the schedule and we didn't hear anything about it in Android M. Now, Google has announced Voice Actions as a beta in the Play Store (Android 5.0 and higher). Once you join up, you can install the app and literally control your entire phone by voice. It's incredibly cool. </p>

<p> voice actions </p>
<p> Third party apps and services have been able to connect with the Google Assistant in the States since late last year, through the Actions on Google platform. Compatibility with more languages and regions was promised, and a couple of months ago we got support for it here in the UK, too. Australia is next up. Starting today, developers and businesses down under can integrate their apps with the Google Assistant. </p>
<p> The Google assistant makes for a pretty awesome companion on the Pixel phones and Google Home, but it's still young and feels constrained by the very limited number of things it can do outside of Google's sandbox of supported services. During the October 4th announcement, Google declared plans to open up the platform in early December for developers to build their own services. Staying true to that schedule, the Actions on Google platform opened the door today, allowing developers to integrate their services. Google is also launching an early access program to begin testing new features and upcoming expansions. </p>
<p> Today's announcements by Google have certainly given us a lot to look at in terms of new hardware and features – and possibly a case of sticker shock. But while the show was mostly dominated by new gadgets and demos of Google assistant, there was a really important addition for developers (and ultimately users) at the tail end of the event. Google intends to turn assistant into a major ecosystem for apps and services by opening up the platform to developers. </p>
<p> The platform is called "Actions on Google" and it will allow developers to deliver custom experiences through Google assistant. Google assistant can already take advantage of many existing capabilities like app indexing, deep linking, and even the Voice Interaction API to provide helpful answers and services. </p>
<p> YouTube's Offline Playback feature was first introduced alongside Music Key back in November, finally giving people a way to store a (limited) selection of videos for trips into areas with poor connectivity, or just to avoid using up capped data plans. While it has remained mostly unchanged in the last 8 months, the latest update finally brings a few modifications. The interface is now a bit more informative and uniform, and there's a new low-quality option (which is actually a good thing). A teardown also revealed some big improvements to the voice command interface that has been in the works for a while. </p>
<p> After the launch of Music Key in November, we've had good reason to expect quite a bit from YouTube. We've seen things like 60 fps live streaming, 360-degree videos with cardboard support, and big updates to the Kids and Creator Studio apps – and that's just some of the stuff from the last two months. We also know there's plenty still to come, particularly an ad-free subscription model. The latest update doesn't seem to deliver any new features, not unless Google is planning to flip a switch server-side, but it gives a few hints about what to expect in the future. </p>
<p> joaomgcd's apps are usually about pushing your phone to do more with just your voice and some Google Now command integration, and Touchless Chat is no exception. The app takes the idea of interacting with your phone via voice commands and applies it to one area where I personally wished Google Now and Wear were better: sending messages to your contacts (ie initiating a conversation instead of just replying). </p>
<p> There are many layers to Touchless Chat and many ways of initiating a chat with a contact, but before we get into that, you'll need to give the app some permissions, mainly for accessibility, notification access, and device administrator. That's </p>
<p> Over on the Android Developer's Google+ page an awesome new feature for Google's voice search was just announced. A small selection of applications will now open directly when using certain voice commands. For example, you can now say, "Ok Google, find houses near me on Zillow," and Google will automatically start the Zillow app, showing a map of properties near your current location (this also works with the applications for Trulia and Realtor.com). Previously a query like this would have directed you to Zillow's mobile site and given you a link to download Zillow's app. </p>
<p> Let me give you a few more examples of what you can do with the new voice commands. </p>
<p> A little less than one year ago, I called the OnePlus One "the best flagship phone you can't buy" in my initial review. The phone had some impressive hardware at an amazing price, and in many ways it still does, but the system of invitations and qualifications built around actually buying the One made obtaining the device an exercise in frustration. It's taken them eleven months (and what seems like dozens of separate promotions and half-measures), but you can finally order a OnePlus One without an invitation of any kind starting today. </p>
<p> IR ports are becoming a thing again with flagship devices from Samsung and HTC now commonly sporting them. They aren't used for terribly slow data transfers like back in the old days, but for controlling TVs and stuff. The built-in apps on the phones are okay, but Smart IR Remote is in a league of its own, and now it's added voice commands through Google Now. Take a gander at this video and be impressed. </p>
<p> The app needs to be added as an accessibility service so it can pipe commands through Google, but that's nothing to worry about. When that's done, you can start talking to your phone to control the TV. </p>
<p> Last week I posted a teardown of the Settings app from XE 16. That was really just a teaser, because this update is huge. This time I'm ripping into the guts of every app on Glass. That's over 100 apks (counting multiple version updates from the last month), and there's plenty to see. I'm not going to waste time on a long intro, you know what you're here for! </p>
<p> New APKs </p>
<p> One of the biggest changes to hit Glass with the update to XE 16 can be seen without even cracking open any apks. The total number of apps went up from 44 to 52. </p>

<p> It was never going to be easy for Microsoft to have a voice assistant on Android when the Google Assistant was out there, and it looks like the company has finally thrown in the towel. Beginning in early 2021, support for Cortana will be ended on Android, iOS, and a couple of small platforms. Cortana had already been phased out in several countries a few months ago, but this change will be global. </p>
<p> Amazon is working on something called "Alexa for Apps," a new feature that will better integrate the company's smart digital assistant with the apps on your phone via voice commands. And we don't just mean asking Alexa to start an app, we mean further passing details from your question or command to the app itself. </p>
<p> Amazon's voice assistant works on a ton of devices from TVs to tablets. There's even an Alexa app on Android that lets you talk to Alexa instead of your default voice assistant. Support for full Alexa voice interaction came in 2018, but it's always required a press of the big blue button — until now. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/21 8:43am PDTon Apr 21, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/04 1:48pm PDTon May 4, 2020. </p>
<p> There's still a little bit of magic every time you say "OK Google" and all your smart speakers, displays, and Android handsets line up to respond with a cacophony of lights and buzzes. But while that makes for a fun little display, sometimes we wish that all these smart devices weren't so sensitive, and that things like Google Home were better about knowing when you were talking to them in particular. Thankfully, it looks like a new "Hey Google" sensitivity setting is about to arrive, letting users control how responsive they want their devices to be. </p>
<p> These days, you can control most of your smart home using only your voice — Google Assistant lets you adjust your bed, mow the lawn, open your closets, start your Xbox, control your TV, and so much more. Routers and networks are the latest new addition to the Assistant's library of natively supported actions, allowing for things like reboots, software updates, and parental controls on third-party networking devices. </p>
<p> Not even a year after the great John Legend lent his voice to Google Assistant, it's been made clear that his graces are indeed only temporary. Google has announced that his cameo voice will no longer be available from March 23. </p>
<p> With Google Assistant pre-installed on any Android phone (and Siri on iPhones), you should think you already have all tools at your disposal when you want to yell at your phone to control your audio playback. However, Spotify seems to think that it needs its own solution. App reverse-engineer Jane Manchun Wong managed to activate a hidden settings panel in the music app that will let you enable a "Hey Spotify" feature you can use while the app is open and on your screen. </p>
<p> Back in 2017, researchers in China reported on a clever way to access a digital assistant, like Google Assistant or Siri, by using inaudible ultrasonic sound waves. Now a new team at Washington University in St. Louis have been working on similar technology, and their version is even more capable (and scary) than the original. </p>
<p> We've known since June that Microsoft was working on integrating Alexa and Google Assistant with Xbox in lieu of its own voice assistant, Cortana. With Alexa support already up and running on Xbox One, it's now time for Google Assistant to get in on the action. </p>
<p> Until recently, you could only officially talk to Google Assistant on your Smart Display in nine languages. With the addition of Italian, we're now at ten. </p>

<p> Whenever people discuss digital voice assistants, the conversation usually ends with the Google Assistant triumphing over Apple's Siri. I haven't owned an iOS device since I sold my childhood iPod Touch, but earlier this summer, I took the plunge and bought an iPhone 11 to see what I'd been missing — and to check out Siri's smarts for myself. It's much better than I expected, and in fact, there is at least one area where Siri makes the Google Assistant look like an off-key cover band: music. </p>
<p> If you think smart speakers aren't discreet enough, mounting them directly on the wall is a good solution. Some accessories let you do that, but they're not necessarily ideal. Thankfully, Amazon has the solution with its Eco Flex wall-mountable smart speaker, which it announced back in September. The product normally sells for $25, but it's now down to just $17.50 </p>
<p> Back in 2017, researchers in China reported on a clever way to access a digital assistant, like Google Assistant or Siri, by using inaudible ultrasonic sound waves. Now a new team at Washington University in St. Louis have been working on similar technology, and their version is even more capable (and scary) than the original. </p>
<p> Amazon and Google's plays for user data have pushed the battle of the virtual assistants into the living rooms, kitchens, and bedrooms via the smart speaker. Sonos, which makes a number of audio products compatible with both Alexa and Google Assistant, feels it has been squeezed by both companies of its intellectual property in the middle of this war. However, The New York Times reports the company has decided to target only Google in two federal lawsuits and has sought sales injunctions for its speakers, smartphones, and laptops. </p>
<p> Echo Dots are undoubtedly convenient, thanks to their compact size and the features they offer. However, they're designed to lie flat on a surface and don't easily fit if you'd rather place them on a wall plug. There are accessories that let you do that, but they're not necessarily ideal. Thankfully, Amazon announced the Echo Flex wall-mountable smart speaker back in September, which is now selling on the retailer's site. </p>
<p> Google's speech recognition error rate is getting lower and lower - yesterday, the company said it's now under 5% and has dropped from 8.5% this time last year. And I find that to be more and more the case in my own use: Google seems to recognize almost everything I throw at it now, even when I add Lebanese/Arabic names from my contacts list that I wouldn't expect it to get right. </p>
<p> But if you're wondering how Google's speech recognition fares in comparison to other voice assistants, Wired has made a video in conjunction with Andy Wood and Matt Kirshen (from Probably Science) to show you just that. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/voice-calling/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17558676" filename="voice-calling">
<p> This story was originally published 2020/07/22 4:09am PDTon Jul 22, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/24 7:11am PDTon Jul 24, 2020. </p>
<p> Amid an economy-crushing pandemic, AT&T decided that now was a good time to send a scaremongering email to many of its customers, claiming that their phone "is not compatible with the new network and you need to replace it to continue receiving service." The email conveniently omits that this message is regarding a change that won't take place until February 2022, providing only a link that later calls out this change linked to the decommissioning of AT&T's legacy 3G network. </p>
<p> Yesterday was a busy day with the official announcement of Android Oreo and our sun playing a short game of peekaboo behind the moon. Yesterday also saw the release of a brand new version of the Google app to the beta channel. After a bit of digging, there aren't any notable changes jumping out at us, but a teardown of the APK provides a monstrous amount of information about a mystery device called Bisto. There's plenty here, so let's dig straight into the juicy bits! </p>
<p> With Amazon enabling voice calling and messaging on its Echo line-up, the rumor of the Echo also gaining intercom ability that had circulated back in March was bound to come true sooner than later. And it's now here so all of you multi-Echo households can start, erm, echoing each other from room to room. </p>
<p> In the latest Amazon Alexa app (v2.0.1216.2), you can enable the option by turning on Drop In from your household in your Echo's settings and making sure your device has a friendly name so that people in other rooms can easily specify which Echo they want to contact you on. </p>
<p> Google Duo's audio calling feature started rolling out at the end of last month to users in Brazil after the company confirmed the option would be coming way earlier last August. Today, Googler Justin Uberti announced on Twitter that audio calls are now available worldwide to all Duo users. </p>
<p> An update to the Google Phone app came out a few days ago, but left many people wondering what the changes were. This version doesn't have a whole lot to show off, but a close examination does reveal a couple of interesting things both active and hidden inside the apk. Users now have the option to easily share voicemails as regular files, meaning you can email them to friends or easily stash them in cloud storage. From the perspective of a teardown, Google has also added the first signs of RCS support, meaning we can look forward to some new calling features to come along in the future. </p>
<p> Facebook has been slowly rolling out VoIP calling to its Messenger app in an effort to make it the single, unified source for all your communication needs (before Google can). Today, it apparently took another baby step forward by granting UK users of the mobile app the ability to connect for free (minus data charges where applicable) to anyone they're friends with. </p>
<p> At the moment the service doesn't seem to have rolled out to all users yet, and it may even still be a bit buggy (the slow expansion is partially to conduct tests, after all). However, the important thing is it's coming. </p>
<p> While roaming around Google I/O and looking for answers to numerous questions you guys posed, I ran into Wei Huang, the tech lead on Google Talk for Android. Yup, the same guy who announced video chat two weeks ago on the Google Mobile blog. Here are some questions I had for Wei, echoing many of you guys: </p>
<p> Is video chat coming to other devices than the Nexus S and if so, when? </p>
<p> It's understandable why the Nexus One has no video chat (although 1-way video chat would still be better than none), but why did it receive no voice chat with the Android 2.3.4 upgrade? </p>

<p> With Allo shuttered, Google has decided to focus its messaging efforts on Messages and RCS (for the time being, at least). Since Google Messages was originally meant as a simple SMS app, the company has had to do a fair bit of work to make it a true competitor against established players like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. To reach feature parity with them, Messages is testing the addition of an instantly accessible microphone button to help you communicate via voice more easily. </p>
<p> The Fortnite mobile beta is still limited to Samsung users and those that have received beta invitations. Since development on the title is a constant, it's no surprise to see a new patch rolling out today. The big news is that this patch brings with it voice chat for Android. You can also expect to find a new capture-the-flag mode called Getaway that will only be available for a limited time. </p>
<p> Between the Chrome extension, the Chrome app, Gmail, Inbox, and Google+, there are plenty of ways you can sign in to Hangouts while you're at a computer. But maybe you need one more. Today Google has launched hangouts.google.com. You're welcome. </p>
<p> Hangouts' dedicated website provides a single obvious way to access your contacts list and start chatting, as the URL is one you could probably guess. The site lets you open up multiple conversations at once just as you've been doing in Gmail since the dawn of time. You can also start group conversations, place a voice call, or fire up the webcam. </p>
<p> Online gamers know the value of communication, believe it or not. For every twelve-year-old cursing into his mic like a sailor with a stubbed toe, a dozen are connected to third-party communication apps and coordinating efforts behind the scenes. That's actually a bit tricky for PC games - you either need some kind of overlay or you have to switch programs to manage your connection. Curse, a service with more than a million registered users, hopes to fix that. </p>

<p> voice commands </p>
<p> Google's smart home speakers already don't have the best privacy-conscious track record. Back in 2017, our very own Artem Russakovskii had his Home Mini record every word he said for days on end, resulting in Google permanently removing top touch functionality from all Home Minis. Even when hotword functionality is working as intended, we often assume that a user has to be within earshot to actually control one of these devices. It turns out that's not the case, thanks to a new hack that uses laser beams to remotely interact with smart speakers. </p>
<p> LG is getting set to roll out an update to its SmartThinQ app that could change the way people use its smart home appliances: it will incorporate Google Assistant to recognize vocal commands for its Wi-Fi enabled laundry machines, refrigerators, ovens, dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, air conditioners, and other devices. </p>
<p> After teasing a navigation-optimized Google Assistant for Maps at I/O 2018, Google is now rolling out the feature to Android users. The new version of Google Assistant in Maps is smaller, less distracting, and executes more commands in the background. </p>
<p> While Essential's first device has a cult following among those who prioritize quick Android updates, it became clear in May that it would never see a follow-up. A report from Bloomberg revealed that the company had canceled a second Essential Phone and put itself up for sale. However, over the past several months, the company has quietly chugged along, continuing to push out lightning-fast security patches. Now, a new report from Bloomberg states that the company is indeed working on a second device — but it's not at all like its first product. According to the publication's tipsters, the handset is an anti-smartphone with a small screen that relies primarily on voice commands. </p>
<p> Judging by the Google Assistant help forums, Twitter, and Reddit, a whole lot of people are having trouble getting their phones to respond to voice commands. Twelve of the 20 top posts are complaining about the problem on several different device models and even in several languages. Google says it's on the case, though. </p>
<p> YouTube's app for Android TV hasn't seen a lot of updates since it switched over to the web wrapper as an interface. However, each new version usually brings something of some importance. The latest release comes with a couple of notable enhancements, including performance improvements, automatic resume after switching apps, and voice commands via Google Assistant. For some people running Android Oreo, there may also be new "personalized channels" appearing in the homescreen. </p>
<p> Most voice assistants can make calls and send texts without the user having to touch his/her screen, but that wasn't true for Cortana on Android until now. The latest update adds this capability, and even though it's nothing groundbreaking, it's sure to make your life just a little bit more convenient if you use Cortana regularly. </p>
<p> Google sometimes stealthily deploys new features here and there in Assistant without telling us, but today's update is a big one with some fanfare. There are changes on the way to media playback, Assistant-enabled devices, and subscriptions. Some of these features are rolling out now, and others will be live in the near future. It's a colossal Assistant update overall. </p>
<p> You just got a Google Home, and after unwrapping it and setting it up, you've asked about the weather, requested a few songs to play, and set a timer for 5 minutes to see how it rings. Now what? </p>
<p> I've been covering Google's smart speaker for more than a year now and I've owned a couple of Google Homes for about a year, yet I still feel like I'm not using them to their full potential. Every week brings new features and integrations that make it tough to remember all that can be done, so for those of you who don't know what to ask beyond playing music, those who are getting confused by hearing a different voice sometimes from the speaker, those who are always wondering why some actions work for them but not other members of their household, this is the most accurate tutorial I can write right now. </p>
<p> Now that Google has added multi-user support, the ability to set reminders, and other key functionality to the Google Home, there's not much to complain about. One remaining issue was that you could only say one command at a time. If you wanted to turn off the lights and play something on your TV, you would have to say "turn off the lights," wait for the Home to respond, and then follow up with the casting command. </p>

<p> Google will discontinue Play Music this month, and as such, the company is hard at work improving YouTube Music. One of these enhancements revolves around casting and Google Assistant. Songs you ask the Assistant to play while you cast will now show up in your YouTube Music queue on your phone, and when you start playback via the Assistant, you can tap into the queue by casting to the speaker or display in question. </p>
<p> The coronavirus pandemic ruffled Chrome and Chrome OS releases quite a bit, so Google paused updates for a short time, even omitting version 82 altogether. But now the company is getting back on track and has announced the release of Chrome OS 83. It'll start rolling out to first people this week, and it brings a whole slew of neat improvements to the table. None of them are as big as the addition of gesture navigation we've seen in version 81, though. </p>
<p> These days, you can control most of your smart home using only your voice — Google Assistant lets you adjust your bed, mow the lawn, open your closets, start your Xbox, control your TV, and so much more. Routers and networks are the latest new addition to the Assistant's library of natively supported actions, allowing for things like reboots, software updates, and parental controls on third-party networking devices. </p>
<p> With Google Assistant pre-installed on any Android phone (and Siri on iPhones), you should think you already have all tools at your disposal when you want to yell at your phone to control your audio playback. However, Spotify seems to think that it needs its own solution. App reverse-engineer Jane Manchun Wong managed to activate a hidden settings panel in the music app that will let you enable a "Hey Spotify" feature you can use while the app is open and on your screen. </p>
<p> Over time, major TV, movie, and video service providers have been rolling out Google Assistant voice support so that users can access their favorite content on Chromecasts and Google Home smart displays simply by speaking. Just last month, Sling added its service to Google's growing list of companies, and today, Hulu has officially hopped onto the roster, as well. </p>
<p> Cutting the cord is a difficult decision, but Sling makes it easier. Its service offers live TV so there's no need to give up on football, your local stations, or the 24-hour news cycle. Sling has supported Chromecast for some time now, and today the company is adding voice control options as well as the ability to stream on your Google Assistant smart displays. </p>
<p> We've known since June that Microsoft was working on integrating Alexa and Google Assistant with Xbox in lieu of its own voice assistant, Cortana. With Alexa support already up and running on Xbox One, it's now time for Google Assistant to get in on the action. </p>
<p> The Ecobee4 has been our go-to smart thermostat here at Android Police for quite a while. Its connectivity with various smart home protocols and integrated Alexa voice controls round off the device's temperature regulation capabilities, making it one of the best smart thermostats around. Today, Ecobee has announced the successor to its successful two-year-old product, and true to the proverb "if it ain't broke, don't fix it," not much has changed. The thermostat comes with a modest redesign, the same Alexa integration, improved processing power, and better sound. </p>
<p> IFA 2018 may be over, but there are still some interesting tidbits of news worth mentioning. One of the stands we visited briefly in Berlin last week was that of German Autolabs to see an interesting new product. It may resemble a Nest Thermostat, but Chris is actually a digital assistant for your car. </p>

<p> voice controls </p>
<p> Voice controls are easily one of the best things to have happened to the living room. Gone are the times when we needed separate 'clickers' for every device, and even the universal remote's days are numbered. Now you can even add Hulu on Android TV to the growing list of "yell-compatible" apps, via the Google Assistant. </p>
<p> A couple of weeks ago, I got my hands on Google Home and immediately set out to use it and record my initial impressions. Now that I've given this odd little device a chance to prove its worth in my home, the time has come to finish the review. Out of the gate, I must confess to a little personal surprise at just how little my opinions have changed from the first 24 hours I had to spend with the device. As such, I'm not going to repeat everything I said in my first post. This is an addendum. I will touch on all of the subjects again and add details where there is more to say – because there is still a lot to say. </p>
<p> Google Home preorders have started arriving and interested consumers can head down to certain brick & mortar stores to pick one up starting today. I've been messing with Home for a little while and I feel like there's already quite a bit to say about it. </p>
<p> Today Amazon unveiled what may be its most peculiar hardware to date, and it's not what you would expect. It's... wait, did you hear that? </p>
<p> Sorry, it was just an Echo. </p>
<p> Amazon Echo is a cylindrical speaker that responds to your voice commands. If you want music, tell it what to play. If you want to know the weather, ask it the question. It can handle alarms, pull up information from Wikipedia, or update you on the news. All you have to do is say its name and ask. </p>

<p> The idea of essentially snatching Google Now or Siri out of a phone and shoving them into a standalone product is an interesting one. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/voice-input/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17559507" filename="voice-input">
<p> voice input </p>
<p> The speech input interface that is seen in apps like YouTube and the Play Store hasn't been updated for some time. If I'm remembering correctly, the last time it was revised was when the new Google logo replaced the old one, but it had remained largely the same for years before that as well. The company is now testing a Material-based UI that is a much better match for Android's current aesthetic. </p>
<p> Many of us were happy to see the recent addition of a keyboard input method in Assistant and the setting to choose it as a preferred method. After all, many of us don't like to shout at our phones all the time because we either need some privacy, we're often in public, or we may simply not feel comfortable talking to an inanimate object. </p>
<p> But what if the keyboard is your preferred input method and there's that one time where you would rather use voice instead? Maybe your hands are wet or dirty, maybe you're carrying something with your other hand and you can't easily type your request with just one, or I don't know... </p>
<p> There's a subtle change to the Android voice input system, and you probably already have it on your phone without realizing. Some time ago, users started reporting that a delete button had appeared on the dictation keyboard, and now we're seeing it too. The most likely cause is an update to the Google app, which contains the voice settings. </p>
<p> Have you noticed that sometimes your Nexus 5 reverts to the old Ice Cream Sandwich-style pop-up for voice dictation in some apps, as opposed to the less disruptive "endless dictation" on-the-keyboard style? You're not alone. Our fearless leader Artem found that his N5's microphone icon was missing from the default keyboard, and using contextual mic icons (in search boxes and other places) caused the aforesaid behavior. It was also affecting third-party keyboards like SwiftKey. </p>
<p> As it turns out, at least some Nexus devices and updates are being sent out with the "Google voice typing" option disabled in the Language and Input menu. </p>
<p> I've known my wife for five years now, and I still struggle to remember her phone number. The only numbers I know are those I can recall from before getting my first mobile phone, and since I have lost touch with nearly everyone from back then, that has largely been reduced down to immediate family members. For everyone else, there's a People app, and all I've had to do to dial them is start typing their name. Now I don't even have to make that much effort. If you join the Google Search field trial, you can find a contact's information simply by asking your phone. </p>
<p> Perhaps the most time-saving key on the Android keyboard is the microphone, but using it is more hassle than it's worth when certain words just refuse to be recognized. More often than not, these words are contact names. Luckily, there is a way to trick your phone into recognizing even the most tongue-twisting of names. If you're tired of your phone turning "Demonte Jones" into "Demon's bones," just teach it to recognize the latter as the former. Granted, this might be a problem when you're texting a friend the location of a secret item in your favorite MMORPG. </p>
<p> The instructions are pretty straightforward: </p>
<p> Open up the People app and find your desired contact. </p>
<p> I make no bones of the fact that I find 3rd party voice assistants to be increasingly redundant, especially with the arrival of Google Now on Jelly Bean. </p>
<p> But Google Now doesn't do certain things. One of those things has annoyed me since the early days of Google's Voice Actions: you can't make calendar events through voice input. And as a person that absolute despises digital calendars, this is something of a "must have" feature. Creating a calendar event in an app, to me, is like having a root canal - in that I wish I could be unconscious for the entire experience. </p>
<p> One of Swype keyboard's most glaring omissions, especially apparent to those of us with Android 2.1/2.2 is the missing voice input button. </p>
<p> The voice input button, present on the stock keyboard when typing in any text field, lets you utilize Android's speech-to-text capabilities and works surprisingly well. I sure missed it when I installed Swype. </p>
<p> The good news is: Swype has been listening, and the voice input button is coming soon. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/voicemail/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17557256" filename="voicemail">
<p> With Hangouts on its way out, Google Fi users might have been wondering how they would access their messages on the web. We learned from a teardown back in May that Messages for Web would be getting Google Fi-specific features, and it looks like this new experience is now rolling out. </p>
<p> Google has silently taken the first step in disentangling Google Fi from Google Voice, with the stated goal of supporting both on a single Google account. Late last year, the company revealed that it was changing how Fi would store voicemails, separating them from Google Voice, but keeping them accessible otherwise in all the same locations as before. </p>
<p> Google Voice takes your phone subscription to the next level, thanks to advanced features such as voicemail transcription and web texting and calling. The service can also send you these transcripts by text or email, so you can read them even when you're out of data. Unfortunately, Google is removing the ability to receive these by SMS. Additionally, it's turning off the option to send SMS from its legacy web interface and Chrome Extension. </p>
<p> You've been able to send video messages on Google Duo since March. The current implementation isn't particularly elegant, though; it's more like leaving a voicemail than intentionally sending a message. The app will receive an update this week that simplifies messaging, eliminating the need to call your recipient before sending. </p>
<p> The Google Phone app is getting an update this afternoon for all of the phones out there that use it. We haven't noticed any new changes on the surface, but clues from a teardown show that Google is preparing a call screening feature so you can more easily differentiate between legitimate and unwanted callers. There are also preparations for a new feature to simplify recording voicemail greetings right on your phone. </p>
<p> Good things are happening with Google Voice. While the app normally stays fairly quiet, the last few months have shown a lot of positive attention is going into the service. The surface-level changes in this update aren't too major, but a teardown shows that users will soon get a vastly improved voicemail system that features on-device recording and support for multiple messages. </p>
<p> Duo's getting a handy new feature today that allows users to leave messages when their calls go unanswered. If the person on the receiving end misses or declines a call, the caller will now be able to record a clip to be reviewed later. </p>
<p> The latest version of Duo began rolling out to users this morning, but there haven't been any visible changes popping up in the live app. As is tradition, especially with Duo, a teardown does turn up a few of the changes we can look forward to in the future. This time, we're looking at yet another camera effect, but this one may actually stick around and make it to users. There is also follow-up on some previous camera effects and the voicemail / videomail feature discussed in previous teardowns. </p>
<p> A new version of the Google Phone app began rolling out this weekend with a few bug fixes and some new hints about what may be coming in the future. We've checked for the *infamous 'switch to video call' feature* that was spotted during the October 4th event, but it still doesn't appear to be operational yet. However, a teardown of this update reveals that the Phone app will automatically correct prefixes when you make a call to international numbers and it may begin offering voicemail transcriptions on behalf of carriers. </p>
<p> Hot on the heels of Allo's update over the weekend, Duo is now out with a new version of its own. Like Allo, its adaptive icon has been retouched to get rid of the infamous dinner plate look. While there aren't any other changes to the app on the surface, a teardown provides us with clues that Duo may support signing in with and being contacted through your Google account. </p>

<p> Step by step, WhatsApp has been implementing features to combat the uncontrollable spread of fake or even just sugar-coated news on its platform. Today's update to the beta app includes one more measure to help monitor forwarded messages, but it also brings one very handy feature for voice notes. </p>
<p> Instagram's foray into messaging is slowly expanding. What began as a simple messaging section for users to communicate without leaving the image-sharing app is now a quasi full-fledged messenger with support for GIFs, tight integration with Stories, video calling, disappearing media, and more. The latest addition that began rolling out yesterday is voice messages. </p>
<p> You know what has puzzled me for months? You can say, "OK Google, send a message," and it will listen and transcribe everything you say, but in apps that already have a voice/audio messaging feature, why go through all the trouble? Or at least why not offer the option to just send the audio clip of what you said, as it is, without trying to transcribe it? That would work wonderfully in WhatsApp (and Telegram, Viber, Allo, and other apps) in situations where you either think the speech-to-text won't pick up on some of your words or where you want to say something in a language that isn't supported. </p>
<p> Google Allo is clearly one of the most audacious apps to be released by the company in recent times. Not only is it a departure from what Google has long been invested in doing with Hangouts, but it's also trying to catch up in one swift release with competing messaging apps that have been around the block for many years and have had time to perfect their approach. </p>
<p> So it seems logical that the Allo team got some "inspiration" from other messaging services. I can think of a couple of reasons why many of the screenshots we've obtained of Allo eerily resemble WhatsApp — and maybe other messaging apps too (I wouldn't know, I only use WhatsApp so it's the only one I can compare these against). </p>
<p> It's nice to finally have Facebook pay at least a little attention to its mobile apps for a change. Today, the social networking giant is rolling out an incremental update that brings a couple of new features. Of course, there's the big one: remember that new voice messaging thing that Messenger got? Now the regular app has it, too. </p>
<p> Here's the full changelog: </p>
<p> What's in this version: </p>
<p> • Open and view photos faster • Share your friends' stories to timelines, pages and groups • Send voice messages when you have more to say </p>
<p> The bulk of the new changes will likely be of little consequence, but if you've ever been mildly frustrated by your inability to share a friend's posts to different pages or groups, your life will get just a smidge easier. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/08/19 5:30pm PDTon Aug 19, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/22 5:08am PDTon Oct 22, 2020. </p>
<p> We aren't at the point yet where every Android phone is able to transcribe voice calls in real time, but what Google is doing with its video chat service Duo is a good first step: the app is now enabling captions for recorded voice and video messages. </p>
<p> Do you trade more voice messages than texts with your contacts? You may appreciate the ability to do that with the help of Google Assistant as it gains dedicated command branches for sending clips. That means you can even do it hands-free while driving! </p>
<p> With Allo shuttered, Google has decided to focus its messaging efforts on Messages and RCS (for the time being, at least). Since Google Messages was originally meant as a simple SMS app, the company has had to do a fair bit of work to make it a true competitor against established players like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. To reach feature parity with them, Messages is testing the addition of an instantly accessible microphone button to help you communicate via voice more easily. </p>
<p> Ever since the controversy arose surrounding Google training its voice recognition technology using human contractors, barely a week goes by without another company admitting to the same. While the practice doesn't come as a surprise to many familiar with the underlying technology, no company thought of clearly stating what they were doing, which is not a good idea considering rising privacy awareness among customers and regulators. Bloomberg found out that the same is true for Facebook Messenger, affecting users who turned on voice-to-text for audio messages. </p>
<p> A new version of Allo is rolling out just in time for the holidays. If you're thinking about singing Christmas carols or wishing somebody a happy new year, things are going to get a little more interesting thanks to the latest update. Your audio messages will now be automatically transcribed to text, so people can decide when to listen and have some idea of what they're going to be hearing. There's also a clue that may suggest threaded conversations will be supported. We're still poking around for other changes, but let us know in the comments if you stumble across anything else. </p>
<p> We've covered a lot of what Google Allo can do as a messaging application, but we haven't yet scratched the surface of one of its most interesting features: Assistant. It lives as a standalone chat, but also as a bot ready to answer any question inside your other conversations (not the Incognito ones though, as we've said before) by just mentioning @google. </p>
<p> Since Assistant is an evolution of Google Now / OK Google commands, and since Allo can send voice messages, there's a nifty feature you can easily deduce from the combination of the two: Assistant will interpret your voice messages in Allo. It's </p>

<p> The Pixel 2 XL has suffered from several issues since its launch, both hardware and software-related, just like pretty much any other consumer product of its kind. The latest bug to come to light is a curious one that affects the sound output level of a voice clip sent via a messaging app. According to a number of users on this Pixel User Community thread, this issue is limiting the volume level when recording voice messages on the Pixel 2 XL. </p>
<p> When you send a voice clip recorded on a phone suffering from the bug, the recipient gets a message with very low volume, even when their phone is turned up all the way. </p>

<p> voice navigation </p>
<p> It's one thing to hop behind the wheel and go where life takes you. It's another thing to go where T-Pain takes you. But now you have that option. </p>
<p> In the Venn diagram of mobile users, the circle marked "rabid Shaq fans" and the one marked "active Waze users" must have a pretty tiny crossover section. But if you do happen to use Waze on a regular basis and you have the special extended DVD edition of both Kazaam and Steel boldly displayed on your shelf, today is your day. Waze has announced that the company is celebrating the start of the NBA Playoffs later this week by adding official Shaquille O'Neal voice narration to the map app's navigation service. </p>
<p> Earlier today, Google India uploaded a video to YouTube demoing a long-awaited feature for the Indian market: voice navigation in Maps. However, mere minutes after the video went live, Google made it private - but not before some users caught a glimpse of what was to come. </p>
<p> It's still unknown when Google will make the service available to the public, but considering a video has already been uploaded, we won't be surprised to see it officially announced within the next day or two. </p>
<p> As noted by all the comments below, Voice Navigation is now live in India. Go somewhere! </p>
<p> Update: Google just posted the official announcement on the Maps blog, along with a few more new tidbits: bike maps for New Zealand, Street View for over 150 university campuses, and a nifty video featuring some of the interesting things that can be done with Maps. </p>

<p> Anyone who's used WhatsApp's voice recording knows that it can be a little annoying: you tap the microphone and have to keep it tapped while you're talking then release it to send the message or slide to the left to cancel it. </p>

<p> Using your phone while on the road is extremely dangerous. A safer way to stay connected is to use a hands-free kit. This is great if you want to make calls, but less helpful if you're dependent on the myriad of messaging services currently in use. </p>
<p> Enter Drivemode, which has been kicking around the Google Play Store for some time now. At a very fundamental level, it provides a gesture interface for a number of apps and system functions, essentially allowing you to safely use your phone without even looking at the screen. It also supports the composition and sending of SMS messages through voice recognition. </p>
<p> When you make a voice search or any other voice input on Android, there's a complex process that goes on behind the scenes. Your voice is recorded, transmitted to Google's servers, analyzed and converted into a text string, then either passed on to the relevant web service (like Google Search) or sent back to your device. It's usually almost instantaneous if you have a decent Internet connection, but therein lies its one weakness: you do have to have that connection in order for it to work. The rudimentary offline system (in Android since Jelly Bean) relies on a relatively unsophisticated vocabulary and detection system that's slow and less powerful than the connected version. </p>
<p> Is that an Android phone tailgating you? No, that's just the operating system in your rear view mirror. Robin Labs, which previously made headlines with its Yahoo-optimized voice assistant, is at CES with Pioneer to show off a new smart rear view mirror called the Drive Agent Mirror. It runs Android with Robin's natural language voice recognition system built-in. Yes, it's probably as strange as it sounds. </p>
<p> The mirror is a little wider than average, but it looks otherwise normal when the display is off. When the embedded Android system is online, the left third of the mirror lights up with a semi-transparent display. </p>
<p> I've known my wife for five years now, and I still struggle to remember her phone number. The only numbers I know are those I can recall from before getting my first mobile phone, and since I have lost touch with nearly everyone from back then, that has largely been reduced down to immediate family members. For everyone else, there's a People app, and all I've had to do to dial them is start typing their name. Now I don't even have to make that much effort. If you join the Google Search field trial, you can find a contact's information simply by asking your phone. </p>
<p> Perhaps the most time-saving key on the Android keyboard is the microphone, but using it is more hassle than it's worth when certain words just refuse to be recognized. More often than not, these words are contact names. Luckily, there is a way to trick your phone into recognizing even the most tongue-twisting of names. If you're tired of your phone turning "Demonte Jones" into "Demon's bones," just teach it to recognize the latter as the former. Granted, this might be a problem when you're texting a friend the location of a secret item in your favorite MMORPG. </p>
<p> The instructions are pretty straightforward: </p>
<p> Open up the People app and find your desired contact. </p>
<p> Here at Android Police, we love Google Now (and all the associated voice actions), but the natural language could use a bit of sprucing up. If you'd like to try an alternative voice assistant, Indigo may grab your attention on this front. The pitch here is that the app remembers your conversations and can sync those inquiries across devices. </p>
<p> If you ask a question like, "Where can I find Indian food around here?" you'll get a list of results. Tap on the one you're most interested in. You can then follow that up with "How can I get there?" </p>
<p> We non-Jelly Bean plebeians have been envious of those with access to Android 4.1 for some time now, and a recent video from JLishere provides yet another reason to be jealous. The video, a demo of the much-anticipated Google Now, shows off just how accurate JB's voice recognition can be - in fact, it was able to pick up on the subtle differences between words like 'Worcester' and 'Wooster.' It also exemplifies the impressive number of commands Now (in cooperation with the Knowledge Graph) can register - from "call the Drake Hotel" to "do a barrel roll." </p>
<p> Enough balderdash, though - watch the 47-question demo for yourself: </p>
<p> Update: 20 more questions: </p>
<p> One last note: as JLishere notes in the video description, the demo was performed on an early build of Jelly Bean - this, in other words, should be considered a beta feature that will only get better with time. </p>
<p> Update: For anyone who can't install this because of geographical limitations, here is the apk for manual installation -- make sure to drop your results in the comments. Enjoy! Thanks, Nick! </p>
<p> Earlier today, popular voice recognition software corporation Nuance launched Dragon Go! by Nuance on the Android Market, bringing voice recognition that "just works" to the Android platform. Dragon Go! answers the users' queries by pulling data from a variety of sources, including Spotify, Wolfram|Alpha, Yelp, YouTube, AccuWeather, Ask.com, Dictionary.com, ESPN, Facebook, Fandango, Last.fm, LiveNation, Milo.com, OpenTable, Pandora, Rotten Tomatoes, Twitter, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, Bing, and hundreds of others. Additionally, Dragon Go's "Dragon Carousel" software provides users with complementary results to compare information across the most relevant sites for their query. </p>
<p> The winners have been selected and contacted via email. </p>
<p> Enjoy your Vlingo licenses and look out for future AndroidPolice contests! </p>
<p> Living in Houston, you encounter some pretty horrendous traffic. Out of the 45 minutes I spend commuting(one way), about 20 are probably spent at a red light. </p>
<p> With all of that downtime it’s pretty tempting to reach over and check your latest email, or, if you’re like me, compulsively check the market for updates, but every time you do so, you’re risking injuring yourself, and those around you. We all know it’s dangerous to use the cell phone while driving, but how many of us actually heed those warnings? </p>

<p> voice recordings </p>
<p> The world is slowly waking up from a full trust in digital companies deep somber and realizing that privacy and security do matter a lot. Google, Amazon, Facebook, and other behemoths have started changing the way they do things, putting more control in the hands of users, especially when it comes to which of their data is stored and where it's used. Amazon is following along that path today by introducing a way for you to quickly delete all your Alexa voice recordings from the day. </p>
<p> Google's speech recognition technology is insanely good - perhaps the best in the industry. But did you know Google stores all your voice searches? Every time you say "Ok Google" or "Hey Google," a snippet of audio containing the command is sent to the company's servers, where it is deciphered. These audio snippets are stored indefinitely (to improve accuracy), unless you delete them and opt out of future collection. </p>

<p> voice search </p>
<p> Shortly after starting to test an all-in-one record-and-publish function in the YouTube app, its developers have added another experiment that'll be useful for those of us who'd rather only watch videos. They're working on a button that lets you switch voice search languages right on the input screen. If you're multilingual and like using voice search, this will finally make it possible to search for videos that aren't available in the language you've set up in your YouTube app settings. </p>
<p> Earlier this week, YouTube introduced several new features to its app with the hopes of making it more accessible and easier to use. The most noteworthy addition was that viewers can now use voice search when casting the YouTube app to their smart TV. </p>
<p> Google is no stranger to making unannounced changes to apps and services, and sometimes the changes don't even show up for all users or devices. At least some Android users have noticed an alteration to the Google Search widget today. The microphone icon is gone, replaced with Discover and Lens. </p>
<p> To me, the whole idea of using voice search when I can just as easily type the exact query I want isn't appealing, but perhaps I should start changing my perception. Google's voice recognition algorithms are getting better and smarter, and one of the areas where you can notice this improvement is YouTube. Even more appealing now is the fact that YouTube immediately starts playing a video when you do a voice search. </p>
<p> Voice is quickly becoming a preferred method of search for many mobile users, and Google is responding by pushing voice features to as many of its platforms and services as it can. The latest example is voice search on Google.com for mobile web. The tech giant began rolling out the new feature this past week, but it's only available to Android users so far. </p>
<p> The speech input interface that is seen in apps like YouTube and the Play Store hasn't been updated for some time. If I'm remembering correctly, the last time it was revised was when the new Google logo replaced the old one, but it had remained largely the same for years before that as well. The company is now testing a Material-based UI that is a much better match for Android's current aesthetic. </p>
<p> We've been hearing that Spotify is aiming to produce its own hardware for a few weeks now, and this latest news substantiates those rumors. A native voice search is being tested in the iOS app, pointing towards future integration with a Spotify-built smart speaker. </p>
<p> Speech recognition is one of the most powerful aspects of many Google products, particularly in the Google app where Voice Search relies on being able to understand what we're saying. The same is true of Gboard, which is capable of typing up entire messages based on what you dictate to it. We may take it for granted somewhat these days, but it truly is a marvel. Now, this feature can be enjoyed by many more around the globe as Google has added support for 30 further languages. </p>
<p> Many of us were happy to see the recent addition of a keyboard input method in Assistant and the setting to choose it as a preferred method. After all, many of us don't like to shout at our phones all the time because we either need some privacy, we're often in public, or we may simply not feel comfortable talking to an inanimate object. </p>
<p> But what if the keyboard is your preferred input method and there's that one time where you would rather use voice instead? Maybe your hands are wet or dirty, maybe you're carrying something with your other hand and you can't easily type your request with just one, or I don't know... </p>
<p> To say that Waze is popular would be an understatement. The community-based traffic and navigation app has fans the world over, so when the developers add any new features, plenty are bound to notice. There's a new version out and it has a few additions, so let's take a look. </p>

<p> voice-to-text </p>
<p> Ever since the controversy arose surrounding Google training its voice recognition technology using human contractors, barely a week goes by without another company admitting to the same. While the practice doesn't come as a surprise to many familiar with the underlying technology, no company thought of clearly stating what they were doing, which is not a good idea considering rising privacy awareness among customers and regulators. Bloomberg found out that the same is true for Facebook Messenger, affecting users who turned on voice-to-text for audio messages. </p>
<p> We know, we know - you're tired of hearing about Siri and its respective knockoffs. But, we assure you, this one is different. Very different. In fact, it's beyond anything we've ever seen before. </p>
<p> The app is called Utter! and while it isn't yet available for download, it's already doing things that we could previously only imagine. Instead of just giving you a generic answer such as Siri and the like, it actually utilizes the apps that you already have installed. Want a add a calendar appointment? Tell Utter, and it'll take care of it. Get travel details, find out the weather, and launch applications - all child's play for Utter, and all done using native applications instead of just simple searches. </p>
<p> Nuance, the company behind Dragon Dictation, bought out Swype almost three months ago, but the results of the deal haven't really been exposed since. No longer -- Swype has just been updated with a "Dragon Flame" key that, when pressed, initiates a voice-to-text system provided by none other than Dragon Dictation. In its current form, it features support for French, Italian, German, and English, with Swype representatives claiming more languages are on the way in 2012. </p>
<p> Additionally, Swype's language modeling algorithm has been improved. What's that mean? In the company's words, this will "increase the accuracy of the suggestions we offer (such as knowing that you mean 'mosh pit' instead of 'mosh pot')." </p>

<p> voice typing </p>
<p> Gboard users are being fed some new features that run the gamut from big to small. The biggest out of them is that some Pixel owners are now seeing a new Google Assistant-powered voice typing UI. </p>
<p> To me, the whole idea of using voice search when I can just as easily type the exact query I want isn't appealing, but perhaps I should start changing my perception. Google's voice recognition algorithms are getting better and smarter, and one of the areas where you can notice this improvement is YouTube. Even more appealing now is the fact that YouTube immediately starts playing a video when you do a voice search. </p>
<p> The latest update to the Gboard app is now out, but it doesn't appear to be adding any features in this update, or at least not yet. A teardown points to some enhancements to some features we've either seen in the past or expect to go live in the near future, including tweaks to the Clipboard Manager, an option to delete search history, follow-ups related to voice typing, and of course, a ton of new languages and localized keyboards. </p>
<p> The speech input interface that is seen in apps like YouTube and the Play Store hasn't been updated for some time. If I'm remembering correctly, the last time it was revised was when the new Google logo replaced the old one, but it had remained largely the same for years before that as well. The company is now testing a Material-based UI that is a much better match for Android's current aesthetic. </p>
<p> Google added voice typing to Docs last year, but it was fairly limited. Today, Google is rolling out more features to voice typing in Docs. You now have control over formatting like text selection, punctuation, and copy / paste. While this is not strictly Android, it's pretty close and we think it's cool. </p>
<p> Google has found ways of letting us send text messages, perform search queries, and launch apps using our voice. Some of this functionality has made its way over to the desktop, such as asking Google questions. Starting now, if you open a tab to Google Docs, you can also write out documents. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/voip/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549329" filename="voip">
<p> voip </p>
<p> Whether you run a business from your personal Android device or work for a company that supplies a phone, it's important to always have access to your clients and customers whenever they need you most. Especially for younger businesses, missing a call or having a conversation interrupted by a shoddy signal could spell disaster for your brand's reputation. To help you manage your business communications from the convenience of your smartphone, Zadarma offers an intuitive VoIP telecom service backed by 12 years of evolution and proven success. </p>
<p> Google took a long, long break from Google Voice a while back. After letting the app fall into disrepair, Google expressed a renewed commitment to Voice in 2017. It has since announced a handful of feature updates, including VoIP calling in 2018. However, that feature never actually rolled out to everyone. Google's Scott Johnston says it's almost time, though. </p>
<p> It's always been hard to explain what Google Voice is because it feels like a VoIP service, but it's not. Google Voice has operated as a phonecall relay system all these years, forwarding your calls through another number. Earlier this year, Google started beta testing Wi-Fi calls in Google Voice, and it looks like the feature is rolling out to more users. </p>
<p> For mobile users juggling a bunch of different devices, Google Voice can be something of a godsend. Not only does it let you share a single point of contact through which people can reach you no matter which phone or tablet you're carrying at the moment, but it does so without requiring the party on the other end to install a specific app — everything travels over regular voice calls and text messages. </p>
<p> Good things are happening with Google Voice. While the app normally stays fairly quiet, the last few months have shown a lot of positive attention is going into the service. The surface-level changes in this update aren't too major, but a teardown shows that users will soon get a vastly improved voicemail system that features on-device recording and support for multiple messages. </p>
<p> Google has been dabbling in the realm of Internet-based calling for years. First it was Gmail, then Hangouts got in on the action. While there were ways (and even third-party products) to use the Google Voice service for VoIP, it was probably the least enjoyable calling experience we've seen that didn't involve MacGyver-style shorting of exposed wires to dial a number. Now an update to the Google Voice app reveals that it's finally going to make its VoIP capabilities an official feature, and it'll be usable directly from your phone without any hacky workarounds. </p>
<p> If you're not a Sprint customer who's in-tune with all the carrier's quirks and features, you probably haven't heard of Calling PLUS. After all, only three phones currently support it - that is, until now. The LG G6 has become the fourth Sprint phone to support Calling PLUS with this latest update. </p>
<p> Until recently, changing the number associated with your Viber account would mean losing your chat history. That would be very frustrating for heavy users with lots of conversations. Since the v.7.3 update, released earlier this month, it's been possible to back up up your data and take it with you when changing numbers. </p>
<p> Up to now, the most annoying part of using Uber is when a passenger and driver can't find each other and need to get in touch. Or maybe you want to let your driver know a specific detail about your location ahead of their arrival. There exists the option to use each other's phone numbers for a text or call, but this will come up as an unknown number for either recipient and could go unanswered. The obvious solution to this problem has finally arrived, as Uber has developed an in-app messaging service. </p>
<p> Late yesterday IFTTT saw a huge update. There are more than 30 new services tied to the automation tool via the new Data Access Project, including a ton of government and travel data sources. There is even a new Google Photos service that interfaces with the platform, as well as a VoIP feature for applets that use the phone service. Now you can set up IFTTT alerts on subjects like the economy and public transit, as well as upload images to Google Photos. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/volantis/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17551520" filename="volantis">
<p> Volantis </p>
<p> Update: Apparently Google is doing something different with the Nexus 9's binary release: there isn't one. According to Bill Yi, a regular Google poster, the necessary proprietary drivers are actually included on a separate partition of the Volantis software image. That would explain why the LRX21L release is almost twice as big as the last KitKat images for previous devices. </p>
<p> Proprietary Binaries are also available for Fugu. No proprietary binaries are needed for Volantis. </p>
<p> The device is generally as we expected. It's an HTC-made Nexus tablet with a 4:3 aspect ratio and a 9" display (give or take). </p>
<p> Nexus season is in full swing, and as rumors and leaks continue to pile up around Motorola's Nexus 6 (Shamu), we've been wondering when more news might emerge about Volantis (or Flounder, or T1, take your pick) - HTC's 9" Nexus tablet that we first learned of back in spring. </p>
<p> As Blog of Mobile reports, it looks like the Nexus 9 has passed through the FCC for certification, with the relevant documents becoming available just yesterday. </p>
<p> We recently posted an exclusive look at technical drawings for a Bluetooth keyboard cover destined for HTC's upcoming Nexus 9 (Volantis) tablet. At the time all we had to go on were drawings accompanying the information provided to us (and my own renders), but VR-Zone caught some photos of the keyboard case as it passed through NCC certification. </p>
<p> We can confirm that the model number for the keyboard in these photos (UG0B) matches the model number in the materials provided to us for our initial coverage, so - while the device pictured may still be in testing - we can say with confidence that this is the same keyboard case. </p>
<p> Earlier last month, we posted an exclusive story about Google's explorations into a product called "Workshop," which would allow users to customize snap-on cases and live wallpapers for their Nexus phones. The effort would be a major step-up in what has historically been an inconsistent lineup of accessories for Google's devices. </p>
<p> From information made available to us, it appears Google plans to continue upping the offerings when HTC's nine-inch Nexus tablet becomes official. </p>
<p> Yesterday, we dropped a leaked image and render of Volantis, an alleged upcoming Nexus tablet built by HTC. We also dropped specification info and pricing - and that's really what this weekend's poll is about. </p>
<p> This new Nexus tablet isn't messing around - it will sport an NVIDIA Tegra K1 64-bit processor utilizing the company's proprietary Denver CPU core, a very powerful desktop-architecture GPU, 2GB of RAM, an 8.9" display with 2048x1440 resolution (that's 4:3 aspect ratio), aluminum construction, and will likely launch with one of the biggest Android releases (the "L" release) to date. </p>
<p> We don't have news about whether a Nexus phone exists, but we do have information related to HTC's Volantis (or Flounder), an 8.9" Nexus tablet. The information provided to us indicates possible specs, features, and pricing, as well as an early look at the form factor, though the images we have don't appear to be final renderings of the device. </p>
<p> Just minutes ago we posted about the discovery of an Android 4.4.3 changelog in AOSP and we've already found some interesting information. Among the individual project repositories, there are a few dedicated to Google-supported devices, mostly those in the Nexus family. In particular, we came across new references to an HTC device codenamed "Flounder," and another device belonging to Google with the name "Molly." This is the first time that these names have appeared in AOSP. </p>

<p> Every few weeks for so, Google updates the Android Auto website with a list of newly-supported cars. This time around, though, there are far more cars (and head units) than usual from a wide variety of brands that have just had AA support added. </p>
<p> In what many may see as a slightly strange move, the Financial Services division of the Volkswagen Group has purchased the leading way to pay for car parking, PayByPhone. The amount the Group will pay, or any other terms of the deal, has not revealed. </p>
<p> PayByPhone has over 12.5 million registered users worldwide, processing more than $250 million in parking payments in 2016 alone. When you consider that a parking fare is nothing more than a few dollars, that's quite a lot of individual payments. The company says that the purchase will allow it to "explore new ways to expand our mobile payments technology" and it is "[looking] forward to accelerating our consumer parking and payments agenda made possible by this deal". </p>
<p> The Volkswagen Jetta is, admittedly, the occasional butt of car enthusiast jokes. Long considered a slightly snobby small economy sedan because of its comparatively high price of entry and less-than-great reliability reviews, the car didn't sell amazingly well here in the states for quite some time. Five years ago, VW tried to turn that sales situation around, completely redesigning the Jetta and drastically reducing the cost of many of its constituent parts - the result was the Mk.VI Jetta, and sales did go up quite noticeably. </p>
<p> But the car was compromised, and reviewers generally weren’t fans. Cost-cuts included things like fitting an unrefined rear beam-axle suspension system on most models, ditching optional leather trims, saddling the base car with a gutless 2.0-liter naturally-aspirated 4-cylinder engine, and conducting most of the design and assembly in Mexico instead of Germany. </p>
<p> At an event in California earlier today, Volkswagen officially announced that upcoming 2016 VW models will be Android Auto-ready. Which models? For now, what we know is this: most model year 2016 VWs at "SE" trim and above will likely pack the generation two MIB infotainment system, which has Android Auto (and Apple CarPlay). There are 6.5" and 8" versions of MIB 2, but both offer the same Auto experience. </p>
<p> Nokia, in their continuing withdrawal from the mobile phone and software industry, appears close to selling off their best remaining asset in that market: HERE Maps. According to a report by Bloomberg, Nokia will sell their mapping technology and know-how to Germany's three biggest automakers, BMW, Audi (owned by Volkswagen), and Mercedes-Benz. Though they typically compete against one another, each shares common concerns about Google's market position and privacy policies. </p>
<p> The report estimates the asking price of HERE to be nearing $4 billion USD, though the final offer may be closer to $2.5 billion. While that sounds like a big number, HERE is a product of Nokia's acquisition of NAVTEQ for $8.1 billion in 2008. </p>
<p> Certain 2015 Volkswagen cars with come equipped with Android Auto and CarPlay (Apple) support starting later this year. The option will be available in any models that come with MiB II, the second generation of the manufacturer's "modular infotainment platform," though the Golf is the only vehicle explicitly mentioned in the announcement. MirrorLink support will also come included. </p>

<p> When Android 10 was released, a handful of features spotted in the earlier betas weren't present. According to a bit of digging the by the folks at XDA Developers, some of those features including the Tasker-like "Rules" and built-in screen recorder may still be planned, as they were spotted on videos posted to a Google Photos page linked to by an internal version of the Google Camera app, which has since been taken down. </p>
<p> Android's L release is going to bring about a ton of new changes and improvements, and they took time to talk about a few of the most important today. That includes a new default runtime, improved graphics, and improved battery life. </p>
<p> ART is now the default runtime </p>
<p> We actually saw this coming, but it's now confirmed. ART brings twice the performance over the current runtime, Dalvik. It has been available as a preview for KitKat, but is becoming the default (and from what I can tell, only) runtime in the L release. It's more memory efficient, more flexible, and faster. Even older devices will benefit from this. </p>

<p> voltage </p>
<p> Every phone manufacturer these days touts the charging capabilities of its high-end devices. Most of us are probably familiar with Qualcomm's various Quick Charge specifications, which it licenses to companies like Motorola and Samsung, but there are also other solutions out there. USB Power Delivery is an open standard that's growing more ubiquitous with each day, and OnePlus' Dash Charge breaks records—even as it breaks the USB-C spec. </p>
<p> With all these different ways to charge your phone, how can you actually measure what rate it's charging at? </p>
<p> I admit that we're all pretty nerdy here at AP and we obsess over things that most people don't even consider. But we do it for all of you. One thing that some of us, especially Artem, want to know is how fast a particular charger/cable combination charges. Power meters were designed just for people like us, but I am here to show you what the folks at Satechi have cooked up. </p>
<p> To any hardcore modder, overclocking (or underclocking) your CPU is one of the best ways to get the most from your device. While some popular ROMs now have the ability to control your CPU baked in, many don't - and in the earlier days, virtually none did. Enter SetCPU - the de facto standard. </p>
<p> The app has long been a favorite, picking up 100,000-500,000 downloads at $1.99 and over 17,000 ratings for an average of 4.5 stars. There's good reason for that: it offers a huge range of ways to tweak your CPU, including profiles, clock speed, voltage settings, and more. </p>

<p> volume </p>
<p> Android gives you separate volume control for media, notifications, and alarms, but Google appears to be working on adding a fourth slider to the mix. The AOSP Android 11 code suggests that the company is at least considering to add dedicated volume control for voice assistants, including but not limited to Google Assistant. </p>
<p> We've already covered well over 200 changes in the public betas of Android Q, but many of those are smaller tweaks that aren't quite important enough to be covered in dedicated posts. Following our coverage of Beta 1, 2, and 3, here are all the minor changes in Android Q Beta 4. </p>
<p> One annoying quirk with 2-in-1 Chromebooks (and Chrome OS tablets) has been with how volume controls work. The volume up/down buttons always stay in the same position, even if you flip the device around — for example, when I used to have my Asus C302 in tablet mode, pressing where the volume up button should be actually turned the sound level down. Thankfully, this papercut is close to going away forever. </p>
<p> Less than a month after the first one, Android Q Beta 2 has landed with a decent amount of changes in tow. Among those changes is a convenient new volume pop-up to control all of the different volumes without having to enter the settings app. </p>
<p> The recently-released Android P developer preview 4 is meant to be one of the last two release candidates—according to Google's initial released timeline—and in general that means polishing up existing features more than introducing a lot of new ones. Even so, a few new tweaks are present in this latest build, like a new slider for controlling call volume in Settings -> Sound. </p>
<p> Since Android P's inception, we've written over 100 feature spotlight posts about various new changes Google has added in. Even in its third developer preview, lots of changes are still being added, but some are so minor they don't really warrant their own posts. However, if you like nitpicking every little thing like many of us, this might be the post for you. </p>
<p> Ten days have passed since we started digging into the Android P developer preview release, and while we've enjoyed many of the new changes and shared with you our five favorites, there are other modifications that left us scratching our heads a little. This is a developer preview, so things are expected to be buggy, some features could be experimental and could change with the next releases, but there are others that might be here to stay. </p>
<p> We've scoured our long, long list of Android P posts looking for those that we either don't like or that many of you voiced disapproval for. </p>
<p> Android's separate volumes for media, calls, and alarms can be great in some situations and terrible in others. I'm sure many of you have tried to preemptively turn down the volume as a YouTube video is loading, only to set your phone to vibrate and have the video play at full volume anyways. Nine years after Android was first released, this problem has finally been solved. </p>

<p> The Text-to-speech app doesn't see many major updates throughout the year, but when it does, there's often something interesting to see. Version 3.10 began rolling out yesterday and it comes bearing a pair of new settings to intelligently alter volume based on existing audio playback and to control the intonation of synthesized voices. As always, we've got a link below to grab the latest apk if you aren't among the first to get it straight from Google. </p>
<p> Most of the app updates this week were relatively quiet, with the notable exception of Play Music with its new ad-supported radio feature. That doesn't have to mean some of the updates don't have something new to offer. The Google app (formerly "Search") was bumped up to v4.8 yesterday, but it doesn't seem to have any noticeable changes right now. However, a look under the hood reveals some pretty interesting features on the horizon. </p>
<p> Disclaimer: Teardowns are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete evidence. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. There is always a chance that details may change or plans may be cancelled prior to the launch of a new feature discovered in a teardown. </p>
<p> Late yesterday, Google began rolling out an update to the Android Wear companion app. Despite a sudden growth of over 2 MB in size, the app only seemed to change the text of a warning, and there were no visible changes on our watches. We knew there had to be something great hidden under the covers, and we were right. The companion app certainly has some interesting changes of its own, but it also acts as the delivery mechanism for a Wear-customized version of Google Play services, and there's a bit to talk about in there, too. </p>
<p> Disclaimer: No matter the confidence level, there's always a chance product updates, features, and some or all details will be changed or cancelled altogether. </p>

<p> volume control </p>
<p> One of the things that first struck me about MX Player, when I tried it out many years ago, was its swiping gestures on each side of the screen. Instead of looking for physical volume buttons or pausing the video to find the brightness controls on my phone, a simple swipe would adjust those without skipping a second. These same gestures are now available in Android's built-in video player. </p>
<p> Choosing and setting up widgets is one of the joys of using Android over iOS, so you shouldn't neglect them — and you've got a broader range of top-quality widgets to choose from than you might have realized. We've picked out some of our favorites, and they all bring something genuinely useful and functional to your home screen. </p>
<p> Logitech's Harmony universal remotes are powerful devices that let you throw away the different remotes you have for your entire entertainment center and replace them with just one. However, if you own Sonos speakers, you may have noticed an issue over the past few weeks: your Harmony remote suddenly seems unable to properly control your speaker. </p>
<p> The Google Clock app received an update earlier today to version 4.4, bringing with it an assortment of odd little changes. There are some new features, a couple of adjustments to text and animations. However, the one thing that may deserve the most attention is a fairly significant size decrease. As always, you can grab the apk at the bottom of the post if it's not yet available to you through the Play Store. </p>
<p> The significance of SoundHUD becomes apparent only when you pay ridiculously close attention to Android news. As I'm sure most of you do, this will all fit together nicely. SoundHUD picks up where the now-defunct Noyze left off to make it easier to control the volume on your device. It also adds a simple way to get silent mode (more or less) back on Lollipop. </p>

<p> volume rocker </p>
<p> We already knew that the Verizon version of the OnePlus 8 was unique in having mmWave support, when the unlocked version of the phone doesn't, but it turns out that's not the only hardware difference. The Verizon OnePlus 8 also puts its volume rocker in a slightly lower position, apparently to make room for a mmWave antenna. That means you'll need to make sure cases you buy are made specifically for the Verizon version of the phone. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S8 has a bigger focus on audio than any previous Samsung flagships. The speaker gets surprisingly loud, nice AKG earphones come in the box, and the onboard Bluetooth 5.0 enables features such as Dual Audio (the ability to stream to two Bluetooth devices simultaneously). In keeping with this theme, Samsung has just published a SoundAssistant app on the Play Store for Samsung devices running Android 7.0 Nougat+. It's pretty cool. </p>

<p> vote </p>
<p> Searches for "how to vote" in the US are reportedly higher than they've ever been. If you're looking for your closest early voting location, where to drop your mail-in ballot, or just where to go on election day, Google can help. Today, it's launching new Search and Maps features to help you find the voting answers you're looking for. </p>
<p> Last week was pretty busy with some big app updates and even bigger product announcements. One update that slipped through the cracks was Allo v6. There aren't any obvious new features, but there's plenty for a teardown. Some of the upcoming features will include a chat bot to enable voting among members of a group chat, Android Auto support, animated emoji, and some new drawing tools. </p>
<p> The midterm elections are fast approaching in the United States, and you know what that means: horrible commercials interrupting all of your football games. But it also means that citizens should sincerely evaluate candidates for local and national posts and make informed decisions while performing their civic duty. And if you'd like to do that without taking a few hours off of work in November, you can register to vote early in most states. </p>
<p> Google knows this, and appears to be inserting the relevant information into Google Now for people in certain areas. </p>
<p> It's finally here. You've seen it, gawked at it, drooled over it, and quite possibly done unspeakable things in your desire to have it. So, what do you think of the Galaxy S III - as good as promised, or "meh"-fest? </p>
<p> If you need some numbers to decide your vote, here are a few specifications to look over: </p>
<p> 1GB RAM </p>
<p> 16/32GB storage, 64GB version "available soon" </p>
<p> microSD Card slot </p>
<p> Smart stay: keeps the screen awake while you're looking at the display </p>
<p> S-Voice: advanced voice recognition, "like a good friend who listens attentively" -- definitely a strong competitor to Siri </p>
<p> Floating videos: lets you resize videos and move them around on the display whilst they float atop other windows. </p>
<p> You made your nominations, and you voted. Now we have a winner. The Andy for Best Non-Nexus Android Phone of 2011 goes to... </p>
<p> Best Non-Nexus Android Phone Of 2011: Readers' Choice </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S II. </p>
<p> This really comes as no surprise. The Samsung Galaxy S II is still one of the most powerful handsets on the market, and with an Ice Cream Sandwich update inbound sometime in the coming year, it's only going to get better. The jaw-dropping SAMOLED Plus display and wickedly fast Exynos dual-core processor made quite an impression when we reviewed the Sprint-ified version, the Epic 4G Touch. </p>
<p> You made your nominations, and we've selected four of the most popular titles named as "Best New Android Game of 2011" for you to vote on. You voted. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner. </p>
<p> Best New Android Game Of 2011: Reader's Choice </p>
<p> And the Andy goes to.... Shadowgun - by a razor thin 14 votes. </p>
<p> While it was by the narrowest of margins that Shadowgun won a plurality of the votes (32% - see below), it's not hard to see why - truly amazing graphics, great over the shoulder gameplay, and console-level polish made it clear from the day we first saw screenshots of this game that it was going to do big things. </p>
<p> Taking a break from our regular social giveaways, last week we announced a creative contest to see which one of our readers can come up with the most creative 404 Page Not Found page for the site and in exchange win a brand new T-Mobile G2x Tegra-powered phone from NVIDIA. </p>
<p> Throughout the contest, I found myself absolutely blown away by some of your submissions, finding it harder and harder to decide who presented the best design. Now that I've sorted all 140 or so entries and selected the 20 best ones, I'm going to let all of you help us decide instead. </p>
<p> It's that time of the week again folks - time to hit the polls. This week's question is one that'll allow you to express what you think an Android handset should let you do in terms of customization, modification, and other various tinkering (think rooting, custom ROMs, kernels, etc). Basically, we want to know how important it is for you, as a consumer, that your next phone be easy to customize. Or if that really isn't important at all. </p>
<p> Let us know in the comments what ROMs, rooted apps, and other goodies only available to the rooted/unlocked users among us that you just can't live without. </p>
<p> As you may (or may not) recall, we crowned the DROID Bionic the most exciting device in Verizon's LTE lineup after playing with it at CES, but it appears that the version we saw might not be the version that'll end up in retail stores. Over the past few days we've heard countless reports that the device has been delayed (or even cancelled), and now a Motorola spokeswoman has reached out to the Wall Street Journal with this nugget of information: </p>
<p> Based on compelling feedback since the show, we are incorporating several enhancements to make this an even better consumer experience. </p>
<p> HP's recently announced TouchPad is a genuinely exciting device - there's no question about that. In fact, with such features as a dual-core Qualcomm CPU and the fancy new "Tap to Share" technology, it might just be the most serious competition Honeycomb tablets will face in the first half of 2011, aside from a certain Apple product. </p>
<p> But is it enough to cause you, dear Android Police reader, to second-guess the XOOM or G-Slate? I know it isn't enough for me - and here's why. </p>
<p> Just look at the TouchPad - its design makes it clear that what HP has created is essentially the iPad's twin sister. </p>

<p> Regardless of what side of any particular issue you're on, political ads kind of suck — and on top of that, it's not even clear how effective they are. The brass at Facebook is acknowledging that fact, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a piece published recently in USA Today that users will soon be able to opt out of seeing them entirely. </p>
<p> It's been almost exactly one year since the 2018 Users' Choice Awards, and like clockwork, Google is asking its users again to place their votes in the 2019 Google Play Users' Choice Awards. There is now one more category (books) to vote on, and more choices in each category to choose from compared to last year. The four categories are apps, games, movies, and books. </p>
<p> Nevermind the Oscars or the Golden Globes, the accolades we really care about here at AP are the Best of Google Play Awards. It's time to dust off your dinner jacket and shine those shoes — the 2018 nominees for the User's Choice categories have been announced. As usual, there are three categories: Best App, Best Game, and Best Movie. </p>
<p> Things have been quiet for the Play Store for the last few months, but a pair of updates to v11.5 and v11.6 began rolling out with some interesting clues hidden under the hood. Two new features appear to be in the works. The first is a loyalty program called Play Points, which works a bit like rewards points on a credit card that can be used for in-app purchases and Google Play credit. The second feature is a new voting system where users can play a role in picking favorites. </p>
<p> Last week was pretty busy with some big app updates and even bigger product announcements. One update that slipped through the cracks was Allo v6. There aren't any obvious new features, but there's plenty for a teardown. Some of the upcoming features will include a chat bot to enable voting among members of a group chat, Android Auto support, animated emoji, and some new drawing tools. </p>
<p> Here's a mildly interesting story discovered by one member of the CyanogenMod Reddit board. Apparently the state congress of Indiana uses a custom setup to allow its state senators and representatives to submit votes. A Nexus 7 running the CyanogenMod custom ROM is permanently attached to each congressperson's desk, connected to the building's intranet system using a custom Ethernet adaptor (to avoid problems from an overcrowded Wi-Fi connection - there are 150 senators who vote at once), and hooked into SmartVote software from Propylon. </p>

<p> voucher </p>
<p> If the rollout of an updated Play Store yesterday with some tweaked interface elements and an order history page was exciting, just wait until you see what else was hidden inside the latest version. I don't think there's any point in teasing, this might be the one we've all been waiting for. The Play Store is finally going to enable a method to offer discounted purchases. There are still a lot of unknowns, but it's real, and it's probably coming very soon. </p>
<p> It always stings when you buy a device just before the price drops. If you happened to pick up a Nexus 7 directly from ASUS or Google, though, you may be in for some good news. Two separate partial refund systems are in place to compensate you. If you're in Europe and you purchased the slate directly from ASUS prior to October 29th, 2012, you can register for a €30 (or ₤25 for UK owners) voucher that's good for use in the company's online store. </p>
<p> In the world of digital music stores that aren't iTunes, Amazon is a crowd favorite. With DRM-free downloads of widely-compatible MP3s and a cloud storage player that isn't the worst in the world, it's hard to not enjoy the utility of Amazon's music service. If that's not enough, though, how about some free stuff? Amazon is currently offering $3 worth of free music to anyone who asks. As long as you ask before midnight (PST), that is. </p>
<p> Potential Kindle Fire owners, pay attention! Amazon's offering a free $30 voucher code towards the purchase of a Kindle Fire to anyone who asks right now. As a bonus, once you order your Kindle Fire, you'll receive $5 worth of Amazon Instant Video credit. Pretty sweet deal! </p>
<p> The current list price for the Kindle Fire is still $199, so this voucher will bring it down to the extremely palatable price point of $170. </p>
<p> Whether you're looking for a new Verizon Wireless device or some accessories, you may find that this Black Friday deal from LivingSocial is just what the doctor ordered. For 25 bucks, you get a $50 voucher to spend on said items, valid November 29th through December 31st of 2011. </p>
<p> A word of warning - you can only use it in VZW retail stores or through telesales, but not online or at authorized dealers. </p>

<p> Pretty much everything you do online these days routes through your home network: binging shows, scrolling through social media, sending confidential work documents. Everything. And unless you're using a secure VPN, any of these activities could be easily infiltrated and exploited by cyber criminals. Enter Surfshark, the lauded VPN service that promises to protect all of your devices for just $1.99 a month (83% off) for the next two years. </p>
<p> A major aspect of using VPN services for privacy or security is that you must trust your provider. If the service is actually willing to cooperate with spies or hackers, they could compromise all of your browsing activity. In this environment that requires trust, Private Internet Access is among the industry's most highly esteemed services. For just a few days, you can get 2 years of their fully functional subscription for only $60, a $20 savings over their regular pricing that already blew competitors out of the water. </p>
<p> Private Internet Access allows you to use servers in 20 different countries, not to mention multiple locations within the US, UK, and Canada. </p>

<p> Concerns about privacy online are only growing nowadays. You might be interested in avoiding the NSA, advertising agencies, your ISP, hackers, or whatever is going on at that free hotspot you just connected to. A popular and powerful method of doing this is using a VPN, which both changes your visible IP address (like a proxy) and encrypts all your web traffic to keep prying eyes away (unlike a proxy). </p>
<p> TigerVPN in conjunction with StackSocial is now offering a lifetime subscription to their "lite" VPN service for only $29, less than a one-year price for most competitors. </p>

<p> VPN Plus Server </p>
<p> I'm a fan of Synology. I've had their DS416Play DiskStation for a while (review coming) and I never fathomed the idea of having my own "server" but they made the process as simple and fast as possible so that even someone like me, with no background whatsoever in server management, could be up and running in a matter of minutes. </p>
<p> Beside their DiskStation lineup, Synology also makes a couple of routers and tries to simplify many a router setup process and hurdle with smart add-on packages. One example is the VPN Plus Server, which when installed on your router transforms it into a VPN server so users can connect to it as if they're on the same local network, and thus benefit from access privileges remotely and securely the same way they would if they were physically there. </p>

<p> VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks, are a popular way to stay safe online. When you connect to a VPN, all outgoing network traffic is funneled through an external server. Your internet service provider can't tell what sites you visit (only that you're using a VPN) or inject content into webpages. VPNs are also commonly used to bypass blocked websites and to stay safe on public Wi-Fi networks. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, using certain VPN providers can be just as dangerous as going without a VPN in the first place. Many popular providers will log connection details of users, which can then be sold to third parties. </p>
<p> Linode is a popular virtual private server provider with users scattered all over the world, and now many of them can monitor their Linodes from their Android devices. The mobile app that was previously only available on iOS has undergone a makeover, and today it's making its Android debut. </p>
<p> With Linode Manager, users can monitor their Linodes, NodeBalancers, and domain zones. Linodes are accessible via either SSH or Lish, and a dedicated page is present with graphs illustrating CPU and network performance. This app naturally won't replace a computer, but it's handy enough for a sysadmin to want it in their tool belt. </p>

<p> VR </p>
<p> You probably barely remember what Daydream is, or rather was, and no-one will blame you for that. Google launched its VR platform back in 2016 and even introduced its own View headset to the market, which it also updated about a year later. Apps became gradually available for the platform until many of them stopped being updated, or worse, entirely dropped support for Daydream. It was clear Google pretty much abandoned it, but it's now made it official with an announcement. </p>
<p> Virtual reality company Oculus used to have a tight partnership with Samsung, to the point where both company's devices shared the same software ecosystem. The Oculus Go was released in 2018 as a self-contained VR headset, with a Snapdragon 821 processor and full compatibility with games built for Samsung's Gear VR. Sadly, it's now time to say goodbye to the headset. </p>
<p> Virtual Reality may not be the hot topic it once was, a few years ago, but it has settled into a nice niche for gaming first and foremost, and media consumption to a more minor degree. If you're intrigued by VR and have been pining for one of those powerful headsets, you can spare your wallet and start small today with the Oculus Go, which is down to $150. </p>
<p> It has been three weeks since the last Chrome release, and right on schedule, Chrome 79 is now rolling out across desktop and mobile platforms. This isn't the largest update we've seen recently, but there are a few changes worth highlighting. Let's jump right in! </p>
<p> Long before Google introduced Daydream and subsequently left it dead in the water, the company created the Cardboard platform. You can use the carton headsets as an ultra-low-budget entry to VR to this day, and they're compatible with almost any regularly shaped phone on the market. Google has now open-sourced the underlying VR SDK which will allow interested developers to create their own VR experiences on Cardboard viewers and improve and enhance the project as they see fit. </p>
<p> Chrome 78 has rolled out to all platforms, which means it's time for Chrome 79 to hit the Beta Channel. This update is definitely smaller in scope than the last few releases, but there are still a few interesting additions — especially if you're interested in VR/AR. </p>
<p> The VR hype train has slowed down considerably over the last couple of years, but that doesn't stop companies invested in the technology from iterating on their products. The same is true for Facebook, which announced a number of significant improvements to its VR division during its annual Oculus event on Wednesday, making advanced virtual reality experiences more accessible at lower prices. Among a plethora of changes to the platform, you can now let the Oculus Quest track your hands without additional hardware and connect it to a computer via USB, allowing you to get some of the full Rift VR experience. </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Note10 was officially announced last week, and while it's jam-packed with almost everything most people could want in a smartphone, it also dropped a few features: the headphone jack is completely gone, and the microSD card slot isn't present on the smaller model. It has also become evident over the past few days that the Note10 doesn't support any mobile VR platform, marking an end to both Gear VR and Google Daydream. </p>
<p> If you want a virtual reality headset to kill some time with, but don't want to burden yourself with wires or a high price tag, the Oculus Go might be calling your name. It's currently available at its lowest price for both of its storage options at Amazon and Best Buy. </p>

<p> Way back at CES in January, Lenovo and Google announced they had partnered on two new virtual reality hardware products, but gave no indication as to a release date. But thanks to two listings at B&H Photo, the cat is out of the bag...and you can record the cat as it emerges from that bag in glorious 4K virtual reality starting on May 11. </p>
<p> Last summer, Google announced a new video format to simplify the creation of virtual reality content, VR180. Now at CES, they've partnered with Lenovo and Yi Technology to bring VR180 to consumer hardware in the form of a new Daydream headset and two VR cameras. </p>
<p> Today YouTube has announced a new video format to go along with all that VR the kids are using these days. It is called VR180, and it was created for YouTube in collaboration with Google's Daydream team. It works for both prerecorded and livestreamed content, and it's compatible with Google Cardboard, Daydream, and PSVR. </p>

<p> Remember that scene from every action movie ever, where the headstrong but academically challenged hero has to be walked through an on-the-job lesson in bomb defusal by the specialist on the other end of the radio/phone/hyperspace ansible connection? Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is basically that experience, set up for two players (the on-the-job hero and remote specialist), and designed to create the maximum amount of tension possible. It debuted on Steam last year, but now it's available on the Play Store for early Daydream VR users. </p>
<p> One of the core principles of video games is that they're aspirational: we beat the invincible bad guy and drive hovercraft race cars in lavish fantasy worlds because we can't ever do it in real life. Video games are now so amazing that they're intersecting with the real world in the form of VR, but our aspirations have softened a bit as we've gotten older - now some of those impossible dreams include "owning a really nice house." FOX Sports VR has embraced the death of the American dream by virtualizing that nice house and letting you watch football in it. </p>

<p> The product life cycle can be harsh — smash hits fly off the shelves and rarely get discounted, but other products, though they may be decent, don't catch on and are brutally discounted in fire sales. The 3D 180VR video-capturing Lenovo Mirage Camera is one such example — originally launched for $300 in 2018, it can now be had for just $100 at Best Buy and Amazon. </p>
<p> For a while, Ricoh wasn't too well-known in the consumer electronics space as it mostly sold B2B office IT services, but over the last few years it has changed that by releasing impressively-specced 360-degree cameras and effectively dominating that market. It released the Theta V camera in September last year, offering spherical 4K recording plus "surround-sound" audio in a surprisingly compact device. Back in January, Ricoh announced a partner program to develop plug-ins for the Theta V, and that project is now bearing fruit. </p>
<p> We didn't even know the ASUS 360° Camera existed, but apparently it was announced along with the ZenFone 4 in August. This little ball-shaped camera attaches via USB-C or MicroUSB to your phone and takes spherical images with its two 210° lenses. It can take 4K (4096x2048) photos and 2K (2048x1024) videos, and let you view them as immersive panoramas, asteroids or crystalballs (both a little reminiscent of Tiny Planet). </p>
<p> Now the ASUS 360° Camera has its own app on the Play Store so you can control the camera if you purchase it. It can take photos with multiple filters, videos, time-lapses, and stream live to "popular social media platforms." </p>
<p> 360-degree cameras are all the rage these days, and Ricoh's new Theta V has an impressive set of features that might just make it worth your attention. Not only is it able to capture content in 4K, but it can also record "surround-sound" audio, each of which can add an extra layer of realism and immersion to your content. The product was just announced ahead of IFA, and although it's currently set for a September release, it's already up for pre-order. </p>

<p> Daydream virtual reality games may not have a huge following, but that doesn't mean there aren't quite a few quality titles out there for those of you who enjoy dabbling in mobile VR entertainment. So I have taken it upon myself to compile what I think are the best games on the platform in this Daydream roundup here. There are a total 30 VR games in this list, and almost all of them are either free or paid upfront. This way you won't have to worry about any expensive hidden costs. So what are you waiting for, go ahead and dive on in. </p>
<p> About a month and a half ago Ubisoft announced that a Rabbids-themed game would be coming to Google Daydream in the Spring. Well, it looks like that day has arrived. The game is called Virtual Rabbids: The Big Plan and you can purchase it today for $5.99. </p>

<p> VR headset </p>
<p> Self-contained headsets that run Google's Daydream VR platform went on sale earlier this year, and Google has continued to improve them since. Chrome for Daydream became available in July, and now the company has revealed what's next for the platform. </p>
<p> The virtual reality game is getting interesting, but the displays on the current generation of headsets are still getting in the way of truly immersive experiences. To solve this, Google and LG Display teamed up to produce an ultra high-resolution OLED panel intended for the next generation of VR headsets. This display was first discussed back in March, but it's now been officially unveiled at the Display Week 2018 expo. </p>
<p> Augmented Reality and ARCore are the hottest games in town nowadays, but if you're still grappling with the idea of Virtual Reality to begin with or if you prefer to immerse yourself completely instead of superimposing something on top of your existing world, then there's a nice deal for you at Best Buy. </p>
<p> The retailer is offering the 2017 edition of the Daydream View headset for 50% off. This is the one that has the better materials, better lenses, and the matching colored controller. The discount brings the price down from $99 to a more palatable $49.95. All three colors are available - charcoal, fog, and coral - and shipping is free. </p>
<p> Google announced a new Daydream View VR headset alongside the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, but it's been a few weeks since then and you still haven't been able to pre-order or even purchase one - until now, that is. The Google Store is now offering up these new Daydream Views for $99.99 a pop. </p>
<p> Facebook-owned Oculus is one of the two giants in VR right now, alongside HTC with its Vive headset. While Oculus is still working on the much-anticipated cordless PC headset, it announced another product today - the standalone Oculus Go. </p>
<p> Google unveiled its Daydream View VR headset alongside the Pixel in October 2016. At $79, it was a good way to bring virtual reality to the masses, with its comfortable fit and included controller. At Verizon's current price of $39.99, a purchase is virtually (ha, see what I did there?) a no-brainer if you're in the market for a VR headset. </p>
<p> We've had the Daydream View VR headset here in the States for nearly half a year now, but the same can't be said for many other countries. However, Google has just announced that the Daydream View can now be purchased in India from major retailer Flipkart for 6499 rupees. </p>
<p> LG's 2016 flagship, the G5, is still a solid phone, even if it never quite reached the same heights as other headline devices of the time. While you may not be willing to pay through the nose for it, $299 is an attractive price given its specs, and that's made even better when B&H are willing to throw in an LG 360 VR headset for nothing. </p>
<p> The ZTE Axon 7 was announced in May of last year with plenty of hyperboles over its BMW Designworks-inspired look, renowned pianist Lang Lang endorsement, and Dolby Atmos surround sound. In reality, the phone was very good, bar its software as Ryan discovered in his review. But ZTE has been issuing updates to improve some of the shortcomings, like the signal reception and the weird notification bell. Today, another update will start rolling to the Axon 7, though this one is a lot more major. </p>
<p> This is Android Nougat we're talking about, and with it come a host of changes like multi-window support, customizable quick settings tiles, plenty of new emojis, and more. </p>

<p> Google is starting to really push WebVR, the in-browser virtual reality platform that Chrome recently started supporting. The company recently showed off 12 new WebVR experiments to showcase various different applications for the tech. Now, Google is launching something even more impressive, the experimental VR film Tabel. </p>
<p> Twas days before Christmas but Samsung's marketing team was still busy, creating new VR experiences that are sure to make you feel dizzy. </p>
<p> Their latest is quite a remarkable thing to behold, with a VR device pressed to your face you can watch Santa's magical journey unfold. </p>
<p> Google is making no small effort when it comes to lining up content for its new Daydream virtual reality platform, and that content isn't restricted to games and 360-degree video. Following in the footsteps of HBO and Hulu, Netflix now comes in VR flavor for those subscribers with a Pixel phone and a Daydream View headset. The app is live on the Play Store right now, though it's not compatible with non-Daydream systems - sorry, Gear VR owners. </p>
<p> So far the focus in the new wave of headset-based virtual reality content seems to be video games, simulations, 360-degree videos and the like, but as it turns out, conventional 2D video content is easy to adapt into an immersive (if not groundbreaking) experience. Google itself offers all the content on YouTube in Daydream flavor, and now HBO is following suit. The premium cable channel has published a Daydream-compatible version of its online component, HBO GO, in the Play Store as an unreleased app. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/08/03 11:00am PDTon Aug 3, 2020 and last updated 2020/08/10 7:25am PDTon Aug 10, 2020. </p>
<p> The Pixel 4a is hands down a winner, even when stacked up against the already great Pixel 3a from 2019. We gave Google's new budget phone a glowing review, and there are ample reasons why. But at $350, you may be wondering how it compared to the premium Pixel 4, a phone costing more than twice as much ($800). Is there really $450 more smartphone in Google's high-end Pixel? We really don't think so, even when you're just comparing spec tables. But when you get down to the raw experience, the comparison is even more favorable to the 4a: this isn't just a great phone for the money, it's a great phone, no asterisk necessary. </p>
<p> Smartphones have become more expensive across the board in recent years, and OnePlus hasn’t been immune to this upward trend. The company has also gradually added many of the features fans and critics have been calling for, such as IP ratings and wireless charging. So while the OnePlus 8 Pro is more expensive than anything that came before it, it also represents the best phone OnePlus has ever produced. The cheaper OnePlus 8 is a bit harder to judge since it misses out on a few key features, and the introduction of the Nord puts in an even more awkward position. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/21 8:30pm PDTon Apr 21, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/11 6:44pm PDTon Jun 11, 2020. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 8 Pro is by far the most expensive smartphone OnePlus has ever produced. At $900, it's within shouting range of "proper" flagships like the Galaxy S20 and iPhone 11 Pro. While it does come with the company's most impressive array of features ever, there's no doubt that fans of OnePlus have balked at the idea of a near-$1000 OnePlus smartphone — a phone from the company that debuted the original OnePlus One at just $300. Compared to even the outgoing 7T Pro, the 8 Pro comes with a big price hike, and that's what we're taking a closer look at in this article. </p>
<p> Anyone who's used Google search recently will know how many different cards that have been implemented as of late. Google is now taking this a step further by including automatically generated expandable tabs that elaborate on different aspects of searches with comparisons, such as "quartz vs granite." </p>
<p> A platform can never have too many zombies, and thanks to a new co-op survival game called Call of Mini, Android now has a few more. </p>
<p> The popular iOS game came to the Play Store yesterday, and allows players to work with each other and take down hoards of zombies with whatever weapons they can find. Machine gun, chainsaw, rocket launcher, anything goes. </p>
<p> As well as a co-op mode, the game also allows you to play against other people in VS mode, from which you can gain various rewards. As you play each mode on the game more, you can pick up some achievements that are on offer, adding to the re-play value of the game. </p>
<p> With the upcoming release of AT&T's HTC One X, many people are wondering how it compares to the international version, which packs NVIDIA's quad-core Tegra 3 instead of Qualcomm's dual-core Snapdragon S4. One user out in YouTubeLand happened to get their hands on both variants and decided to boot them up simultaneously, as well as run AnTuTu Benchmark to see how they compare head-to-head. </p>
<p> While I realize that benchmarks are definitely not a definitive answer to how well the device performs, they do give a rough idea of what the device is capable of. Plus, they're just fun. </p>
<p> Right out of the gate, it's pretty clear that the Tegra 3 phone is quicker on bootup. </p>
<p> Bomberman vs Zombies by Contlex Labs, which spent "24 weeks in the list of top 10 BlackBerry games," has come to Android, bringing endless zombies and explosions to the palm of your hand. </p>
<p> BvZ should look extremely familiar to fans of Bomberman, or those who remember the rendition we saw a few months ago for Android, but Contlex's creation offers clean, pleasing graphics which can be enjoyed on smartphones and tablets alike, and a somewhat unique gameplay dynamic. </p>
<p> Bomberman vs Zombies pits the player as the heroic Bomberman, who is charged with the mission of eliminating zombies from the planet before they "realize their dark plans" of taking over the Earth. </p>
<p> Intrigued by his skills, I clicked through to his Deviant Art profile and found a stunning collection of 3D renders of Android and Apple, fighting to the death. I felt that being buried somewhere in the depths of the Deviant Art abyss was no proper way for these pictures to exist - they needed to be seen. By us. Now. So, without further ado, here they are (and you bet we'll be asking RougeCrown to come do some work for us here at AP!): </p>
<p> Are you ready for some Plants vs. Zombies? We know you've been waiting for it (I certainly have). Just a little bit longer: Plants vs. Zombies will be available on the Amazon App Store starting late this month (presumably May 30 or 31) for the low, low price of free. The app will be free on its debut-day (May 30), then for 2 weeks will be exclusively available on the Amazon App Store, in a deal similar to that which Rovio had with Amazon upon the release of Angry Birds Rio. </p>
<p> PopCap games, the developer of Plants vs. Zombies, has also revealed that the developer's second most popular title, Chuzzle, will be hitting the Amazon App Store tomorrow. </p>
<p> Update: In response to the ZDNet article, it seems like Mueller may well have been incorrect about the "additional instances" of possible infringement he claims to have found. Exhibit J (linked as "6 pages of code") from Oracle's amended complaint is not addressed in the ZDNet article. We make no claims as to the validity of Oracle or Mueller's assertion; we are merely commenting on the situation. </p>
<p> Many people are confused about what it is Mueller is saying about copyrighted code, and it's an understandably complex topic, one I don't claim to fully comprehend. Those who offer evidence that "debunks" Mueller's additional files clearly know a lot more about code than I do. </p>

<p> Looks like Verizon's on a roll – two OTAs in the same day! Earlier today, it updated the support docs for the original Stratosphere with details of an upcoming incremental update, and now it looks like Jelly Bean is getting ready to hit the airwaves on its way to the LG Spectrum 2. </p>
<p> Aside from Jelly Bean goodies, the update also packs a few fixes and tweaks: </p>
<p> + Weather application and widget have been updated + NFC LG Tag+ help has been improved + Brightness option has been moved to notification panel for global access + Browser now loads Google account bookmarks + Improved readability for email conversation + Optimized Bluetooth® connect/disconnect and audio stream switching implementations + User can back up contacts when the SIM is swapped to a new device + Preloaded widgets including Social+, Today+, Finance, News and Power Control have been removed </p>
<p> Once Big Red updates its support docs, that usually means an OTA is imminent – this one should likely start heading out sometime this week. </p>

<p> LineageOS is the most popular custom ROM in existence, and the project prides itself on bringing newer versions of Android to unsupported devices. However, Lineage has been a bit slow to roll out a version based on Android 10 ⁠— the Pie-based ROM was already available by this time last year. Thankfully, the next major version of LineageOS seems to be just around the corner. </p>
<p> The LineageOS project is busy as always, adding support for more devices and implementing new features. The last time we covered the popular custom ROM, official builds for the OnePlus 6T and 7 Pro arrived, and there have been plenty of additions (or re-additions, in some cases) since then. </p>
<p> After months of anticipation, the popular LineageOS custom ROM finally released a version based on Android 9 Pie last month. The project has already updated 30 devices to Pie, but now a few more have been added. Also, two phones now have official Oreo builds. </p>

<p> Photo filters aren't as big a business as they used to be — the early 2010s were dark times — but photo editor VSCO still takes them very seriously. The company has filed suit against the makers of fellow photo editor PicsArt, alleging that several of its filters were reverse engineered from VSCO's. </p>
<p> VSCO might not be as popular (or ego-driven) as Instagram, but it's made a comfortable name for itself among photography circles. Rather than dig through piles of low-effort content rated by likes or votes, VSCO strips things down to the just the basics: photos, messages, and you. Now the app is making it a bit easier to find the types of photos you might like, too, with a novel Discover feature that is advertised as being able to match emotional and aesthetic content, all powered by VSCO's pretentiously named "Ava" AI. </p>
<p> It's like there's a recipe for image sharing social networks: 1) launch the service with some hook to make it special against the thousands of other competitors, 2) wait until there are enough users and add a messenger so people can talk to each other without ever leaving your app, 3) launch a Snapchat-like auto-destruct feature, 4) separate all three features into their own standalone apps. VSCO has graduated from step 1 to step 2. </p>
<p> Yup, VSCO is rolling out Messages, so you can talk to all those VSCOers out there and not feel alone in your VSCO world. It's described as "a new way to connect, share inspiration, and learn from other creators in the VSCO community," which sounds inspiring, but all it is is an easy way to share photos, journals, other profiles, and DSCOs (animated images) with others. </p>
<p> VSCO started as just a camera and photo editing app, but it's grown into a little hipster-y image sharing community. The company announced a visual redesign last week, and it has started rolling out slowly on Android. This update brings gestures to the interface, but not normal ones. No, these are bizarre and confusing gestures. </p>

<p> v-squared </p>
<p> The Saygus V-Squared smartphone, which debuted with an intriguing presentation at CES a year and a half ago and was still being changed and promised at MWC in February, still isn't available. Of course it isn't. It's coming any day now, it really is, right after Valve releases Half-Life 3, Apple makes a combination television-car, and Google brings Fiber to [insert your town here]. But Team Saygus is insistent that the development process continues, as evidenced by their latest tweet. </p>
<p> Saygus, the company that really will have an actual smartphone for sale any day now, they totally promise, has some more promises for you. A press release issued at Mobile World Congress lays out a series of improvements to the crowdfunded V-Squared phone, which should be easy to implement since the phone still isn't finished despite a first quarter manufacturing target. No less than four, count 'em, four new features have been introduced since... last year's Mobile World Congress. The fact that Saygus has missed multiple ship dates between now and then is conspicuously absent from the press release. </p>
<p> Those features are "waterproofing" (an interesting claim, since every other manufacturer has the sense to cover their asses with the term "water-resistant"), Android 6.0 software, dual-SIM card slots (a popular feature for unlocked and low-cost phones outside the US), and a USB Type-C port, a la that OnePlus 2. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/vu/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549173" filename="vu">
<p> Vu </p>
<p> Picture this: you're setting the screensaver on your Android TV to show pictures from your Google Photos account, but wait — the account selection page shows hundreds of unknown Google accounts, complete with profile pictures, all showing as linked accounts! This is exactly what happened to at least two Android TV users, on television sets from Vu and iFFalcon (a subsidiary of TCL). </p>
<p> LG's Vu series is a bit of an oddball thanks to its 4:3 aspect ratio, an idea that even Apple has abandoned on its phones. But the company seems intent on making it work for at least one more device, and so we get the LG Vu 3, shorn of Optimus branding like the flagship G2. And that's not the only thing that the Vu 3 has in common with the G2. </p>
<p> For one thing, the screen is also 5.2" diagonally, though of course it will be considerably wider and shorter thanks to that paper-style aspect ratio. It also has a considerably lower resolution at 1280x960, though that beats the previous members of the Vu family. </p>
<p> In a short press release sent out this evening, LG announced that it would be ditching the word (is it a word?) "Optimus" from its premium branding, opting to keep only the "G". </p>
<p> Furthermore, the release reaffirms the name of the company's upcoming flagship – G2. </p>
<p> The release contained one other tidbit – going forward, "LG's premium 4:3 display smartphones will be rebranded as simply 'Vu'." Yes, there will be at least one more Vu, if not more. </p>
<p> In case you were worried, LG assures customers that current smartphones will not be renamed as a result of the new branding effort. </p>
<p> The LG Optimus Vu, which launched on Verizon as the LG Intuition with Verizon earlier this month, was undoubtedly a strange device. Taking a page from Samsung's – ahem – note book, LG created the Vu for the phablet market, but decided to go with a somewhat awkward 4:3 aspect ratio, adding to the device's laundry list of quirks. </p>
<p> Well, the Korean manufacturer has just officially announced the Vu's successor – the Optimus Vu II. While it's a bit surprising to see a follow-up on the Vu this soon, the device looks alright on paper, and offers a few key spec improvements over its older counterpart. </p>
<p> Do you like phones that look like they've been through a taffy puller? Then the LG Intuition (aka Optimus Vu) may be the phablet for you. The Intuition for Verizon was announced last week, and is available officially starting today, though Wirefly has (as usual) managed to offer it at a slightly more reasonable price: just $150 on contract (new agreement or upgrade). That's $50 less than Verizon is selling it for, so there's no denying it's a deal. </p>
<p> There is denying, though, that you might actually, you know, want this phone. I suppose the one thing you could say about the Intution is that it's definitely a, uh, conversation starter. </p>
<p> After an exclusive stint in South Korea and Japan, LG's Optimus Vu is about to take various other parts of the world by storm. Select countries in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America will be seeing the Vu hit store shelves in September, and I imagine it's going to be pretty hard to miss. It's big. That's the joke. </p>
<p> LG's press release says the Vu "blurs the line" between phones and tablets for a "truly unique experience." I'll certainly buy that. Having used it in early prototype form myself back at MWC, I was baffled at how LG could go about justifying a smartphone like this, and I don't mean one with a 5" screen, but one that has a 4:3 display aspect ratio to go with it. </p>
<p> We're not exactly sure why, but LG has developed a gigantic new device called the Optimus Vu. And while the growing market for "mega-phones" seems to be getting more and more crowded every day, we have to say, LG's takes the cake for ridiculousness. The Vu's 5-inch display may not be absurdly large, but it is absurdly shaped. A 4:3 1024x768 (think CRT, Windows 98, etc.) display on the device makes it ridiculously wide, and also very oddly proportioned. I tend to think this is yet another device that will end up with 3rd-party app compatibility issues due to its unique resolution - something Kyocera Echo owners can probably... </p>
<p> MWC is still a few days away, and we're already starting to get some pretty great information on the devices that will shape the mobile electronics world in 2012. </p>
<p> Adding to the list of pre-MWC news items, the Italian blog Telefonino.net has posted a series of videos and photos, showcasing LG's complete Android lineup for 2012, from the LG Optimus 4X HD (which we mentioned yesterday) to the Optimus 3D MAX, to the Optimus LTE. Overall it's looking like LG is ready to introduce a bevy of impressively-spec'd handsets next week. It's worth mentioning ahead of time that the videos below are in Italian, but the hands-on demonstrations are worth watching anyway. </p>

<p> vudu </p>
<p> A Chromecast is an excellent way to make your TV smarter, but you can achieve ultimate comfort by controlling it using your voice. The best option to do so is to use Google Assistant, ideally through a smart speaker like the Home Mini. When bought separately, these devices cost about $75, but thanks to a Black Friday deal on Google's Smart TV Kit, you can snatch both devices for just $35 and get $10 of Vudu credit for free. </p>
<p> Last month, a problem with 4K playback surfaced on Nvidia's Shield TV. The issue affected VUDU and a few other unnamed services, and only occurred when using their native apps but not when casting to the Shield. Nvidia is now rolling out an update that's supposed to fix those problems. </p>
<p> If you have a Shield TV, you may have noticed that some apps have stopped playing content in 4K. That's annoying, but Nvidia has acknowledged the issue and said it's working on a solution. </p>
<p> If your wallet is already suffering from the major influx of pre-Black Friday deals, here's a welcome relief: YouTube now offers a bunch of free, ad-supported movies (at least in the US). Forget about your holiday spending woes and binge watch old school classics like Hackers, The Terminator, and a marathon's worth of Rocky films. </p>
<p> Vudu might not be the most popular video streaming service, but it's more useful on the SHIELD starting today. The app now has support for Google Assistant commands, and the SHIELD can output HDR video from Vudu. Of course, you'll need to own some HDR content on Vudu first. </p>
<p> Disney's Movies Anywhere has just launched a new service that allows you to store and access all your movies in one place. It has support from 5 major Hollywood studios, but more importantly also from 4 digital retailers where users already have movie libraries. Content from Amazon Video, Google Play, iTunes, and Vudu can be brought into the Movies Anywhere app, which is great for anyone with a fragmented collection spanning more than one of those services. Now, you'll only ever need to use one app again. </p>
<p> Movie and TV streaming app Vudu has become a popular option on Android in recent years. Its last big update added a nifty service that allows you to digitize your old discs for a small fee, and implementing parental controls was another important recent improvement. The latest update, to version 5.3.165.52141, brings more useful features that you might expect from a streaming app of its kind. </p>
<p> These days, you can't buy much for a dime. Back in the 19th century, you could get half a pie in New York City restaurants or two tall glasses of beer in Boston saloons with 10 cents, but times have changed - or have they? For a limited time, VUDU is offering up 30 movies in Digital HDX for just 10 cents per rental. </p>
<p> Vudu has offered a Disc-to-Digital service for a while for those who wanted to convert their physical DVD and Blu-Ray movie collection to digital. However, the service either required you to pop into a Walmart with all of your discs in hand or download the app on your computer and insert discs one by one to verify that you own them. Now, the option is available on mobile. </p>
<p> Through an update to the Vudu app, which doesn't seem to be live yet, Vudu users will be able to scan the barcode off their DVDs and Blu-Rays and let the app offer them the digital version in return. </p>
<p> Attention movie lovers: You are eligible for a free $5 credit on VUDU. The offer is good for new, or existing subscribers and can be applied toward any movie rental or purchase in VUDU's substantial library, including UHD titles. Yes, it is free movie money, no strings attached. </p>

<p> vue android </p>
<p> As Sony promised it would last week, it has released the PlayStation Vue app for Android today, featuring real-live cast support. The app is available on the Play Store now, or via APK Mirror right here. To use Vue, you'll have to be an existing Vue subscriber - the Android app doesn't have any kind of sign-up flow, so if you want to start a Vue trial, you'll need to do that through your PlayStation 3 or 4 console, or through the PS Vue webpage. You do not technically need a PlayStation to use Vue, and Sony offers a free 7-day trial, but you will need a supported Vue TV device (Amazon Fire TV and Roku, for example) to set up your initial profile - the Vue Mobile app does not support this feature. </p>
<p> Sony announced on the official US PlayStation blog this morning that its Vue live TV and video streaming service will launch on Android next week (the week of June 26th). The Vue app will work with Android smartphones and tablets with Android 4.4 or higher, and the app will support Casting - hallelujah. </p>
<p> PlayStation Vue essentially aims to be a "cable replacement" service of sorts, offering cable, premium, and specialty channels at a variety of pricing packages ranging from $29.99 up to $54.99 per month. PlayStation Vue also offers a number of a la carte channels. And now, with an incoming Android app, you'll be able to Vue anywhere - including on TVs without PlayStations (and with Cast). </p>

<p> vulkan </p>
<p> Vulkan is one of the most popular graphics APIs, with cross-platform support, low-level hardware access, and no royalties. Android has allowed games to use Vulkan for years, and Google's new Stadia platform requires all games to use the API. Khronos Group (not to be confused with the Klingon homeworld), the organization responsible for developing Vulkan, has announced a new version that promises to make games even more efficient. </p>
<p> Today's I/O news is slowing down, but that doesn't mean that cool or important stuff has dried up just yet. Last year, Google announced that it was bringing support for Vulkan 1.1 to Pie, but now the company has said that v1.1 will be a requirement for 64-bit Android devices running Q or higher. </p>
<p> Dolphin, the much-loved Nintendo GameCube and Wii emulator, has been making strides in Android support over the past few months. It returned to the Play Store in August 2018, and a few months later, rumble emulation and other improvements were added. The latest update to the Android port has even more improvements in store, like Wii remote emulation and fixes for Android 9 Pie. </p>
<p> Android 7.0 was the first release to support 'Vulkan,' the cross-platform low-level graphics API designed as the successor to OpenGL. There are a number of Android games and emulators that utilize Vulkan, including the Dolphin emulator, PPSSPP, and 3DMark. Version 1.1 of the API was released in March of this year, and Google has now confirmed that Android P will include it. </p>
<p> The code for Vulkan 1.1 was merged into AOSP last month, so this isn't much of a surprise, but it's nice to get confirmation. The new version adds extensions for multi-view, device groups, HLSL support, and more. </p>
<p> If you've been waiting for Nougat to miraculously appear on your SHIELD Tablet... keep waiting. This is not the update you're looking for, but it's an update nonetheless. There will be minor improvements to both SHIELD Tablets including, but not limited to, an updated Vulkan API and security patches. </p>
<p> The Dolphin emulator is an impressive feat of software engineering. Starting as a GameCube emulator, it later added compatibility for Wii games, due to the similar architecture. Over the years, Dolphin has gradually improved game compatibility; they recently reported that every single retail GameCube game boots. Even accessories like the Wii Remote and Wii Balance Board work perfectly, and experimental Android builds of Dolphin have been in development for years. </p>
<p> Dolphin on Android still isn't as usable as other console emulators, but the fault mostly lies with current Android hardware. Even the Nvidia Shield console, one of the most powerful Android devices on the market, can't run games at full speed. </p>
<p> Unity, if you're not familiar with game development, is a popular cross-platform game engine. Although Unity games can most often be found on PC and consoles, Android games utilizing the engine include Crossy Road, Monument Valley, Lara Croft: Relic Run, and more. Today Unity has announced the Vulkan Renderer Preview, finally allowing developers to use the Vulkan API with their games. </p>
<p> The Vulkan API (not to be confused with the Star Trek planet Vulcan) has been hyped to the moon and back in the gaming industry recently, and for good reason. Based on AMD's Mantle API, it is a new graphics API designed to be cross-platform (much like Unity) and have a low overhead. </p>
<p> The Vulkan graphics API is a big deal for mobile developers, since its direct GPU access allows for complex graphics to be rendered with a considerably lower hit to the processor, and thus a lower overhead on the hardware and battery life. A few devices like the SHIELD family and Samsung's 7 series already supported Vulkan several months ago, but Nougat now features full support for all updated Android 7.0 devices. Developer Super Evil Megacorp, which turned heads last year with its Vainglory mobile MOBA, now has a beta version that uses the Vulkan API. </p>
<p> The SHIELD Tablet is still going strong, right there with the SHIELD Android TV. (The original SHIELD Portable, not so much. Hey NVIDIA, where's that SHIELD 2 you guys were working on?) The original tablet and the slightly newer variant, the K1, were both updated to Android 6.0 a couple of months ago after a rocky start. But for some reason the K1 is getting the latest incremental update first. K1 update 1.2 adds Android 6.0.1, including the security patches from March. </p>
<p> Unless you regularly develop video games or other visually-intensive programs, you probably don't know what Vulkan is. That's OK. But if you are in the habit of developing visually complex apps for Android, the news that Google plans to support the Vulkan API is a big deal indeed. And it looks like the company intends to jump into the Vulkan pool with both feet: Google has just hired an entire team of dedicated Vulkan developers and folded them into the Android team. </p>
<p> Here's the gist: Vulkan is a cross-platform, low-overhead graphics API created by a consortium called Khronos (get it?). The advantage of Vulkan over other standards is that it gives developers direct access to GPU hardware, allowing a game to manually manage things like GPU cores and memory. </p>

<p> vulnerabilites </p>
<p> OnePlus is something of a darling among Android power users, shipping phones that can be bootloader unlocked without any special permissions or codes. But security researcher Roee Hay found that the OnePlus 3 (and the revised OnePlus 3T) are rather more open than was probably intended. With two native fastboot commands, Hay found he could install unverified boot images and disable the verified boot feature, all without actually unlocking the bootloader with the familiar user-accessible command. Which is, well, bad: it basically means anyone can run malicious code on the phone without resetting the user's data. </p>
<p> Calling all hackers and security researchers: Google wants to pay you money. Quite a lot, in fact. The top prize for finding a new critical flaw in Android in the new Project Zero Prize competition is a whopping $200,000, with the second prize at $100,000 and $50,000 split among additional entrants. The contest is being run by Project Zero, the company's own internal team of security researchers that documents critical flaws and bugs in wide-reaching software. </p>
<p> So you might have heard about the Stagefright vulnerability that was published yesterday. While there's no evidence of a widely-used hack, the potential for malicious MMS attacks via Android's built-in media handling system (which could theoretically affect the majority of Android devices currently in operation) is certainly cause for concern. As reported on our original post, Google has known about the vulnerability since April and has been working on patches to fix the problem. </p>
<p> We've received a statement attributed to a Google spokesperson [emphasis ours]: </p>
<p> This vulnerability was identified in a laboratory setting on older Android devices, and as far as we know, no one has been affected. </p>
<p> The Internet has been abuzz over the recently discovered Heartbleed bug. If you're not already familiar, Heartbleed is a vulnerability in the OpenSSL software library that allows an attacker to steal data directly from the memory space of an application and learn the private keys used to keep data securely encrypted as it travels over the Internet. The implications of this kind of leak are certainly severe, and it has everybody rushing to either install updates that fix the bug or implement workarounds to disable it. </p>
<p> As users, there's not a lot you can do to close this security hole on your device, but you might still want to know if you're vulnerable. </p>
<p> If you're a root user, listen up. Chainfire updated SuperSU to v1.69 as of last night, which fixes two exploits that could allow an attacker to leverage root privileges without first prompting the user. Probably nothing to get overly anxious about, but it's definitely a good idea to make sure you're running the latest. Details of these exploits will be released next Monday, so you'll want to grab the update before then. </p>
<p> Fortunately, this one's pretty easy – just install the update from the Play Store and you're covered; no need to flash anything. </p>
<p> This update also includes a handful of other fixes and things: </p>
<p> Changelog - XBIN mode (some new roots need this) - Slightly adjusted binary installer - Backup script installation now available for all backuptool-capable ROMs - Fixed su-ing to a non-root user not working on some 4.3+ firmwares - Fixed BOOTCLASSPATH vulnerability (CVE-2013-6774) - Fixed notification sanitization vulnerability (CVE-2013-6775) - Fixed possible closed special files vulnerability - Updated language files </p>
<p> The update is already live in the Play Store, so make sure to pull it down as soon as you can. </p>
<p> The security of our mobile apps and private data is a very serious matter. This is particularly true for high value targets like web browsers, which often store login credentials that can be used to access many of the websites we use on a regular basis. Unfortunately, browsers are also very complicated applications with an extensive set of features that are difficult to lock down completely. Sebastián Guerrero Selma of viaForensics recently posted a video demonstrating a newly discovered vulnerability in Firefox for Android which would allow hackers to access both the contents of the SD card and the browser's private data. </p>
<p> Second verse, same as the first. Two days ago the CyanogenMod ROM team announced a security update to the CM 10.1 platform, incorporating the "Master Key" security patch that Google had already issued back in February. Yesterday another, more intricate exploit in the same vein was posted by a Chinese blog, and again, Google has rapidly moved to patch the problem in Android... which won't be much comfort to those running an older release. Being the security-minded folks that they are, the CyanogenMod team has already patched the vulnerability in an even newer version of the ROM, CyanogenMod 10.1.2. </p>
<p> It's an easy fix if you know what you're doing: nine lines of code prevent malicious apps from skipping the signature verification built into Android. </p>
<p> Hot on the heels of Bluebox's disclosure of the "Master Key" exploit, a Chinese blog has posted details of a similar vulnerability. This attack also sidesteps a bug in the signature verification step and allows seemingly innocent APKs to include a potentially dangerous payload; and like its brethren, Google has already patched the flaw and posted it to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). The information comes to us from a China-based group (or possibly individual) calling itself the Android Security Squad. The original post is in Chinese, but a vaguely comprehensible translation can be had thanks to Google. </p>
<p> While most Android users are waiting on updaters that might patch some of the recently reported security holes, CyanogenMod is already getting a bug fix update out the door. CyanogenMod 10.1.1 is now hitting the stable channel for all supported devices. </p>
<p> The Master Key exploit will be presented by Jeff Forristal at Black Hat 2013 as "One Root To Own Them All." It's essentially a bug in signature verification which can be used to insert malicious code into an APK. Google patched the bug back in February, but the new code hasn't made it into most official ROMs – even Nexus devices have yet to receive the fix. </p>
<p> When it comes to root and mod action on Motorola devices from the last couple of years, all eyes turn to brilliant Android hacker Dan Rosenberg. Since the Droid 3 was released two years ago, Rosenberg has successfully found root exploits for every Motorola device, including the D3, Bionic, RAZR, Droid 4, Xoom 2, Atrix HD, RAZR HD, and RAZR M. Add to that the fact he just released a tool that unlocks the bootloaders on the most modern Moto phones (RAZR HD, M, and Atrix HD), and it's not hard to see why he's such an important part of the Motorola modding community. </p>

<p> In the early days of Android, ES File Explorer was one of the better ways to manage your storage. That hasn't been true for a long time, though. Not only is the app rather cluttered and buggy, security researcher Elliot Alderson (@fs0c131y on Twitter) points out this app makes your files vulnerable to theft. All you have to do is open it once. </p>
<p> Popular e-commerce website Newegg is the latest victim of cyber attacking by Magecart, according to Volexity, a cyberthreat monitoring firm. Newegg is one in a string of high profile cyber attacks making use of the card skimming code which recently compromised British Airways, Ticketmaster, and Feedify. Most critically, customer names and complete card details were stolen using exploited code between August 16th and September 18th. </p>
<p> T-Mobile customers, your data has been put at risk by your carrier, once again. In what seems like copypasta at this point, a security researcher recently found a bug in a publicly discoverable subdomain on T-Mobile's website that gave anyone access to customer data using just a phone number. It's almost like T-Mobile wants to award those bug bounties. </p>
<p> In the words of a famous disc jockey: "Another one." A young hacker-turned-security researcher in England found a critical vulnerability on T-Mobile's website that basically left records of user logins exposed online for hackers to pillage. The bug was reported and patched in December, and T-Mobile says no customer information was compromised as a result of this flaw. </p>
<p> Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. </p>
<p> Security has been a hot topic on Android for many years, particularly as smartphones take on increasingly significant roles both at home and at work. A single device acts as your main form of communication, contains personal photos and confidential documents, and may even have access to your finances. Google and other companies have made significant investments in time and money to ensure these devices are very hard to break into. However, a vulnerability was recently discovered in some phones that compromises important security measures and opens devices up to various types of attacks. The worst part is that it was created intentionally by a manufacturing partner contracted to build the phones, and the OEMs that designed the phone had no idea. </p>
<p> Google started taking security updates much more seriously last year after the Stage Fright vulnerability hit. Samsung followed suit, and even launched a monthly security bulletin mirroring Google's. Now, LG has a security bulletin site where it will post updates on vulnerabilities. First up, the May security bulletin, the most recent one Google has published. </p>
<p> A zero-day vulnerability in the Linux kernel was disclosed a few days ago, and that usually spells bad news for anything based on Linux. That includes Android, of course. When Perception Point announced the exploit (CVE-2016-0728), it claimed 66% of Android devices were affected. Google's Adrian Ludwig says the real number is much, much smaller. </p>
<p> In a blog post published today by the researchers at Zimperium Mobile Security, the group divulged an extremely widespread security vulnerability that can be exploited with nothing more than a targeted MMS message. The hole exists in the part of the Android operating system called Stagefright, which handles the processing of certain types of multimedia. </p>
<p> How it works </p>
<p> If targeted, the hypothetical hacker needs only to send an MMS message, which in many cases doesn't even need to be read before the attacker gains access to the victim's microphone and camera. </p>

<p> vulnerability </p>
<p> Twitter has patched its app from a vulnerability within Android that could let a malicious app siphon users' private date — including their direct messages — while bypassing system permissions. Every Twitter for Android user was notified about the security hole which affects users on versions 8 Oreo and 9 Pie. </p>
<p> Facebook went on a whack-a-mole expedition patching a security vulnerability that exposed thousands of WhatsApp users' phone numbers with a fairly simple Google search. The Indian researcher who found this loophole is also crying foul for not being able to receive a bounty for his bug find. </p>
<p> Security vulnerabilities are unfortunately extremely common in smartphones, given the complexity and varying codebases of most devices. That's why Google has been releasing monthly security patches for years, and if you needed another reason for why those updates are so important, the March 2020 release fixes a critical flaw on many MediaTek devices. </p>
<p> Mozilla has patched a zero-day exploit in late revisions to Firefox 72 and version 68 of the Android web browser. In a security advisory, the company said that it was made aware of "targeted attacks in the wild abusing this flaw." </p>
<p> Android security has come a long way in recent years. The promotion of monthly patches has kept many rising threats at bay while Google Play Protect largely bars malware from the Play Store. Despite these achievements, there are still instances where bad actors can exploit Android's code for nefarious purposes. Google's Project Zero team recently reported such an incident, and you may be at risk if you own one of the affected phones. </p>
<p> A research team has publicized about a vulnerability in Bluetooth that may affect nearly every device that supports the wireless communication protocol. Chipmakers were made aware to the so-called Key Negotiation of Bluetooth (KNOB) Attack in November. BlackBerry and Google have announced patches for Android devices. </p>
<p> Last year, the United States performed the first public test of the national Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA), an alert system designed to send messages to smartphones, TVs, and other systems simultaneously. The test was specifically for the 'Presidential Alert,' a new category that can't be opted out of (like AMBER alerts). It turns out these types of alerts can be easily spoofed, thanks to various security vulnerabilities with LTE towers. </p>
<p> Firefox developer Mozilla has rolled out an update to the release channel of its browser app for Android that adds an important security fix. The update to version number 67.0.3 patches the critical zero-day flaw and protects users from potential attacks. </p>
<p> Owners of the Nokia 9 PureView have had a rough go with the in-display fingerprint sensor they've bought their phones — our Ryan Whitwam was not impressed with the fussing around and finger-jambing he had to do in order to achieve authentication. A software update last week was supposed to loosen up and get the sensor working as it should. But manufacturer HMD Global is now investigating a complaint saying that the phone is too loose, producing false positives from unknown fingers and even a packet of gum. </p>
<p> Cybersecurity researchers from Check Point have unearthed a vulnerability in WhatsApp that could allow attackers to trick users by intercepting messages and editing the content. This opens up the possibility of scamming people and spreading misinformation. </p>

<p> Vulnerability Rewards Program </p>
<p> Last year, Google seriously stepped up the payouts and categories for its bug bounty programs, and that investment appears to be paying dividends — not just for Google, but for security researchers, too. The company is currently celebrating its most prolific payouts ever for the Vulnerability Reward Program (read: Google's bug bounty), handing out over $6.5 million in rewards. Google claims this is twice as much as the company has ever given out in a previous year — not quite true according to 2018's numbers. </p>
<p> Elite hackers aren't the only thing Google has to worry about when it comes to its platforms. Perhaps just as pernicious are simple abuses of its systems and products — often stumbled upon by an average person with too much time on their hands. For instance, finding ways to purchase items from Google without paying, or getting around restrictions on content use and sharing. It's these issues that the Mountain View tech giant is aiming to uncover by officially expanding its Vulnerability Reward Program to include reports on techniques to successfully bypass its abuse, fraud and spam systems. </p>
<p> 2017 was a big year for security research in technology, just as it is every year. With the much publicised 'Meltdown' and 'Spectre' CPU vulnerabilities and countless other lesser-known security bugs, researchers had their work cut out uncovering these flaws before anyone with more nefarious intentions could. </p>
<p> Google does its bit to compensate the research community for their hard work in keeping its users protected. In a recent blog post, the company released some numbers for the 2017 Vulnerability Rewards Program while also paying tribute to the dedicated researchers. Google paid out a total of $2.9 million as part of the program, to individuals and teams in 60 different countries. </p>

<p> Every few weeks for so, Google updates the Android Auto website with a list of newly-supported cars. This time around, though, there are far more cars (and head units) than usual from a wide variety of brands that have just had AA support added. </p>
<p> The Volkswagen Jetta is, admittedly, the occasional butt of car enthusiast jokes. Long considered a slightly snobby small economy sedan because of its comparatively high price of entry and less-than-great reliability reviews, the car didn't sell amazingly well here in the states for quite some time. Five years ago, VW tried to turn that sales situation around, completely redesigning the Jetta and drastically reducing the cost of many of its constituent parts - the result was the Mk.VI Jetta, and sales did go up quite noticeably. </p>
<p> But the car was compromised, and reviewers generally weren’t fans. Cost-cuts included things like fitting an unrefined rear beam-axle suspension system on most models, ditching optional leather trims, saddling the base car with a gutless 2.0-liter naturally-aspirated 4-cylinder engine, and conducting most of the design and assembly in Mexico instead of Germany. </p>
<p> At an event in California earlier today, Volkswagen officially announced that upcoming 2016 VW models will be Android Auto-ready. Which models? For now, what we know is this: most model year 2016 VWs at "SE" trim and above will likely pack the generation two MIB infotainment system, which has Android Auto (and Apple CarPlay). There are 6.5" and 8" versions of MIB 2, but both offer the same Auto experience. </p>

<p> vysor </p>
<p> Earlier this month, Google announced they were killing off Chrome apps for Mac, Windows, and Linux. While it makes logical sense to remove a feature that almost no Chrome users actually used, there are still hundreds of excellent Chrome apps affected by the decision. Google recommends that developers move their applications to Electron (another way to run web apps on the desktop), but doing that would require rewriting every component using Chrome's APIs to the Electron equivalents. </p>
<p> Koush, developer of the Chrome app Vysor (among other projects), has made porting Chrome apps to Electron incredibly easy. With his tool, aptly named Electron Chrome, developers can compile their existing Chrome apps into Electron applications in seconds. </p>
<p> Koushik Dutta, a.k.a Koush, is one of Android's most popular developers. From the custom recovery ClockworkMod to ROM Manager, to Allcast, to Vysor, his apps are downloaded almost religiously amongst power users, developers, and tinkerers. In the last few hours, he's made a new app available in beta, named Inkwire. </p>
<p> Based on Koush's previous app, Vysor, which mirrors your Android device's screen on a computer, Inkwire goes one step further and shares the screen to another Android device, letting someone else help with a problem or issue, which could be especially useful for tech support workers or, as Koush says, independent app developers. </p>
<p> Vysor is a useful app for developers, designers, or just people who are curious about Android and want to see cool stuff on their computer. The app mirrors an Android device's screen on a computer, which uses a Chrome app with ADB to provide the interface between the phone or tablet and the computer. It should see many more downloads now, with Koush having uploaded his app to the Play Store. </p>
<p> Vysor can also be installed via ADB, using the aforementioned Chrome app. The Android app on its own does nothing; it will simply prompt you to get the app from the Chrome Web Store. However, </p>
<p> Koush has really kicked Vysor development into high gear after MPEG-LA came calling to demand its pound of flesh, and that's good for anyone who needs to manage a mess of test devices. Vysor now has a Share All feature, which makes it a snap to set up a device farm for testing. Yes, this is part of the paid version of the app, but it's cheaper than enterprise plans at a cloud testing service. </p>
<p> Koush had to take his device mirroring tool Vysor off the Chrome store last week after H.264 owner MPEG-LA came calling with a big bill. It seems the H.264 decoder in Vysor entitled MPEG-LA to royalties on Koush's free app. Well, after a weekend of coding, Vysor is back with a new decoder and a subscription option. </p>
<p> If you go looking for Koush's Vysor today, you won't be able to find it. Koush has announced that he had to pull the screen sharing app because of codec licensing. Despite being more or less ubiquitous, the H.264 codec isn't a free standard. Koush was contacted by MPEG-LA and told he'd need to license the decoder in Vysor for $0.20 per user. Koush opted to pull the tool from the Chrome web store instead, but he's on the hook for previous downloads. </p>
<p> Koush's Vysor is pretty cool: a way to see your Android screen on a computer, using a Chrome extension. This is great for using an Android app on your desktop PC, or for developers debugging apps. Previously, Vysor's 'Share' feature has worked between two people who have both had Vysor installed. Now, however, you can share with anyone, even if they do not have Vysor. </p>
<p> Simply press share on Vysor's control panel, and the link will be automatically copied to the computer's clipboard. All that's needed then is that link to be pasted to the intended recipient, who can then view the phone or tablet in Chrome or Firefox. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/06/19 8:53am PDTon Jun 19, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/14 6:01am PDTon Jul 14, 2020. </p>
<p> The first Galaxy S20 units are already receiving the July security patch in Korea and Europe, but in the US, the slow carrier rollout of the June update continues to arrive on many people's phones. People using a Galaxy S10 device on T-Mobile can look forward to the patch, which is only now starting to roll out to them. Along with the security enhancements, the phones are getting smaller system and performance improvements. </p>
<p> Despite some of our misgivings about the Lenovo-owned Motorola, the company is still producing some decent devices. Misguided zealotry over mods aside, the Moto Z2 Play has proven to be an okay phone. If you're a Verizon customer, then Best Buy is offering the Z2 Play for just $7.99/month, making the phone cost $191.76, a whole $216 off MSRP. </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Note8, S8+, and S8 may be enjoying a small bump in interest from consumers who are growing increasingly wary of the Pixel 2 and 2 XL. So it seems Best Buy is striking while the iron of worry is hot by offering $250 off each of these three Samsung smartphones if activated on Verizon, and $200 off each of them if activated on AT&T. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are getting extremely cheap for what they are, especially considering they're only about three months old. We're not entirely sure why, but hey, we're not going to complain about it. The latest deal is for the Verizon models at Best Buy, where you can pick the S8 up for just $17.50 a month ($420 total) or the S8+ for just $21.50 a month ($516 total). </p>
<p> Verizon isn't known for having the best prices so much as it is for great coverage, but that doesn't mean it can't offer up some good deals once in a while. Big Red currently has the Pixel and Pixel XL for just $15 and 20 per month, respectively, and it's throwing a free Google Home in. There are also some other nice deals available, such as the Moto Z Play Droid for $5/month and the LG Stylo 2 V for free. </p>
<p> Out of the big four US carriers, three - AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile - have already pushed the Android 7.0 Nougat update to their versions of the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. Now, though, Verizon is also sending out this long-awaited OS upgrade to its variants of Samsung's flagship. </p>
<p> Google's premiere devices for Android Wear 2.0, the LG Watch Style and Sport, had details leaked well before the official announcement today. By contrast, Verizon's announcement comes as something of a surprise. In a blog post discussing how Verizon will offer the LG Watch Sport, the company also announced its own exclusive 'Wear24' smartwatch. </p>
<p> Verizon is known for bundling large amounts of pre-installed applications with little value, hence the term 'bloatware.' Unfortunately, it seems like the Verizon-sold Google Pixel phones are no exception. </p>
<p> According to a page on Verizon's website, the Pixel includes eight "Preloaded Play Store Apps," besides the usual Google-made apps bundled with most Android devices. The included apps from Verizon are My Verizon, Go90, and VZ Messages. There are other Google apps pre-loaded outside of the usual bundle as well, including Allo, Duo, Android Pay, Docs, and Keep. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Verizon does not make it clear if their bloatware applications are uninstallable or not. </p>
<p> In recent years, WiFi calling has become increasingly prevalent on various carriers and devices; the recently-announced Pixel and Pixel XL back up this fact. Google has confirmed that the Pixel smartphones will support WiFi calling for both T-Mobile and Verizon upon launch. </p>

<p> W2 </p>
<p> April 15th is right around the corner. If you're not one of the early birds that files your before Spring, your procrastination is about to pay off. H&R block has introduced a new app for Android phones that allows you to enter W2 information into your tax return by taking a photo of the document. Taxes just got fun! Or, at least, a little less tedious. </p>
<p> Truth be told, it almost seems inevitable that filing taxes would become largely automated. </p>
<p> Nobody likes to do their taxes but, unfortunately, the tax season is almost upon us, and I'm dreading and counting down the days until April 18th (this year's tax day is not the 15th). However, those of you who have relatively simple taxes have a new option to file this year, one that wouldn't even make you touch a computer - TurboTax SnapTax for Android. </p>
<p> If you've made less than $80K, the income was all a result of W2s, interest, or unemployment, and if you don't claim any dependents or real estate, SnapTax is for you. </p>

<p> During times when a lot of people are requesting rides, Uber prices go up. It makes sense: higher fares incentivize drivers to be available to give rides during high-traffic times, which keeps customers happy. If you have more time than money, though, you'll probably be pleased to hear that the ridesharing company is testing an option to call a car for later at a lower cost. </p>
<p> This article describes how to add hard and soft pauses to your contacts' phone numbers on your Android phone. </p>
<p> These tricks are quite useful, but it surprises me how relatively unpublished and unknown they are. </p>
<p> What's This All About? </p>
<p> I'm sure you can think of a situation where having some sort of a pause in a phone number could save quite a bit of time, as you could program the whole sequence once and never enter it manually again. </p>
<p> For example, I have a calling card which asks me a whole bunch of information, like the language I want the menu in, my account and pin, and the phone number I want to dial. </p>

<p> After a day filled with Android-flavored excitement (Google Edition phones!), disappointment (they're not really Google Edition phones, and SHIELD is late at the gate), and all points in between, it's time to kick back with some sweet app and game sales. Because no matter how good or bad your day was, saving money is never a let-down. Let's get right to it, shall we? </p>
<p> The WakeVoice license giveaway attracted over 600 entries, and after sorting through all of them and picking 20 at random, we're ready to congratulate the following folks and send them free licenses: </p>
<p> We've passed your emails along to WakeVoice, so you should be getting your codes shortly. </p>
<p> WakeVoice </p>
<p> There are dozens of alternative alarms out there, but ever since I discovered WakeVoice way back in November, it's been my favorite. The biggest reason: I can lay in bed for a few minutes after I wake up and not feel bad about it since WakeVoice reads me the weather and news (it can also read your horoscope and, depending on your phone, your calendar). The app uses the stock Android speech synthesis voice, but third-party voices are linked from within the app and can be purchased. </p>
<p> Remember that scene in Iron Man where Tony Stark sleeps with the journalist (Christine Everhart), and then in the morning, Jarvis wakes her up by reading the current weather, surf conditions, and so on? Yeah, now your Android device can do that. </p>
<p> I was looking for a picture that showed the UI on the glass, but this will do nicely. </p>
<p> The app is called WakeVoice, and it's a pretty excellent idea - to quote the developer: </p>

<p> Normally when we see one of these pay-what-you-want Android game bundles, they come to us from the good ol' reliable Humble Bundle folks. This time around, we're looking at a package of games available from StackSocial. </p>
<p> There are seven games total, though you have to beat the average to get more than two of them. It currently sits at just over $4, but it's sure to rise over the course of the next thirteen days. </p>
<p> Humble Bundle With Android 6 was already a good deal before, as it offered seven games, five of which were debuting on Android for the first time. Now, three additional titles are joining the ranks. Those who have already bought the bundle will see McPixel, Waking Mars, and NightSky appear in their Humble Bundle libraries automatically. Those who haven't yet bought the bundle just have to pay over the average price paid thus far, which has yet to exceed $5. </p>
<p> Just like its collection of new apps, the Play Store made a strong showing in the game department last month. From Ingress to Clay Jam, there were plenty of great new games to choose from in November. With games, as with apps, there are often too many to download and try each one. To that end, we've rounded up the top seven games every Android gamer will want to take a look at from November 2012. </p>
<p> When you pick up your Android device to play a game, you're probably shooting stuff, jumping over stuff, driving stuff, or maybe flicking stuff. Lather, rinse, repeat. Sometimes these gaming tropes can be genuinely entertaining and clever, but it's all rather expected these days. Waking Mars takes a completely different approach. It's equal parts puzzle solving and adventure, with just a little platforming mixed in. It's a little expensive, but does it deliver? </p>
<p> If you're into indie games, chances are you've heard of Waking Mars by now. If you haven't - check it out, this is one seriously awesome puzzle / platformer mashup with an epic story and amazing soundtrack. It actually just hit the Play Store, too, after being available on Android exclusively through the Humble Bundle that went live last week (still up now). </p>
<p> So, why buy it for $5 through the Play Store instead of the pay-what-you-want Humble Bundle? </p>

<p> walking </p>
<p> In the world of activity trackers, nothing comes close to the Mi Band's value. Cheaper than any Garmin or Fitbit tracker, even the most basic vivofit4 and Inspire, but still packing enough functionality, it also benefits from Xiaomi's name recognition and is considered a serious choice, not a cheap knock-off no-name tracker. </p>
<p> The most recent Mi Band 4 pushes the value-for-money envelop even further thanks to a colored AMOLED screen, swim tracking, and music controls, which get added on top of the previous generation's all-day activity, sleep, and heart rate tracking. Overall, the package is very attractive, but cracks are inevitably hiding below the surface, especially if you like spending your time in a pool. </p>
<p> Walking is a big part of Pokémon Go; you have to walk not only to find monsters to catch, but also to hatch the eggs that are often the easiest way to get your hands on some of the rarer critters in the game. You have to have the app open for it to log your distance traveled, though, which is kind of a pain — but that's changing soon. </p>
<p> Location games' Run An Empire is a brand new augmented reality app that ingeniously gamifies walking, jogging, and running. Similar apps already exist on the Play Store, though Run an Empire takes the AR gameplay into a whole new direction. Instead of running away from zombies or defending Earth against alien invaders, you will be tasked with building an empire through the ages. It's like someone combined the 4X game Civilization with an exercise app. </p>
<p> Recently, Samsung's Indian R&D released a new app called Walk Mode. It's advertised as notifying you if there is a danger present as you go about your business using your phone while walking. Safety is quite a noble endeavor for Samsung to be pursuing, and I'd like to say that the company's efforts paid off, but I would be lying. </p>
<p> It might be a bit later than the competition, but this new feature certainly isn't unwanted. Now when you request a ride in Lyft, you might be shown alternative pickup locations to save you extra time. That way if your driver has to navigate a complex area to get to you, you can shave off some extra driving time with a short walk, and everyone gets where they're going faster. </p>
<p> Google began rolling out an update to Maps v9.26.1 a few days ago, and it's sporting a handful of new features. Like so many versions of maps, there are quite a few well-hidden changes in this one, far more than the single item written in the official changelog. Most of the changes are subtle enough that you won't notice them if you're not comparing side-by-side, but they are improvements all the same. There are even a few things from the teardown that don't appear to have made this version, but should be things to watch out for in the future. </p>
<p> What's New </p>
<p> Official Changelog: </p>
<p> Search along the route in bicycling and walking navigation. </p>
<p> Human's activity and fitness tracker has been available on iOS since 2013, but it has just decided to get its running shoes on and ride to the Android side. The app takes a passive approach to activity tracking, working in the background on your phone to figure out everything (walks, runs, bike rides) you've done throughout the day. If this sounds familiar, it's because it's very similar to Google Fit or to the previous "celebrity" in the category, Moves. </p>
<p> Where Human is slightly different is in its focus on trying to make you actively move more throughout the day. </p>
<p> Texting and driving is a big no-no. We get that. People still do it, but it isn't from the misguided belief that they aren't being risky or, in some places, breaking the law. Yet what about texting and walking? It may not result in unintentional manslaughter (okay, it's much less likely to result in accidental death), but that doesn't mean it's harmless. </p>
<p> In Japan, wireless carrier NTT Docomo has been trying to educate the public on the dangers of walking while having their eyes glued on a mobile device. In typical Japanese fashion, the company's doing so in an adorable, somewhat humorous fashion. </p>
<p> There's a reason Moves has attracted millions of downloads on iOS. It doesn't require the purchase of a separate device, instead turning the smartphone that's already in your pocket into a pedometer. This isn't unheard of on Android, but Moves is available for free and isn't weighed down by ads. ProtoGeo wants Moves to be an app that mainstream people actually use, and that means keeping it clean, simple, and non-intrusive. </p>
<p> No, seriously, Moves is simple. When you fire up the app for the first time, it informs you that it will track your steps, and that's it. </p>
<p> My power went out last night. This wasn't as scary of an experience when I had a dumb phone, which could last multiple days without having to be charged. Now that I'm toting around a 5-inch monster with a quad-core processor, I'm nervous if my phone will even last until nightfall. That's why when I saw that SolePower had met their $50,000 goal on Kickstarter in order to develop a shoe insole that charges portable electronics while we walk, they had my undivided attention. </p>
<p> SolePower's insole slides into your usual footwear and charges a small battery as you walk, generating power both between steps and on impact. </p>

<p> Google's on a roll today with app updates; first it was the new Google Voice featuring not one, but two widgets, and now they're rolling out a new version of Google Maps which promises to teach us to "walk this way." </p>
<p> The update includes a feature called "Walking Navigation," which is essentially turn-by-turn navigation, only for pedestrians and not drivers. It is now able to: </p>
<p> provide up-to-the minute walking directions to from where you stand now to your destination, complete with blue and white arrows to indicate where you stand and where you should go </p>
<p> offer voice guidance (which can be turned off) </p>
<p> a map that rotates as you rotate </p>
<p> turn on satellite imagery by default </p>
<p> Revolutionary it may not be, but it's certainly an improvement over the feature it replaces, "Walking Directions." </p>

<p> Walkman </p>
<p> Look, we're not in the audiophile business. We don't cover music products that don't feature Android in some way, shape, or form. And running bleeding-edge software is not a prerequisite for quality sound. But seriously, Sony, if you're going to charge twelve hundred dollars for a device that runs Android, could you not load it with an OS build that's over two years old? Alas, such is the case with the Walkman NW-ZX2 announced at CES. </p>
<p> The rollout for all three devices is beginning today and continuing over the next few weeks in global markets, so keep an eye on your notifications if you're eager to update your software. </p>
<p> As well as updating users' devices to Ice Cream Sandwich, this latest update also comes with new Sony media applications, including a new Walkman app. </p>
<p> Sony, as part of a trio of new phones, today announced the Xperia V at IFA. The Xperia V carries specs similar to the newly-announced Xperia T, but has a unique twist: the device is water and dust resistant, with the ability to withstand full submersion as deep as a meter for an estimated thirty minutes. </p>
<p> Those who enjoy promotional videos may also be interested in seeing Sony's "Xperia – Designing out Smartphones" video, which takes a look at just how this new lineup of devices came to be. </p>
<p> Update: Sony has announced pricing and availability. The F800 will be available starting in August (next month), and the 16GB version will start at $269.99, with 32GB costing $299.99. That's some seriously premium pricing, so let's hope these devices provide a real premium experience to go along with it. </p>
<p> Refusing the let the Walkman die, Sony just announced the newest iteration of the series: the F800. The newest member of the Walkman family runs Android 4.0, has a 3.5" multi-touch display, a Tegra 2 dual-core processor (why?), </p>
<p> Sony may have disappointed by backing out of bringing Ice Cream Sandwich to its PlayStation-certified Xperia Play, but there are still several other Xperia devices out there due an upgrade to Android 4.0. Having recently dealt with the Xperia Arc and Neo, next up is the pint-sized pocket slider, the Xperia Mini Pro. As you might expect, this will include Sony's usual UI customizations, but considering the Xperia Mini Pro's rather unique form factor such additions may be welcome in this case. </p>
<p> Sony is a company going through major changes - it recently announced plans to lay off 10,000 plus of its workers (some of those through buyouts), has instated a new CEO, and just had one of its worst fiscal years ever. It also recently ended its Android smartphone partnership with Ericsson, and plans to now produce handsets under its own name. It's a difficult and uncertain time for Sony, and the Walkman Z, unfortunately, seems to be an excellent microcosm of the company's larger problems. </p>
<p> Following its recent announcement of the "Live With Walkman" Android smartphone, Sony has today officially introduced the Walkman Z Series (Japanese press release) of personal media players. </p>
<p> These Android 2.3 devices will weigh approximately 156g and will feature the following specs: </p>
<p> Built-in mono speaker (this is an interesting choice considering this device is billed as a "Walkman" phone) </p>
<p> HDMI output </p>
<p> DLNA </p>
<p> As these devices are billed as "Walkman" PMPs the lack of a camera is not entirely surprising. </p>
<p> The "Walkman" brand name, originally created by Sony over 30 years ago, lives on in Sony Ericsson's newest Android device, the "Live with Walkman". This diminutive smartphone, announced in a press release earlier today, will be a music playing device first and foremost with a dedicated music discovery button and "deep Facebook integration," which means it will most likely carry something similar to (or exactly like) Sony's "Facebook inside Xperia" interface. </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson Indonesia has quietly announced to the world that they will be putting out the first Android-based Walkman device, the W8. This is by no means a power house, though, with a 600MHz processor, 168MB of RAM, a 3.2 megapixel camera, and a 3" 320x480 screen; clearly, this phone is aimed at the budget market. </p>
<p> This device will run Android 2.1 and the same version of Timescape as the X10 mini, with some tweaks to the Mediascape music interface to give users the Walkman experience. </p>

<p> Earlier this month, Google pushed up a Play Store listing for its new Search Suggestions app for Pixel phones, which powers — as you'd likely guess from the name — both the search functionality inside the Settings app and the suggestions which appear at the top. Now three more Pixel-specific apps have hit the Play Store: Pixel Tips, Connectivity Health Services, and Voice Action Services. Pixel Tips powers an animated guide that introduces you to your Pixel 3, Voice Action Services is connected in some imprecisely defined way to voice-based Assistant actions, and Connectivity Health Services does... </p>
<p> When I was younger, video game tips came in one of two forms: a Nintendo hotline that you could call to get someone to walk you through the game, or you could find a written guide in one giant doc with some kind of ASCII art at the top. You kids today get all the nice stuff. Like video walkthroughs delivered directly to your phone or tablet via Break Media's new GameFront app. </p>
<p> The app is completely free and has access to tons of videos covering a variety of games for various platforms. The walkthroughs are curated, so it's not just a random assortment of links to YouTube clips. </p>
<p> It was only a matter of time after the dev units shipped out that we could expect to see a thorough walkthrough on the part of a new owner, and here it is. Some of what we're seeing in this trio of videos, we've already seen in the official Ouya unboxing. However, a few new details have been highlighted. For starters, in the top center of the controllers, there are touchpads that can be used for cursor control. Also, as we learned before, they will require two AA batteries. Well, that's a bummer. </p>
<p> Of course, what we all really want to see is the interface. </p>
<p> It’s not much of a secret that Amazon is quickly becoming one of my favorite companies. The way they have embraced Android is wonderful, creating diversity where there used to be none. I recently ran down some of the pros and cons of the Amazon Appstore for Android, which is starting to become my go-to marketplace for new apps. Now they have released a new music streaming service, Cloud Player, which brings some of the functionality that was originally a hope of Google Music to my Droid. </p>
<p> Cloud Drive and the Web App </p>
<p> The Cloud Player is basically a frontend to all of the music that is stored in the Cloud Drive (which can be used to store any file type). </p>
<p> The GO Dev Team, the people who brought you the popular apps GO SMS, GO Weather, and GO Launcher, are at it again, bringing you a contacts manager and dialer that is, quite frankly, stunning, both in functionality and aesthetics. It dropped into the market not 12 hours ago and is already getting very popular as well as garnering great reviews. Let's take a closer look, shall we? </p>
<p> The first thing you'll notice upon installing it is that there are actually two parts to the application that will be called by your device separately: The dialer and the contacts manager. </p>
<p> Thanks to Droid Life, you can now sift through that clumsy collection of instructions you never would have read otherwise. Nonetheless, go ahead and download the guide if you so desire; we didn't discover anything previously unknown during our preliminary reading, but who knows - something new and exciting could be contained within! </p>
<p> Honeycomb is one of the biggest updates in Android history, so naturally, I jumped at the chance to try it out via the newly released Android 3.0 "preview SDK." What I found certainly wasn't disappointing - though it's important to remember that this is just a preview, meaning that not everything is in working order (for example, the emulator is so slow it made me want to tear my hair out at times, not to mention the frequent force close messages). Join us below for our first impressions of the new UI elements and other features found in Android 3.0 "Honeycomb." </p>
<p> A couple of weeks ago at CES 2011, Sony Ericsson announced its latest Android handset - the sleek and sexy Gingerbread-running Xperia Arc. They've also invited the press, Android Police included, to attend a media breakfast where we ended up spending over an hour of quality time with the new device, documented in great detail here. If you have questions about the Arc, I highly recommend you dive into the above post, as it contains a plethora of useful bits and pieces, all wrapped in a convenient package. </p>
<p> Though the Arc was promised to land in consumers' hands sometime in Q1 2011 and no review units have been sent out just yet, the writers from an Italian blog HDBlog.it </p>
<p> While Toshiba's original attempts at an Android tablet running on the Tegra chip didn't exactly go down a storm, they seem keen to continue with Android devices, and brought a new tablet with them to CES. Artem got a video demo from one of their reps, and as you can see there are some attractive features to note. </p>
<p> Like the Motorola XOOM, the nameless Toshiba tablet (henceforth "Anon") has a 10.1" WXGA (1280x800) screen, which was unsurprisingly nice and crisp. It also sports the convenience of full-size USB and HDMI ports, along with a full SD card slot allowing for storage expansion up to 64 GB. </p>
<p> Following on from their press release on Wednesday, Sony Ericsson invited the media this morning to a designated conference room at the Hard Rock Hotel for some play time with their newest Android device. We spent over an hour with the handset to get an idea of what to expect when it hits the market. </p>
<p> The reps there acknowledged the difficulties they had experienced with their previous Android handsets, and showed what appeared to be decisive commitment to putting those hold-ups behind them. With the Xperia arc (sic), Sony Ericsson has trumped its competition at CES with the first Gingerbread device to be announced since the Nexus S. </p>

<p> Google's new Nest Mini, revealed at the company's Made By Google 2019 event, replaces the much-loved and nearly ubiquitous Home Mini. The older Assistant-powered speaker has been discounted and bundled with so many deals over the last couple of years, most of us probably have one on a shelf or side-table somewhere. So why is it worth your while to consider the newer model and its $49 price tag? </p>
<p> A couple of weeks ago, Google gave developers a way to offer promo codes for their apps. Shortly after, we teamed up with the developer of LocalCast to hand out 50 promo codes for the premium version of the app, which was a great success. Today, we’re teaming up with the dev behind Backdrops, a popular wallpaper app, to give out 50 codes for Backdrops Pro. Let’s go. </p>
<p> First off, if you haven’t tried Backdrops, I feel bad for you, son. It’s essentially a premier way to find new wallpapers on Android, and the majority of the content there is exclusive so you won’t get it anywhere else. </p>
<p> We all love new Nexus accessories right? After all, Google doesn't have a spotless track record with providing accessories for their own line of phones and tablets. Today, Google added one item to the lineup - a Nexus Charging Accessory. The don't-call-it-a-travel-adaptor accessory is a basic micro USB cable with a block, just as you'd expect. </p>
<p> For reference, the accessory is listed as a 1.8A adapter. The Nexus 5's stock adapter is 1.2A, the new Nexus 7's charger is 1.35A, and Samsung has been shipping 2A adapters of late. So while this may be a bit faster than your other Nexus chargers, you might not see a mind-blowing boost in charging speed. </p>
<p> Back in 2011, Eric Schmidt (among others) predicted that Android would soon power home devices, including refrigerators and other appliances. Samsung fulfilled the refrigerator vision with the RF4289. We've questioned the wisdom of Android-powered appliances in the past, but today's pre-CES announcement from Dacor is definitely worth talking about. The California-based company, known for manufacturing quality home appliances, has just announced an Android-powered in-wall oven. </p>
<p> That's right – a (thirty inch) smart oven is on the way, and it's powered by a seven-inch device (called the Discovery IQ controller) with Android … ahem … baked in. And guess what – it runs the Play Store. </p>
<p> If you belong to the dying breed of people still using Facebook (at least that's what everyone on Google+ seems to think), I think you will find today's tip quite handy, to say the least. </p>
<p> As it turns out, you can actually delete wall posts and comments (on your own wall or ones you created) as well as archive messages all by swiping away the item in question. Both left-to-right and right-to-left gestures seem to work, though left-to-right is a bit more reliable and natural. </p>
<p> Note: The gesture doesn't work everywhere - for example, it didn't work when I tried to swipe away a post by page (Android Police), probably because it still uses the old layout. </p>

<p> wall charger </p>
<p> Do you still have a power bank that runs off of microUSB? Maybe a wall charger that only does 18W? Perhaps your friend or a loved one does? Do them or yourself a favor by getting on this deal for an Anker power bundle, now $39 off for a limited time. </p>
<p> It’s only now that we’re seeing 30W charging speeds available more widely on phones and faster 65W tech is slowly making its way into the mainstream. Now Realme has an even quicker solution that is capable of topping up your phone from 0 to 100 in a matter of minutes. The Chinese smartphone maker today introduced its 125W UltraDart charging standard — if you're getting déjà vu, it's because this is eerily similar to the technology launched by sister company Oppo just yesterday. </p>
<p> Filling up several devices simultaneously can be a pain. Thankfully, some wall chargers come with several ports, making it simpler to plug in two phones or tablets at once. Aukey's product, which can deliver up to 18W, is now down to just $7 on Amazon, which is 55% off compared to its traditional MSRP. </p>
<p> What I like the most with USB-C chargers is that I can use the same one to charge my phones, laptop, and tablet. Sadly, 60W ones tend to be bulky and expensive. Surprisingly, Choetech's offering is compact and powerful enough to charge a laptop or MacBook Pro, and is currently down to just $16 thanks to this deal. </p>
<p> Looking to get an absolute unit of a wall charger? Look no further than RAVPower's 61W USB-C charger featuring Gallium Nitride technology. That tech means it's plenty smaller than other warts at a similar capacity and it's down to its best price yet on Amazon. </p>
<p> You probably have a lot of USB Type-A wall adapters around your home, but what about newer USB Type-C chargers? Aukey's adorably-small wall adapter is now just $7.98 on Amazon when you use a coupon code. </p>
<p> You probably already have a few devices that support USB Power Delivery fast charging, but the wall adapters for some of them can get unwieldy — especially most of the ones that come with laptops. If you're looking for something more compact, or just a spare to have around when you need it, Aukey's small 60W charger is now just $24.49 right now on Amazon. </p>

<p> Whether you charge multiple devices by your bedside or you prefer to pack light while traveling, there's no greater convenience than owning a single charger that can manage multiple devices at once. It's even better when you can find a charging solution that's compatible with both USB-C and USB-A connections. Today you can pick up this highly rated RAVPower PD Pioneer 61W charger for $23 ($13 off) at Amazon. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Note10+ supports "super fast charging" with compatible 45W chargers. Unfortunately, the manufacturer doesn't provide one in the box and instead sells it separately for a whopping $50, which isn't necessarily worth paying for. Thankfully, the charger is now down to $35, making this a more interesting purchase. </p>
<p> Hello and welcome to the second Monday of February! We have a fresh batch of deals that are ripe for the taking. Headlining this week, we found even more discounts on the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL, plus we tracked down some affordable true wireless earbuds, a powerful wall charger, and a charging cube that should absolutely replace that old power strip crammed behind your TV or under your desk. Let's get started! </p>

<p> wall chargers </p>
<p> There is never a good time for a charger or cable to go bust, missing, or pilfered, but if you're looking for some replacements at the moment, then today is the day to get them from Anker — the power peripherals maker has a number of Deals of the Day on Amazon today. </p>
<p> Oppo promised a delivery of massive power yesterday. Today, it brings on the surge with the announcement of four charging products: a 50W wall charger based on its SuperVOOC standard, a conceptual 65W AirVOOC wireless pad, a 110W mini flash charger, and a 125W full-size flash charger. </p>

<p> Is there anything worse than watching the battery icon on your favorite smart device hit 1%? The sad truth is that our phones, tablets, and computers are pretty useless without the power to keep them running. On this week's Wednesday roundup, we're featuring deals on portable batteries and wall chargers that will ensure your devices stay juiced up, no matter where your day takes you. </p>
<p> It's the week before Thanksgiving and you're probably about to head off to the relatives or to a friend's apartment to share in a meal, some laughs, and maybe a good dose of anxiety. One source of anxiety you'd want to nip right from the bud is power sourcing — you've got gadgets, after all. Fortunately, Anker has a few good deals running today only on Amazon to satisfy your needs. </p>
<p> Accessories makers tend to come onto Amazon with their Deals of the Day as if it were a carousel. This day, it's Aukey's turn and we're tracking a dozen products on sale for at least 20% off. From keyboards to Bluetooth earbuds to speakers and chargers (a load of chargers), we've got them parsed down for your participation and consumption. You just need to act before midnight PDT tonight. </p>
<p> If you're in the position where the biggest phone is the better phone for you, the Galaxy Note10+ will hit that mark for you — it's got a bigger screen with more pixels and it has a bigger battery than the normal Note. But if you really want to take advantage of the fastest rates you can get for your plus-sized phablet, you'll need to ditch the wall wart in the box and buy another one. Don't worry, we'll explain why and help you out. </p>

<p> wallet </p>
<p> Google decided some time ago that the power button on Android phones could be useful for quick access to commonly-used features. An iOS-style wallet was added to the Pixel in March so you can switch between payment cards or bring up travel passes and loyalty cards when you need them, and next on the list is smart home controls. Evidence of this arrived with Android 11's developer previews, but freshly leaked documentation now shows us what the final product is going to look like. </p>
<p> Google Pay's new power menu quick access interface has been in the making for a long time and finally became official as part of the March Pixel feature drop. Thus, we've been using the quick wallet for a few weeks already, but we've only recently been pointed to another interesting new UI hiding behind the rightmost "View all" entry. When you enter Google Pay that way, you're greeted by a bottom-bar-less design that shows you both your payment methods and your loyalty cards in a one-page layout. </p>
<p> As we predicted last week, Google's latest quarterly Feature Drop is rolling out for Pixel phones today. Unlike the regular monthly security releases, this update includes a ton of new features, including a new play/pause gesture for Pixel 4's Motion Sense, a wider rollout of car crash detection, dark theme scheduling, Live Caption for the Pixel 2, a new power button wallet, live Duo AR effects, a pile of new emoji, and a whole lot more. </p>
<p> In what seems to be a theme today, Opera has revealed it's launching a private beta for a crypto-integrated version of its browser. This new beta adds a built-in wallet for cryptocurrencies as well as support for Ethereum-based decentralized applications (Dapps, for those in the know). </p>
<p> Samsung Pay and Android Pay/Google Pay have been around for years at this point, but there are plenty of other mobile payment solutions. LG Pay has existed in South Korea for a while, and now Huawei's payment app has been uploaded to the Play Store. </p>
<p> If you were around for yesterday's activities, you've already seen that Android Pay has been switched over to the new Google Pay branding, along with some upgrades to both the look and function. As part of the announcement, we were told that the Google Wallet app would be undergoing a short term rebranding of its own, taking on the name Google Pay Send. That version is now here, and unsurprisingly, it has been given some minor visual touch-ups. But not only that, it actually also got the reminders feature that was recently spotted in a teardown. </p>
<p> It's time for a new version of Android Messages. The latest update takes a slightly larger than average jump from v2.5 to v2.7, but no obvious changes to the UI are really popping out. However, the apk did get much smaller with this release, and there are some things visible through the lens of a teardown. We'll keep watching for other changes, but let us know if you see anything. </p>
<p> The Google Wallet app hasn't seen a lot of activity in a while, but an update began rolling out late yesterday that shows that there's still quite a bit happening to the app. Version 21 brings a number of visual enhancements that make the app look a bit cleaner and not quite as formal. Under the covers, a teardown also shows that the Wallet developers are about to launch multi-person money requests for those times when everybody splits the cost, a new reminders system to keep you from forgetting to take care of business, and confirms Android Messages integration is coming soon. </p>
<p> While Android Pay may have stolen the thunder in terms of Google's various methods of moving money from one party to another, Wallet is still up and running for those times when you've just got to move a few bucks between friends. The latest update looks basically identical to the last few versions, but a teardown of the app shows there are going to be a few changes to the security model that should reduce a little bit of friction and make the app much more convenient than it was in the past. </p>
<p> Android Pay is spreading. If you manage your finances with a big bank, chances are you can make payments by tapping your phone against a payment terminal -- yes, even if you use Chase. If you do your banking with a smaller institution, you may have to cross your fingers. </p>

<p> A new day can mean many things — freshly brewed coffee, fresh underwear (hopefully), and maybe even a fresh new case for your third-generation Pixel. Case-maker Vena has a set of wallet cases on sale for the Pixel 3 family for just $6.50 each on Amazon, after a promo code. </p>
<p> The Play Store usually gets accessories a few weeks (or more) behind the launch of any new devices. So it is with the Nexus 6: after showing up as "coming soon" about three weeks ago in the US store, the Stand Folio Case is now available for purchase, and should ship within two business days. The case can be yours for a hefty forty bucks, but it's made by the generally reliable Case-Mate, not some no-name accessory mill. </p>
<p> The Stand Folio Case does what it says on the box, so to speak: it's got a leather-style flap cover with two integrated pockets for cards or ID, and two cutouts for the stereo speakers on the Nexus 6. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/wallet-shortcut/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17550328" filename="wallet-shortcut">
<p> Evidence has surfaced that Google is working on a power menu redesign in Android 11 that accommodates smart home controls and NFC payment cards and passes. However, it looks like the company is also finally adding the latter capability to Android 10 after a few teases that hinted at the existence of the feature. First Pixel users on the stable Android 10 release report seeing their Google Pay wallet in the power menu. </p>
<p> Soon after Google released the December security patches for the Pixel phones, it followed up with a changelog detailing which new user-facing features have made it in. Among those, the company also teased a "Fix for Pixel Wallet display in power menu" in reference to the quick Google Pay shortcut seen in a beta version of Android 10. Since we never found any evidence of the functionality's availability in the stable release, we asked Google about it. That led the company to rewrite the changelog twice to finally say that it's currently an experiment that may roll out in a future update. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/08/30 9:05pm PDTon Aug 30, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/19 10:05am PDTon Sep 19, 2020. </p>
<p> LineageOS is the most popular custom ROM for Android devices, bringing new OS versions to phones and tablets that have long since been unsupported. The Pixel lineup has mostly been ignored by the project, outside of the original models, but now nearly every Google-made phone is receiving official builds of LineageOS. </p>
<p> A few things are known about the two upcoming successors to the Google Pixel and Pixel XL - we know that taimen is the largest of Google's 2017 devices, that muskie was shelved in favor of taimen and that taimen is being made by LG. However, we hadn't heard anything about specifications until now. Our friends over at XDA spoke with a source who has spent time with "at least one of these phones," and believe this information to be valid given the source's track record. </p>
<p> Based on information from three separate sources, we are now confident that Google has shelved plans to release one of its upcoming Pixel phones. The device, codenamed 'muskie,' was intended to succeed the Pixel XL. While we know very little about muskie, and now likely will never learn much else, we are confident that this phone was supposed to be the second-generation Pixel XL. </p>
<p> We rate this information 9 out of 10 on our rumor confidence scale. We have corroborated this story with several sources we deem reliable. The good news? That doesn't mean there won't be a new Pixel XL - just that it's not going to be muskie. </p>
<p> Around two weeks ago, we told you what the codenames of Google's next-generation Pixel phones are (it's muskie and walleye, if you've forgotten). After we wrote that post, a Googler commenting on the commit where walleye first appeared actually linked to our story and gave a light ribbing to the author for using unreleased device codenames in the public gerrit, which we found amusing. </p>
<p> At some point after that, though, the reference to walleye as well as the comment linking to our story were removed. If you go to the commit now, walleye is nowhere to be seen. Which, I guess that makes sense? </p>
<p> Corroborating information provided to us by a source, we can share the first public sighting of Google's next-generation Pixel phones: in the Android Open Source Project gerrit (and yes, that means it's running Android). We've only seen one of the phones - walleye - which we believe will be the smaller of Google's new Pixel devices. Muskie, the larger of the two, has not yet appeared. (For reference, last year, we only ever saw Marlin in the AOSP gerrit - there's no guarantee Muskie will ever show up there.) </p>
<p> At this point, we don't have any more information about the devices that we are yet confident enough to share. </p>

<p> wall outlet </p>
<p> You've probably seen wall outlets with built-in USB ports, but this outlet from TopGreener is pretty special. Not only does it have a USB Type-A connector, but the connector supports Qualcomm QuickCharge 3.0, and there's an additional Type-C port. The wall outlet is now $33.99 on Amazon, a $6 reduction from the original price. </p>
<p> Home security brand SkyBell makes some of the best doorbell cameras around and even featured on our holiday list of the best smart home products you can buy. It received another boost a few days ago when its doorbells were added to the Google Assistant compatibility list. Like many companies at CES 2018 in Vegas, SkyBell also had something new to show off, in the form of a camera that plugs straight into a simple wall socket. </p>
<p> Some of you might remember back in March when we took a quick look at the Top Greener USB-C wall outlet. Well, late yesterday the price over at Amazon hit an all-time low. If the idea of being able to plug your devices into a 2.4A USB-A and 3A USB-C compatible wall outlet sounds appealing, for precisely $23.96, the experience can be yours. </p>
<p> Normal wall outlets are great and all, but ones with integrated USB ports can be very handy. If you feel like breaking out the screwdriver and upgrading the plugs in your home, you can grab the Legrand/Pass & Seymour wall outlet with USB ports for $8.99 - a whopping $19 off the original price. </p>

<p> While the search engine wars haven't been particularly kind to Bing, fans of the service often praise it for updating the home page with beautiful and interesting background photos each day. It has been so popular that it has sparked a small following, and there are several wallpaper apps dedicated to pulling the images from Bing's homepage to use as wallpapers on our phones. Microsoft has even delivered the same functionality a couple times in the past with its Bing search app and a now-defunct lockscreen app; but if you don't want all of the extra weight that comes with those, Bing now has a new app dedicated to just doing wallpapers. </p>
<p> As expected, the second Android 11 Developer Preview had a few more features hidden inside it than Google let on in the initial announcement. We've covered several of the more prominent features in individual posts, but to save a bit of time, we've compiled the rest of the changes spotted (so far!) in this list. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/09/14 3:24pm PDTon Sep 14, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/25 2:05pm PDTon Oct 25, 2020. </p>
<p> Are you tired of looking at your old boring wallpaper? Google recently published 3 new collections of wallpapers to the Chrome OS Canary channel, and in my opinion: they're stunning. You can download them right now — even if you don't own a Chromebook. </p>
<p> Whether you're debating buying a Pixel 5, you've already pre-ordered, or you're not interested, there's one thing you can still get excited about: new wallpapers. A new Pixel means new artwork, and like the Pixel 4a, Google's made a whole pile of them that take advantage of that hole-punch cutout for the front-facing camera, making it a feature rather than something to be hidden, and Pixel 4a owners can use them too. </p>
<p> A good wallpaper can make a phone feel whole. It's what really ends up bringing the visual experience of a phone together. That's why wallpapers are so important, especially on devices from phone-makers like Samsung. Sometimes Samsung make mistakes, like uploading an unreleased device's firmware really early, and that lets us dig through it to find these great wallpapers. </p>
<p> While you can download the Galaxy S20 FE wallpapers right now, the Galaxy S20 FE hasn't actually been announced yet. Yesterday, Samsung announced Galaxy Unpacked for Every Fan where they are likely going to announce the Galaxy S20 FE, but at the moment nothing is official. </p>
<p> Developer and XDA forums member linuxct, who just last month ported Xiaomi's "super" wallpapers for use on other Android phones, has done it again — this time, they've exported live wallpapers from the Asus ROG Phone 3. And with a few downloads plus a little know-how, you can have them on your phone, too. </p>
<p> June is Pride Month, and as part of a broader initiative in support of LGBTQ+ people, Google has brought a little Pride flavor to its Wallpapers app. Starting today, you can deck out your phone or Chromebook in a collection of vivacious rainbow-colored backdrops — including one featuring an absolutely delightful eel. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/04 4:59am PDTon May 4, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/07 4:59am PDTon May 7, 2020. </p>
<p> Xiaomi introduced the latest iteration of its Android skin MIUI 12 last week. Along with a slew of UI and privacy improvements, the company also showed off new planet-themed "super" wallpapers. As XDA Developers reports, their forum member linuxct has already extracted three of them and made them compatible with most phones running Android 8.1 or above, including Xiaomi devices thanks to a package name change. </p>
<p> A new wallpaper is a quick and easy way to freshen up your phone. If you're a fan of OnePlus's wallpapers, you're in luck — Hampus Olsson, who designs them, has just made the three new 7T backgrounds available for download on his blog. </p>
<p> When Samsung designed its Infinity-O display, it probably didn't expect fans around the world would create amazing wallpapers to embrace the camera cutout. In fact, these were so popular they even got their own subreddit, before the company itself published a few official ones. The company is following up with this trend by releasing a bunch of new hole-punch wallpapers for the S10 and S10e featuring Disney and Pixar characters. </p>
<p> Slowly but surely, Google is embracing theming in Android. In the first Android Q beta, basic settings in the developer options allowed us to change the font, icon shape, and accent color throughout the OS. In Beta 2, icon shape selection now applies to settings app icons as well as quick settings and home screen apps. At some point in the future, it appears that a standalone Pixel Themes app will control these functions. </p>
<p> The Huawei P30 and P30 Pro were officially announced earlier this week, and some already have the phones. One of the P30's early testers has shared all the included wallpapers (and EMUI themes) with XDA Developers, so you can use them on your device of choice. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/wall-street-journal/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549144" filename="wall-street-journal">
<p> Wall Street Journal </p>
<p> Amazon is reportedly pushing back its two-day Prime Day sales event from its usual July spot to September, according to a report out of The Wall Street Journal. A previous report from Reuters back in April claimed the sale may be delayed until August, but it appears Amazon is giving itself an extra month to stock up. </p>
<p> According to a report published today by the Wall Street Journal, Samsung's next Galaxy S phone may have up to four total variants, one of which will sport a chunky 6.7"screen, six cameras, and 5G connectivity when it lands sometime next spring. In addition to that tech-toting titan, three smaller models are allegedly planned for an earlier release in February. </p>
<p> The Wall Street Journal has reported that Nintendo and DeNA are teaming up once again in order to bring us Android gamers a new title in The Legend of Zelda series. Honestly, this isn't much of a surprise seeing how well their latest Zelda game has been selling for the Wii U and Switch. </p>
<p> The Wall Street Journal has just released a new Android app called WSJ AR. It is an augmented reality app that allows you to navigate a visualization of the US stock market via your Tango phone. In addition to overall market representations, you can zoom in to look at individual stock details, view headlines related to the selected stock, and save your favorites. </p>
<p> Quite a lot of us have done away with the landline telephones that used to be a staple of homes in the developed world. A 2013 survey concluded that over 40% of US households had ditched their standard landlines phones, driven by younger users relying exclusively on their cell phones. But according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, both Google and Amazon are looking to revive the landline (well, VOIP line anyway) as a bonus feature in their voice-controlled Wi-Fi speakers, the Google Home and Amazon Echo/Tap/Echo Dot. </p>
<p> Google, for all its skill in the realms of mobile search, advertising, email, and even operating systems, has never been particularly good at the social thing. Even now, I suspect, someone at Google is fuming at the notion that the company "isn't very good" at messaging or social networks and pointing animatedly at the tens of millions of Google+ and Hangouts users. The problem is and has always been that for whatever success Google has had in social and messaging platforms, it is constantly undercut by the actions of Google itself that say otherwise. There is near-yearly reworking, redesigning, or branching off of these products in ways that very strongly suggest they aren't getting the results Google's Alphabet overlords consider acceptable. </p>
<p> Amazon's Fire Phone, the logical smartphone extension of its Kindle Fire tablet series, is a dud. A combination of lackluster reviews, carrier semi-exclusivity, and most of all being tied into Amazon's app and service environment have made it more or less a total failure. The company never publishes hard data for its hardware sales, but casual observation and constant discounts (sometimes more than $500 off of the original $650 off-contract price) imply that the product has been a wash. </p>
<p> The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Amazon isn't eager to continue in the phone market. According to the paper, "dozens" of engineers in the Lab126 hardware team have been laid off. </p>
<p> At the first few major tech conferences of the year, CES in Las Vegas, Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, and the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, the current trend of virtual reality is inescapable. Such disparate players as Facebook, Samsung, and Razer are all throwing their weight behind various virtual reality headsets, and software developers are scrambling to meet the demand for apps, games, and videos. According to this report by the Wall Street Journal, Google isn't content to dip its toe into VR with the mostly experimental Cardboard platform. </p>
<p> The paper cites "two people familiar with the project" who say that the company is working on another branch of Android specifically for virtual reality hardware and software. </p>
<p> Though the hardware was mildly refreshed back in June, Google Glass has been running on much the same internals for the better part of two years. With the rise of Android Wear, at least some of us were wondering whether Google still intended to bring its head-mounted wearable system to retail at all. According to the latest report from the Wall Street Journal, Google is indeed planning at least one more version of Glass, this time running on an Intel chipset. The new hardware will reportedly be released next year. </p>
<p> The original and current Glass models use Texas Instruments processors. </p>
<p> Samsung seems to have a big target on its back that is particularly attractive to lawyers. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, a media company focusing on photography and management is suing Samsung over its use of the "Milk" trademark for its proprietary music service. The New York- and Los Angeles-based agency alleges that Samsung knowingly and willingly violated its trademark when designing the new service. </p>
<p> Milk Studios isn't particularly well-known for everyday consumers, but it's more notable than you might think. While Milk Studios started with photography services in the 90s, it has expanded into a range of niche business-to-business media sectors, including online services, equipment rental, brick-and-mortar galleries, talent management and representation, and full production of websites, commercials, and more pertinently, music and music videos. </p>

<p> wal-mart </p>
<p> It's well into the evening now for most of the US, so presumably the bloody melee that is retail Black Friday sales is mostly over. If you've set your broken bones and patched up your bruises and you're still itching for some deals, the big box online stores are still offering discounts on MicroSD card storage, plus SanDisk's Wi-Fi-powered flash storage devices. Let's break it down by retailer, shall we? </p>
<p> Unlike some of my colleagues in the tech media, I don't have any particular beef with Walmart. Yes, they sell cheap imported crap, and yes, they under-pay their employees, stiffing both the people who make stuff and the people who sell stuff. But if you object to that strongly enough to actually change your buying habits, you'll soon run out of places to buy things. I do, however, object to the idea of a mobile payment system that works at exactly one store. That's taking the biggest problem with mobile payments as a whole, the lack of inter-operability, and turning it into a selling point. </p>
<p> I don't think anyone realized just how widespread Google's Cardboard "virtual reality" standard would become when it was first announced. And as neat as some of the games and apps that use Cardboard are, it's hard to escape the fact that the headsets are, well, made of cardboard. If you'd like something more sturdy (without having to buy a new LG phone), you can grab one of Mattel's revitalized View-Master VR toys. The original price was a bit steep at thirty bucks, but today Amazon and Wal-Mart are selling them for $19.97, a little closer to impulse buy range and pretty decent stocking-stuffers to boot. </p>
<p> Hurry up, ladies and gentlemen! If you sprint to Walmart between November 20th and 26th, you can apparently pick yourself up a very vintage Moto X running none other than Android 2.3. Those on-screen buttons and #HOLOYOLO accents look pretty spiffy on this fine Gingerbread device, don't they? </p>
<p> Curiously, on November 29th, the same phone not only drops to half price for Black Friday, it also gets a ninja upgrade to Android 4.2 and a $100 Walmart gift card (which is actually a pretty good deal since you're effectively netting 50 bucks - after signing a contract, of course). </p>
<p> The mention of "Android 2.3" also made it to the printed circulars (thanks, Stephen Scott! </p>
<p> Monster gets a bad rap from the technology community, but in all fairness, they absolutely deserve it. Between ridiculously overpriced home theater components and insanely malicious trademark lawsuits, the company is probably the most-hated technology corp this side of Electronic Arts. Having said all that, Monster announced its first Android tablet today, the 7", $149 M7. The combination of branding and price is incongruous to say the least. </p>
<p> The tablet fits pretty well into the budget 7-inch mold - you could probably guess the specs, which include a 1280x800 screen, a 1.5GHz dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM, a 5MP rear camera, and 16GB of storage plus a MicroSD card slot. </p>
<p> If you've ordered the 2013 Nexus 7 model from Best Buy, check your email - at least one Android Police staff member has received confirmation that the new tablet is ready for in-store pickup. Twitter was alight last night and this morning with some retail customers who managed to snag one off the shelves as well. Both 16GB and 32GB models are apparently being sold freely at at least some brick-and-mortar locations, at the standard $229 and $269 prices. </p>
<p> The Verge reports that at least one Wal-Mart store in Monroe, New York is selling retail units, and Amazon is offering 2-day shipping for July 30th, 1-day shipping for July 29th, and Saturday shipping for tomorrow, July 27th. </p>
<p> StraightTalk has become a popular alternative for those who don't need all the bells and whistles of flagship smartphones, or don't want the sometimes ruinous cost of keeping them connected. But even budget carriers move with the times, and the Wal-Mart partner looks like it's finally ready to embrace LTE. The Samsung Galaxy S III is now available for purchase on StraightTalk's website, and should be at your nearest Wal-Mart soon. The phone is unbranded and comes with a reasonable sticker price of $439.99 unsubsidized. </p>
<p> There's just one fly in the ointment: It's a Sprint-compatible phone. The retail packaging for the GSIII popped up on HowardForums earlier today, and the LTE-S badge in the lower corner indicates that this model runs on Sprint's CDMA-LTE network. </p>
<p> So far, the red Galaxy S III has been limited strictly to AT&T. If you wanted to get your hands on that device in the color that denotes danger and sexiness (you know, in keeping with the whole calming 'nature' theme), then two-thirds of U.S. mobile users would have to switch carriers. Now, however, you can get a red Galaxy S III 920 from Wal-Mart as long as you don't mind it being a Lumia 920, running Windows Phone, and not being a Galaxy S III at all. </p>
<p> Wait, that's not right. </p>
<p> Someone at Wal-Mart is either very confused, very stupid, or brilliant and out to make Artem's day. </p>
<p> Let's get the tough stuff out of the way up front. The T-Mobile Concord is manufactured by ZTE, runs Gingerbread, and packs a pretty meager 2MP camera. Don't worry, though. This phone shall not have been mortally wounded in vain. With a price of $99 off contract (with certain plans*) from T-Mobile or Wal-Mart, it doesn't look like too bad of a deal for smartphone users on a tight budget. If you're in the market, you can pick one of these up on August 26th. </p>
<p> While most of our readers will be entirely uninterested in a Gingerbread phone made by ZTE, it's still very interesting to note that high-speed phones are becoming available for so little money. </p>
<p> Typically, when we think about gadgets like this designed for children, Leapfrog comes to mind. Then there are the junk devices that use two-year old tech marketed as "for kids." The Nabi 2 shatters that mold, however, by using the quad-core Tegra 3 processor to power the device. That, combined with an array of fantastic and educational software, puts this tiny powerhouse in a league of its own. Best of all: it does all that for only $199. </p>
<p> After my review, many people wanted to know when this device would be available. Good news: you can now order the device from Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and Gamestop. </p>

<p> Samsung is one of the few manufacturers still making Android tablets, and the company's latest offering looks really nice. The Galaxy Tab A7 has a slim and symmetrical design, Dolby Atmos surround sound, and a plentiful 7,040mAh battery. It only launched earlier this month, but the device is already on sale for just $169.99 from Amazon and Walmart — a full $60 off. </p>
<p> If you had told me a year ago that an app primarily used for children to upload videos of themselves doing funny dances would be the center of a political storm, I'm not sure I would have believed you. The Trump administration announced last month that it planned to ban TikTok from the United States unless its ownership was divested, and just before the ban was scheduled to take effect, a judge has blocked the move. </p>
<p> Overnight, Lowes accidentally pushed up a product page for Google's upcoming Nest Audio smart speaker, confirming most of the details that already leaked (including a $99 price tag), and dropping a small pile of official images for the upcoming speaker. Seemingly not to be outdone by Lowes' accident, Walmart is already putting the speaker on shelves. </p>
<p> We do like our robot vacuum cleaners here at Android Police and we certainly are keen to review them these days. If cleaning your floor has become enough of a drain to do, you might be like us, too. Lucky for you today that iRobot's Roomba 960 is available at Walmart for $124 off current market price. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/09/01 5:11am PDTon Sep 1, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/16 8:10am PDTon Sep 16, 2020. </p>
<p> Walmart announced its new membership service Walmart+ earlier this month, and now, you can sign up for it. It's essentially Walmart's version of Amazon Prime: Members pay a yearly fee of $98 (or $12.95 per month) for unlimited free same-day deliveries, cashier-less checkouts, and fuel discounts. </p>
<p> Walmart released two tablets under its 'Onn' tech brand last year, the Onn 8 and Onn 10. We reviewed the smaller model, and for $65, it wasn't a bad device at all. Unlike Amazon's Fire tablets, which use a heavily-modified build of Android with only Amazon's own app store, the Onn 8 shipped with the Play Store and clean Android 9 Pie. </p>
<p> This year, Walmart is going for a slightly higher-end experience with its new Onn 8 Pro and Onn 10 Pro tablets. The prices have gone up a bit ($99 and $129, respectively), but in exchange, the models now offer slightly better hardware, Android 10, and USB Type-C connectivity. </p>
<p> Last year, Walmart released the surprisingly competent Onn 8 Android tablet. A year later, Walmart is launching more Onn tablets, but these are Onn Pro. How "pro" are we talking here? USB-C, Android 10, and higher screen resolutions. Calling that "pro" might be a stretch, but this is Walmart. </p>
<p> Now is the perfect time to work on those little home improvement projects you've been putting off. Whether you've been mulling over creating an entire smart-home from scratch or just looking to replace an aging device or two, there are few more dependable names in the game than Nest. Right now, you can save up to $250 during the biggest Nest sale we've seen since Black Friday. </p>
<p> Google is putting on a sale to move units of its original smart speaker, the Google Home, out from stores and into your residence. If you want or need one for any reason, you can get one from anywhere (and we mean anywhere) for half-off. </p>
<p> There are plenty of grocery delivery options out there in the time of our society's self-isolation and subsequent, exacerbated need. Some of them come from national services such as Amazon, GoPuff, Instacart, and others. But if you want to be able to get right at the source for your produce, meats, and pantry-fillers, your local store might have an app for that. </p>

<p> From a user perspective, a phone is either snappy or it's not. If it isn't, the device is either old or garbage that a manufacturer should be ashamed of shipping. </p>
<p> Looking for a tasty little news snack before the big keynote at Google I/O tomorrow? Well, you’re in luck, because it appears that Walt Mossberg over at All Things D dropped his EVO 4G review tonight. </p>
<p> The review’s fairly short…it’s almost more of a preview than a proper rundown, but I’m sure the usual suspects (Engadget, Gizmodo, MobileCrunch), will cover the device in greater detail in their reviews. Until those start popping up though, what can we glean from Mossberg’s? </p>
<p> It’s fast. Walt says the phone’s 4G capability ‘offers the highest consistent downstream data speeds I have ever seen on a cellular network.’ </p>

<p> So you have a miniature remote controlled car that you can race around with your Android phone. Big whoop. This guy built a quasi-flying capsule that he controls with his smartphone. He wins. Over and over again. But let's back up to the beginning of the story. </p>
<p> Jono Williams is a plastics engineer and graphic designer who lives in New Zealand. He wanted to build a tree house, but he struggled for months with the limitations. See, trees grow with time, they are prone to the elements and could damage whatever structure you build between or on them, and they tend to obscure the view at least from several angles. </p>
<p> Our demographics adviser tells us that there might just be five people on earth who are both regular Android Police readers and Model S owners. But if a quick scan of the office is a valid measure of interest, there's at least a few of you who are excited by the prospect of an official Tesla app, even if a longing glance is as close as we'll ever get to driving one. For you lucky devils who have an all-electric sedan sitting in your four-car garage, take a quick stroll over to the Play Store to get your companion app on. </p>
<p> WebOS may catch a lot of flack because it never really took off but it does, in fact, have some really awesome features. One feature was the card view multitasking, which has already found its way onto Android. Another cool thing it did was that wacky swipe-up-from-the-bottom launcher gesture. Well, folks, guess what there's an app for now. It's called Wave Launcher - and it's great. </p>
<p> Wave Launcher's beauty is in its simplicity, just like its WebOS predecessor. You simply touch the bottom edge of your screen and swipe up. As you swipe up, so does a bar of five or more applications for you to select. </p>

<p> warcraft </p>
<p> Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, is a pretty awesome game that combines simplicity, strategy, and luck better than any other card game I've tried. Since being introduced to it a few months ago, I have played more matches than I care to admit and, for the most part, I have thoroughly enjoyed it. That is, until recently. Over the past couple of weeks the game has gotten really stale. It seems that every day I play against the same 8-10 decks that everyone uses and that is getting kinda old. </p>
<p> The wonderful (and awful) thing about Hearthstone is that just as players are refining their decks to perfection to dominate the game, new cards are introduced that turn everything upside again. </p>
<p> Claiming to have brought the first action/real-time strategy game to Android, the developers at Maya released Legendary Heroes to the Market yesterday. The game's overall structure and style are highly reminiscent of Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a popular mod for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, meaning Legendary Heroes is almost sure to be a hit. </p>
<p> The game centers on "quick and intense matches," in which players control up to three heroes, fighting to destroy the enemy and their "source," while leveling up and gaining new abilities. Legendary Heroes promises hours of gameplay, a dynamic set of heroes - each with their own unique powers - and the ability to push characters to their potential with power ups. </p>

<p> Earlier this month Studio Wildcard announced that its hit dinosaur action-adventure game ARK: Survival Evolved would release for Android on June 14th, and as long as my eyes aren't deceiving me, it would appear that the studio has stayed true to its word. You can grab the dino adventure off of the Play Store right now. Just make sure you have a beefy device, as you will need at least 3 GB of RAM and 2.11 GB of free storage. </p>
<p> Studio Wildcard's hit dinosaur-themed survival game ARK: Survival Evolved is coming to Android this spring, and you can pre-register for the release right now on playark.com. Interestingly this upcoming on-the-go version of ARK is being designed and developed by War Drum Studios as a free-to-play release. It's supposed to closely mirror the online survival experience contained in the PC and console versions, though there will be some necessary changes with the shift in monetization, which leaves me apprehensive as to how the finished product will turn out. </p>
<p> Update: It turns out someone jumped the gun on this one, and the game isn't actually available just yet - which is why so many users are getting the "validation error." Rockstar is aware of the issue and posted a statement on their official blog: </p>
<p> We’re aware that some users have attempted to download Vice City: 10th Anniversary Edition from the Google Play Store and have experienced validation errors. Just to be clear: the game is not available for Android devices just yet, and if you’re seeing it listed on the Store then this is an error, and you shouldn’t attempt to download it. </p>

<p> We occasionally see apps pulled from the Play Store for trivial (but valid) violations of the rules. Google has been more proactive about enforcing its guidelines, but it's often pointed out it could be more consistent. Case in point: there are, right now, two listings on the Play Store from a warez site called BlackMart that offers paid apps for free. One of them has been up for months and has more than 100,000 downloads. C'mon, Google. </p>
<p> Android Pirates </p>
<p> Have you ever seen one of those annoying comments on the Android Market promising the riches and all the Android apps in the world for a low-low monthly price of $10? Sites like that pirate paid games and apps off the Market and then distribute them illegally, pocketing all the revenue. That's modern day warez at its finest. </p>
<p> Whether it was because of Android's openness or Google's notoriously poor focus on the Market, no DRM or licensing protection was available in the SDK for developers to utilize; so unless you rolled your own licensing scheme from within the app (which had a side effect of circumventing Google's payment system and therefore netted developers a whole lot more than 70% rev share), your app was easily "piratable". </p>

<p> This War of Mine is not a fun game. But it isn't trying to be. While other "realistic" war games will hand you a rifle and tell you to take that beach, Private, in This War of Mine a few scraps of meat is a much more important tool for survival. You control three survivors living in a bombed-out house in the middle of an extremely non-specific war zone, trying to scrape together enough materials to craft their way through the war without starving or freezing. </p>
<p> Warren County, Mississippi, May 19th, 1863. Battalions of Union soldiers march through the marshy ground of the delta, the wet slop already clinging to their boots. The morning chill is already passing, promising to leave a parting gift of southern humidity as the summer sun climbs over the grassland to the east. The soldiers, low on spirit but not resolve, check their rifles and equipment as they advance to the siege lines of Vicksburg. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got an arms trade simulator, an interestingly Spartan racer, and a new take on space opera from Tin Man Games. </p>
<p> For those of you too young to remember, or those just too cool to watch one of the landmark geek films of the 1980s, War Games is a movie about an artificial intelligence that plays a war game with real nuclear weapons. The humans don't know this, of course, but things get real very fast once they figure it out. The movie is a little dated now, but that doesn't stop the new official War Games puzzle game from being a blast to play. </p>

<p> As the novel coronavirus pandemic is expected to peak over the next several weeks, having the masses stay at home will be most crucial during this time. But the lockdown orders do have their deleterious domino effects from unemployment to mental deterioration. It's under these pretenses that AT&T-owned HBO has decided to offer about 500 hours of shows and movies to everyone, subscription-free. </p>
<p> Plex made its name by helping people organize and stream their media libraries, which may or may not have included pirated material. Plex also has a handful of streaming channels, but the new agreement is the biggest one yet. Plex has teamed up with Warner Bros. to stream free content to US-based users. </p>
<p> The latest Star Wars movie should arrive in theaters at the tail end of 2019, and so it makes sense that Warner Bros, LEGO, and Lucasfilm would want to capitalize on the film with a new mobile strategy game slated to arrive on the Play Store sometime in 2020. This title is called LEGO Star Wars Battles, and it's specifically designed for mobile devices to blend LEGO Star Wars characters, vehicles, and locations with real-time 1v1 multiplayer battles. </p>
<p> Westworld Mobile landed on Android a mere two days ago, and at the time pretty much everyone remarked that the game was very similar to Fallout Shelter. Turns out, it might have a bit too much in common with that game, as Bethesda is suing Warner Bros. and Behavior Interactive, the developers contracted to make Fallout Shelter for Bethesda. Apparently, WB hired Behavior to make Westworld, and Bethesda alleges some of the IP used in the recent game's creation stems from previous work on Fallout Shelter. It even has some pretty damning evidence. </p>
<p> Back in June, Warner announced a new subscription service called 'DC Universe.' It includes a wide variety of new and old video content, digital comics, and an exclusive online store. To celebrate Batman Day, which is apparently a holiday, DC Universe is out of beta and available to everyone. </p>
<p> A few months back Warner Bros. released a Westworld simulation game on the Play Store as a limited soft-launch testing release. Sadly it was region locked, which means anyone outside of the testing region was unable to play it. Well, that all changes today as Warner Bros. have just opened up their beta to the majority of Android users. Yep, that's right, there is a Westworld game available on the Play Store, and you can install it right now. </p>
<p> Jam City's upcoming RPG Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (not to be confused with Niantic's planned augmented reality Harry Potter title "Wizard's Unite") has just had a teaser trailer released that shows off a few key details of the game. It would appear that players will be creating a personalized Hogwarts student avatar to then roleplay what it would be like to attend classes, learn magical skills, and form friendships or rivalries in the Harry Potter universe. </p>
<p> All you Cardboard VR headset owners should take a quick look at Warner Bros. latest title on the Play Store. It is titled Justice League VR: Join the League, and it is a DC superhero themed minigame collection just released for the Cardboard VR platform. Each minigame has a different DC superhero as its protagonist, with a total of five games to choose from. </p>
<p> In many parts of the world, we are preparing for the most magical time of the year. What's better to go with the holiday season than a little bit of wizardry? Well, we've got you covered. The Lego Harry Potter games, both Years 1-4 and 5-7, are on sale for $0.49 each in several countries including the U.S. </p>
<p> Do you love mobile RPGs with in-app purchases? Is your love for DC characters not diminished from poor movie adaptions? Then DC Legends might just be the game for you. After appearing on the Play Store for pre-registration, the game is finally available for download. </p>

<p> WarnerMedia, and its parent company AT&T, is not the best with branding. There were once three individual HBO apps, each catering to a specific use case, but now the company is attempting to consolidate them across all platforms. </p>
<p> WarnerMedia has finally launched its new streaming platform HBO Max today, joining the other online entertainment services under the AT&T umbrella. The service comes with a number of original series on top of the content already available through the other HBO channels, like Game of Thrones, Westworld, Loony Toons, and DC Universe content. The US-exclusive service is free for HBO subscribers and will cost $14.99 a month for everyone else, with an option for a free seven-day trial. </p>
<p> HBO Max is set for a May 27 debut and the rush is on for WarnerMedia to get as many people on board as possible. With AT&T as its owner, that means giving away free access and extended free trials for its wireless, broadband, and TV customers. For the outsiders, though, they can get an introductory rate for their first year. </p>

<p> Spotify's launch in India has been a long time coming. It's nearly inconceivable that the music streaming giant hasn't yet put its foot in one of the world's largest markets and tried to grab millions of subscribers. But after years of waiting, we're almost there: following recent rumors of Spotify's India launch, the app is now available on the Play Store in India and signing up with an account is possible, even if buying a Premium subscription isn't working smoothly yet. </p>
<p> On the eve of I/O, Google managed to finalize deals with Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment to bring a music subscription service to both YouTube and Google Play, according to a report by The Verge that is now being corroborated by The Wall Street Journal. If everything goes smoothly, a preview or launch of the new service tomorrow isn't out of the question. The Journal similarly says the streaming solution could launch "as soon as this week." That would give Google a substantial leg up over Apple, which is still in the process of negotiating contracts for its own music streaming solution. </p>

<p> Web services company Cloudflare has been working for 2 years on a faster mobile VPN. Yesterday it finally took the wraps off some of the tricks it has implemented to speed up connections with distant servers while still providing encryption and virtual relocation to end users. That work is now debuting in the 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver app, with the introduction of the free Warp VPN. </p>
<p> A couple of days ago, Google fulfilled its obligation to prevent me from sleeping by releasing a stack of newly updated apps for me to examine. Some of them were pretty straight forward, like the latest version of Android Device Manager, and others turned out to be pretty mind-boggling. That's how the YouTube update turned out. The apk grew by 2 MB, and Google certainly packed in quite a bit, but many of the additions don't make much sense. To be fair, we've already seen Google isn't opposed to throwing in a few pranks of its own, but most of the new code and resources are too elaborate for a simple joke. </p>

<p> Warp Charge </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/07 8:10am PDTon May 7, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/15 7:25am PDTon Jun 15, 2020. </p>
<p> Recent OnePlus phones have been all about speed — from snappy performance to speedy charging tech. The company is so absorbed by this notion that it waited a long while before introducing wireless charging to make sure its implementation lived up to its high standards. The company's Warp Charge, previously Dash Charge, has been among the industry’s fastest charging solutions, but OnePlus doesn’t want to settle there and seems to be kicking things a notch higher with an even faster charging speed. </p>
<p> Leaks have already indicated that the OnePlus 8 Pro will support wireless charging (though the smaller 8 probably won't), and today the company has revealed some of the specs behind its wireless charging solution. The new Warp Charge 30 Wireless spits 30W — that's the same power as OnePlus' wired Warp Charge. If it works as advertised and doesn't get too toasty, that means similar charging speeds whether you prefer a cable or a stand. </p>
<p> There's plenty of hype for the OnePlus 8 series as we come within two weeks of its supposed launch. However, as any hero needs a sidekick, we're told to expect two of them with that flagship phone — new OnePlus Bullets Wireless earbuds and a 30W wireless charging pad. </p>
<p> Earlier today, smartphone maker Oppo announced three new charging technologies it plans on using in upcoming products: a 30W VOOC 4.0, Wireless VOOC Flash Charge at 30W, and a tremendous 65W SuperVOOC 2.0. If history is any indicator, we'll probably see them licensed to companies like OnePlus for even faster "Warp" charging in the future. </p>
<p> So, you've bought your OnePlus 7 Pro. What now? Is it time to accessorize? Well, if you didn't decide to on purchase, you can do so today with T-Mobile — most cables and adapters for the new phone are 25% off. And if you've decided to pick up a OnePlus 6T, you can get a Karbon Bumper Case for more than half off. </p>
<p> OnePlus' Warp Charge standard pushes up to 30W to the company's latest 7 Pro, delivering 50% more power compared to the previous 20W Dash Charging system. And although OnePlus has decided to charge $5 more for Warp Charge cables, the older, cheaper Dash-compatible cables work just as well according to both a OnePlus product manager and our own tests. </p>
<p> The folks over at the Dutch site Mobielkopen have spotted a trademark application in the EU for "Warp Charge," filed on behalf of OnePlus. Presumably, this new name is set to replace Dash Charge, after OnePlus previously failed to secure it as an exclusive trademark in the EU. </p>

<p> The biggest splash you'll see about power management on the OnePlus 8 Pro is that you'll be able to use its complementary Warp Charge 30 Wireless charger to pump a whopping 30 watts without the need for a cable. That said, you'll still be able to charge the 8 Pro wirelessly with pretty much any Qi charging pad and have the pad charge other phones via Qi, too. </p>

<p> warranty </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/16 9:29am PDTon Apr 16, 2020 and last updated 2020/04/22 1:28am PDTon Apr 22, 2020. </p>
<p> In a fragile time when the world is under a pandemic and the least common denominator in corporate marketing campaigns is "we're all in this together," there are still ways where companies can compete and advertise their efforts. HMD Global, for example, has made a goodwill gesture towards its customers by extending the warranties for some Nokia phones. </p>
<p> Like many other countries, all of India is currently under lockdown. There are only a few exceptions from this rule, and going to a Samsung shop to get your device fixed is not among the legit reasons to leave your home —in fact, all Samsung stores are currently closed. The Korean company recognizes this situation and offers extended service for devices that would've seen the end of their warranty during the lockdown period. It's also possible to pick up a pre-booked Galaxy S20 at a later time. </p>
<p> Most companies have been putting out statements to assure customers during the coronavirus pandemic, and OnePlus is no exception. Following up on a post published last week, the company has just announced that it is extending warranty coverage and return periods to make things a little easier for customers. It's also working on a "back-up device program" that lets you apply for a loaner device while your own undergoes repairs. </p>
<p> Moshi aims to produce premium, long-lasting accessories for mobile devices, and most of the time, the company succeeds — many of its products we've reviewed over the years have proved to be well worth their money. During CES 2020, the manufacturer has made clear that it believes in the quality of its electronics by introducing a free 10-year global warranty. </p>
<p> Here in the US, Google has had its own mail-in repair center set up for Pixel phones for around eight months. In the rest of the world, though, Google offers nothing of the sort, instead pointing customers to recommended walk-in and mail-in service centers via a support page. These support pages have just been updated, indicating that official mail-in services will soon be offered in a number of European countries. </p>
<p> The Federal Trade Commission released a statement today saying it's sent warning letters to several major companies in the US reminding them that it's illegal to stipulate warranty coverage is dependent on using prescribed parts and service providers for repairs. In addition to manufacturers of "cellular devices," warnings were also sent to companies that sell cars and video game hardware. </p>
<p> By now, all of you are familiar with the issues people are having with the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, namely with the display. Google's VP of Product Management, Mario Queiroz, has just issued a statement saying that all Pixel 2 phones will be upgraded to two-year warranties for added peace of mind. </p>
<p> The Nexus 6P is one of those phones that had high initial quality, but it hasn't withstood the test of time very well. This phone has been plagued by battery issues that cause it to randomly shut off. Those who bought their phones from the Google Store have reported success not only with getting the phone replaced, but replaced with a Pixel XL. </p>
<p> Let's face it - LG phones have had problems with long-term use in the past. Many former phones from the company experienced the famous bootloop issue, which plagued the G4, Nexus 5X, G5, V10, and others. This was especially a problem for phones outside the warranty period. LG wants you to know that it's confident in the G6's longevity, and as a result, the company has extended the phones' warranty period to two years. </p>
<p> Buying a used phone is something of a crapshoot. Customers can do all the research they like or pore over photos with a magnifying glass, but eventually they just have to trust that someone else hasn't dumped a lemon of a device onto the next sucker. Swappa, a marketplace for gadget buyers and sellers that specializes in Android hardware, is trying to take some of the uncertainty out of that process. Starting today the company is offering device protection plans for phones, with laptops and tablets coming soon. </p>

<p> NVIDIA has been serving up Android-based hardware for years now, but the SHIELD Android TV Box lets you play games and access the broader Android TV ecosystem from one device. And just as you would expect from NVIDIA, the SHIELD is no slouch when it comes to gaming performance and selection. What you might not know is how great the selection of games you can play on SHIELD is. Here are some of the best. </p>
<p> One of the titles you won’t want to miss is Portal, the instant classic in which you must deal with GLaDOS to teleport your way out of each level. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got several PC and console pilgrims including Hotline Miami, War Thunder, and Always Sometimes Monsters, a new Portal-inspired Zen Pinball table, a mashup of tactic, RPG, and city-building, and standard platformers and puzzlers. </p>
<p> NVIDIA just announced its second SHIELD device, the SHIELD Tablet. You can read all about it in the main post, but every gamer knows that a new device is nothing without games to play on it. NVIDIA has focused its efforts on bringing full-sized PC and console games like Mount & Blade, Portal, and Half-Life 2 to the SHIELD Portable, but with the Tablet, they've set their sights on current-generation titles. Here are a few that we know about before the SHIELD Tablet launch on July 29th. </p>

<p> Commuters in the Evergreen State have a new option for getting around: Waze Carpool is now available in Washington. Waze says it chose Washington as its new location for the program largely because the state already has a large number of Waze users, with more than 375,000 in Seattle alone. </p>
<p> As the Thanksgiving weekend is coming to an end, residents of Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Miami, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus can say thank you to Sprint today as well. The nation's 3rd largest mobile carrier announced that 4G, otherwise known as WiMax, is officially live in the aforementioned cities. This puts the Los Angeles area full 2 days ahead of schedule, as the 4G launch there was expected on December 1st. SF Bay Area next, please (the launch there is expected sometime in December)! </p>

<p> I'm generally of the opinion that we shouldn't given attention to those who are seeking it for the wrong reasons or under false pretenses, but I just couldn't ignore this story: Escobar Inc. (yes, that Escobar) is now telling consumers that it will sell a very-much-not-a-counterfeit Galaxy Fold for the low, low price of $400. </p>
<p> Let us be clear from the outset: the product pictured on the company's website is very clearly a real, genuine Samsung Galaxy fold covered in a tacky gold vinyl skin with Escobar Inc's logos haphazardly slapped upon it. Let us also be clear that the phone's specs, like the Snapdragon 855 processor, 5 cameras, 7.3" AMOLED primary display, and most others are lifted straight from the Galaxy Fold. </p>
<p> It turns out that the folding phone isn't the only weird form factor these days. Andy Rubin, the man behind Essential, just posted the first photos of the company's upcoming phone on Twitter. It's quite the departure from the PH-1, but if you like how tall Sony's 21:9 phones are, you're in for a real treat. </p>
<p> We're pretty big fans of the C by GE bulb line here at Android Police, given the features, Assistant integration, and excellent price point. Although we pointed it out how tedious the reset process for the smartbulbs was in our reviews, the official video by GE Lighting describing the process is currently making the rounds, and it's pretty funny. </p>
<p> After a beta program with bizarrely strict requirements for entry earlier this year, an update to Android 8.0 Oreo is now available for the ZTE Axon 7 — with more than one catch. The update isn't being pushed over the air, but rather has to be installed from an SD card, and it'll wipe your device. </p>
<p> Okay, we always get a little excited when a new app from Google Inc. appears in the Play Store. Tonight, Google's pushed an app called Interactive Events up, but we're not quite sure what it's for yet. According to Google: </p>
<p> The Google Interactive Events App provides agenda details and speaker bios for managed events. </p>
<p> But it's not exactly clear to us what managed events the app is meant to handle. </p>
<p> There are very specific applications and implementations that make sense on Google's smartwatch platform. Minecraft isn't one of them. Even so, the first batch of Android Wear devices have at least as much processing power and memory as some of the older or cheaper smartphones, so it was only a matter of time before someone tried something like this. That someone is YouTube user and Galaxy Gear owner Corbin Davenport. </p>
<p> Corbin says that he didn't do anything special to get Minecraft: Pocket Edition running on his Gear Live, just manually installed it (I'm assuming he used the standard ADB commands). Since the Gear Live uses a Snapdragon 400 processor running at 1.2Ghz, with half a gigabyte of RAM and 4GB of storage, it's got more than enough oomph to play the ubiquitous building game, though I'm betting that it's only working in local mode. </p>
<p> Earlier this month LG let the G3 Stylus slip out in an ad, though at the time we weren't exactly sure what the device was. Now we know, because LG made it official. Spoiler: it's not as cool as you hoped. I promise. </p>
<p> So the G3 Stylus looks like a G3 with a stylus, and it packs some of the features that makes the G3 cool, but it's not a G3 with a stylus. It's some weak device running around in a G3's clothes. I bet the G3 will be pissed when it finds out something has been raiding its closet. </p>
<p> Intel might have finally cracked the video messaging code. See, you'd probably send more video messages to people if you looked like a giant anthropomorphized puffer fish. Heck, you might even pay for the privilege of looking like George Washington in said video message. So obviously, there's now an Intel app called Pocket Avatars that does just that. </p>
<p> Hey, Minus, are you guys alright? Because you're demonstrating the developer equivalent of multiple personality disorder. Sixteen months after Dropbox-style cloud storage app Minus shifted 180 degrees to take aim at Instagram, it has once again become a completely different service, this time with a new name. Minus is now "Meow," a randomized chat client, sort of like Omegle or Chatroulette without the video. All that's left of the latest Minus re-brand, or indeed the original storage app, is the "com.minus.android" APK name. </p>
<p> There isn't much to Meow. It works as a standard all-in-one chat client a la WhatsApp and its army of clones, with a contact list sourced from Gmail and Facebook. </p>

<p> Back in March, Chinese manufacturer Oppo announced its first smartwatch, sporting a design similar to the one of an Apple Watch. The device, called the Oppo Watch, was exclusively meant to be sold on the Chinese Market and ran an in-house Android-based OS. However, a new promotional video seems to point the company is about to release a refreshed version of the product that will ship with Wear OS. </p>
<p> Samsung's smartwatches are one of the better choices when it comes to the Android side of wearables. The company released its Gear S3 watch back in 2016 to solid reviews, and it has kept owners on their feet with new updates since then. Last year, the S3 received an update to Samsung's One UI, and now it looks like a new update, System Update 7, is rolling out. </p>
<p> Samsung has been working on adding blood pressure measurements to its wearables for a while. It launched a limited test of that feature for the original Watch Active back in 2019, and now, about a year later, the company has announced that the South Korean government has authorized its brand-new Health Monitor app. It's capable of taking blood pressure with nothing but the Watch Active2 (plus some calibration help from a traditional cuff) and will be available in the country in the third quarter of 2020. </p>
<p> Wyze detailed the timeline of its upcoming smart home products last week, including the Wyze Band—a wearable that functions as a fitness tracker as well as allowing you to control your Wyze products from your wrist in the form-factor of the Fitbit Charge 3. Now, additional details have come to light thanks to some information in the public beta app. </p>
<p> Google's Wear OS platform is in a bit of a weird place. The operating system itself is still being periodically updated with new features and improvements, like the Tiles function that was released in May, but the third-party app library is still minimal, and Qualcomm has been slow to improve the underlying hardware. Still, Wear OS isn't going anywhere, and the closest thing to a flagship watch is the new fifth-generation Fossil Q lineup. </p>
<p> The Fossil Gen 5 is currently one of the best Wear OS smartwatches you can get if you want to invest in Google's vision for wearables. Only about three months after the initial release, it's already heavily discounted on Amazon. You can save $90 on the Carlyle Stainless Steel and the more feminine Julianna Stainless Steel variants of the watch as they're down to just $205. </p>
<p> Hybrid smartwatches are so hot right now. If Fossil's latest entry into the product category doesn't excite you, perhaps a similar model from Withings will - especially since it's on sale for $60 below the regular price. </p>
<p> Wear OS smartwatches are seen as sub-par compared to the competition, mainly because most of them still use outdated processors or lack key features. With the TicWatch Pro, Mobvoi managed to design one of the most attractive intelligent timepieces powered by Google's OS on the market. However, despite its good selling points, the product lacked LTE connectivity, which prevented owners from using all their watch's features on the go. </p>
<p> Samsung unveiled its latest mainstream smartwatch, the simply-named Galaxy Watch, late last year. It was a decent wearable, but fairly pricey at the time ($300), and it lacked MST support in Samsung Pay. </p>
<p> The newer health-focused Galaxy Watch Active was announced alongside the Galaxy S10, and it's definitely a more attractive wearable for most people. It's less expensive and physically smaller, while retaining excellent battery life. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Watch Active is one of the best smartwatches you can buy right now, but Samsung definitely cut a few corners — including dropping one of Tizen's best features. </p>

<p> There's no denying that Apple makes the best all-around smartwatches, especially if you care about fitness, so Android-compatible watches continue to battle for second place. The most recent entry from the Wear OS camp is the fifth-gen Fossil Q, and while that watch is a decent step up from every other device with the same software, it still hasn't addressed some of the platform's core problems — poor fitness tracking, degrading app library, and so on. </p>
<p> Samsung's new watch is a follow-up to the Galaxy Watch Active, which was (by most accounts) the best overall smartwatch for Android devices. </p>
<p> Samsung just posted a teaser video appearing to (barely) show off both the previously-leaked Tab S6 and Watch Active 2 — assuming those end up being the final names. If super-close panning shots of edges and extreme angles aren't quite your thing, there is one pertinent bit of actual information: A pair of dates stating when the devices will be "digitally unveiled." </p>

<p> The Galaxy Watch Active2 included hardware support for Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring when it was released late last year, as did this year's Galaxy Watch3. The feature couldn't be enabled in the United States until it received FDA approval, leading to one of the watches' main selling points not (officially) working in America. At long last, Samsung has received the FDA's blessing, and ECG support is rolling out to both models. </p>
<p> Samsung makes some of the best Android-compatible smartwatches around. Last year the company released the Watch Active, a smaller sports-focused watch, and followed it up a few months later with the Active2. Both watches are still excellent, and now they're heavily discounted at multiple retailers. </p>

<p> "The Beeb on your wrist" might be mistaken for Cockney slang by some poorly-travelled American blogger, but in this case it's the latest feature to hit the official BBC Worldwide news app. The update to 3.2 for BBC News UK and BBC News Worldwide will send short snippets of stories to your Android Wear device. The only other changes are bug fixes and some layout adjustments for the primary, non-wearable app. </p>
<p> The Pebble Smartwatch's utility was somewhat limited when it launched, thanks to an API that only supported notifications and data going from your phone to the watch, not the other way around. The last update to the API fixed that, and now Pebble has at least some degree of control over a connected phone. Pebble Phone Ringer Switcher from noted developer Faruq Rasid is the first Pebble app we've seen take advantage of this, at least on the Play Store. </p>

<p> watch band </p>
<p> Smartwatches aren't for everyone, but for many (including myself), they can be incredibly helpful at times. But just because a smartwatch is a piece of technology, doesn't mean it can't look nice. Several companies have been selling custom bands for smartwatches over the years, and perhaps the best in the industry is Clockwork Synergy. </p>
<p> This time (pun intended), we have partnered with Clockwork Synergy to give away eight packs of the company's watchbands. </p>
<p> A couple months back Motorola announced that Moto 360 straps made in partnership with DODOcase, the makers of some rather impressive premium cases, were on the way. Now they're here. The accessory is available for purchase over at Motorola.com. </p>
<p> Like anything concerning the Moto 360, DODO leather bands don't come cheap. These wrist holders will set you back $59.99 a pop. </p>
<p> The DODO strap is available in four colors: blue, green, red, and tan. There are no black or gray bands here, probably because they would look too similar to the Moto 360's existing leather straps (which go for $29.99) to be necessary. </p>
<p> At the $249.99, you can still get the stainless steel or black watches with 22mm bands in "stone" or black, respectively. The new metal options cost $299 for 23mm black or stainless bands matched to the watch, and they're both shipping now. </p>
<p> Update: As commenter JT3 points out, it looks like all the new color options introduced today aren't shipping for at least a month, despite being sold immediately. That includes the separate metal bands. Bummer. </p>
<p> Update 2: ...aaaaand they're gone. The new colors and band listings have been removed from Amazon, presumably to be added back at some point. At least you can drool at the photos below between now and then. </p>
<p> We saw the possibilities pop up before, but it looks like Amazon is now officially selling the Moto 360 smartwatch in more colors and with alternate bands. Before today you could get the Android Wear device with a stainless steel or black finish, with black, grey, or "stone grey" bands. </p>

<p> Back in March, Chinese manufacturer Oppo announced its first smartwatch, sporting a design similar to the one of an Apple Watch. The device, called the Oppo Watch, was exclusively meant to be sold on the Chinese Market and ran an in-house Android-based OS. However, a new promotional video seems to point the company is about to release a refreshed version of the product that will ship with Wear OS. </p>
<p> Mobvoi is one of the few companies still taking the future of Wear OS seriously and releasing new hardware. But today Mobvoi has a deal reaching into the past. The company's 2018 flagship smartwatch, the TicWatch Pro, is available on Amazon for just $139.99, a savings of $60 off recent prices. </p>
<p> Fossil makes some of the most handsome Wear OS devices around, with simple, relatively traditional styling. From right now through the end of the week, many of their latest watches are on sale for $199. Depending on which you're interested in, that's a savings of up to $76. </p>
<p> Casio's Pro Trek line of smart watches started in 2016 with the WSD-F10, a bulky, expensive Android Wear device with aesthetics and a feature set slanted at the outdoorsy market. The company followed up in 2017 with the WSD-F20, a refinement on the concept. Now, Casio is back at it with the WSD-F30, which is less chunky, but still rugged (and expensive). </p>
<p> Documentation concerning a new Wear OS watch manufactured by LG has appeared on the Federal Communication Commission's website. The listing doesn't reveal a whole lot, but the watch is described as a "portable wrist device" with a model number of LM-W315. It's possible the filing is for LG's rumored "hybrid" watch that's said to feature both physical hands and an LCD display. </p>
<p> I've been here at Android Police for over a year, now, fighting my way up the ranks and RSS feeds. So far I've succeeded, and having the opportunity to spend my days writing about technology has been incredible. As a result of that, I've accrued a ton of hardware and software, much of which has become an integral part of my workflow and life. </p>
<p> So here's a peek at all the stuff, personal and professional, that lets me do me. </p>
<p> Android Wear is entering a potentially critical time. Wear 2.0 hasn't been received nearly as well as might have been expected, with many observers understandably worrying for its future. Watches were conspicuously absent from Google's big hardware event last week, and the Google Store site refresh has removed all non-Google products, including LG's recently released Android Wear watches. </p>
<p> Wear fans could use some more good news to add to the recent announcement of the Oreo beta program for the LG Watch Sport, and it looks as though we have exactly that. Googler Hoi Lam took to Google+ yesterday to share some new information about future updates to Android Wear 2.0. </p>
<p> About a year and a half ago, Corning first announced Project Phire, a hybrid between Gorilla Glass and sapphire. The project aimed to bring Gorilla Glass's drop protection and sapphire's extreme scratch resistance together to create an extremely durable display glass. Now, the company has introduced Gorilla Glass SR+, the result of Project Phire's research, for wearable use. </p>
<p> The first few Android Wear watches from mid-2014 were watches in name only. They were really more like tiny screens strapped to your wrist that told the time. The design of Android Wear devices has evolved significantly since then, and now there are some that look like honest-to-goodness watches. The second gen Moto 360 and Huawei Watch are the most watch-like so far, but they aren't cheap. Let's see how they compare so you can (maybe) pick up the right one for you. </p>
<p> According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is working on a few things. They are, according to the world's most infamous tipster "People Familiar With The Matter," working on an Android-powered video game console. And a smart watch. And a new Nexus Q. And the possibility of Android-powered appliances (like refrigerators). And Laptops. And, oh yeah, low-cost phones for developing markets. </p>
<p> Typically we avoid reporting on too-good-to-be-true rumors, but today's alleged revelation is a real whopper. Since it comes from the Wall Street Journal – which often comes through on rumors – it might just be worth keeping an eye on. </p>

<p> If you pay for cable, you probably pay for ESPN. Disney's sports empire is practically inescapable, especially if you watch college sports, and it's essentially impossible to pay for conventional television without getting ESPN thrown into the package, whether you want it or not. So if you're paying for it, you might as well get it on your phone too, right? ESPN's live streaming service WatchESPN is now available within the primary ESPN app itself. Previously WatchESPN was a separate Android app. </p>
<p> Update: Anime provider Crunchyroll has gained Chromecast support as well. </p>
<p> The 2014 FIFA World Cup will start next week, making this just the right time for WatchESPN and MLS Matchday to roll out their new ability to stream matches straight to Chromecast. You still need a cable subscription to enjoy any of the content, but the feature prevents having to reach for the TV remote and navigate that troublesome guide for the correct channel. Just fire up that app and poke that touchscreen the way we Android fans just can't get enough of. </p>
<p> Those of you who are lucky enough to attend the game in person can rest assured knowing that when you get back, Google+ Photos is now ready to let you toss up those photos and recordings you took up onto the big screen as well. </p>
<p> Are you an AT&T U-verse customer who's been chomping at the bit to get your hands (or eyes, rather) on some sports action while on-the-go? Today's your lucky day – AT&T and ESPN just announced support for the WatchESPN app for qualifying U-verse customers. And by "qualifying" they mean "customers who actually have ESPN as part of their package." So, that should be pretty much everyone, right? </p>
<p> Either way, the app is free so you can hit up the Play Store to grab it, enter your U-verse login credentials, and away you go. Just in time for the NBA Playoffs, too. </p>
<p> If you love ESPN but are angry because Comcast won't let you watch it on your phone through the WatchESPN app, your luck just changed. The most recent update to the app fixes that exact issue: it now allows Comcast customers who get ESPN as part of the TV package watch the channel on their smartphone or tablet. </p>
<p> That's really the only major difference with this update - aside from the always-included bug fixes, of course. If you already have the app installed, you can pull the update now. But, if you're a Comcast customer who uninstalled it in a fit of rage after realizing that it was basically worthless to you, hit the widget below. </p>

<p> With the advent of the fitness-focused wearable, everyone suddenly became a lot more conscious of their health. Fitbit introduced blood oxygen saturation monitoring for many of its existing smartwatches earlier this year, and now the company is giving customers a new watch face to easily check SpO2 levels at a glance. </p>
<p> Customizable watch faces are an integral part of the smartwatch experience. What good is a digital display if you're not going to use it to make your watch look exactly like you want it to? That's why there are hundreds of designers making faces for every wearable platform, and apps such as Pujie Black that let you create your own. The popular app was previously restricted to Wear OS but is now also compatible with Tizen OS, namely Samsung's Galaxy Watch, Watch Active, and Gear Sport. Support for the Gear S3 is coming soon. </p>
<p> It may be the silliest idea to some, but it may be the most interesting idea to others. Wearable Widgets, an app that transforms your phone's widgets into Wear OS (né Android Wear) watch faces, has added support for complications. So instead of replacing your entire watch face with a widget, you can leave whichever design you like and choose a widget from your phone as a complication inside it. How well does it work? I tested it to find out. </p>
<p> Udell is a well-known Android developer, mostly thanks to Wearable Widgets. If you're getting ready for Google I/O 2018, or you're just looking for a fun Android Wear Wear OS watch face, Udell's new 'I/O 2018 Watch Face' is pretty great. </p>
<p> What's time but a series of building blocks of infinitesimally small moments? You change one block and the whole structure could be modified, you add and add and add more blocks, hoping the final result is beautiful and meaningful, and you look around at others' structures learning from them and sometimes envying or criticizing them. That's one philosophical way of introducing this new watch face by Tha PHLASH, Timecraft. </p>
<p> Like its name and all of the screenshots here suggest, Timecraft is inspired by Minecraft. The signature blocky design is there, the green and grey/brown colors are present as well, and although I've never actively played the game or got lost in its world, I can easily spot the similarities based on what little I've seen from it. </p>
<p> Out of all the watch maker applications on Android, Pujie Black is my favorite. I find the interface easier than WatchMaker, plus it's accessible on Android instead of requiring a web browser like Facer. I also love that I paid once for the app and I can get all of the community's creations for free and edit them to fit my personal needs. There's a learning curve to figuring out what everything does inside the app, but once you've got the hang of it, there are hundreds of things you can change to specifically tailor it to your preference. I personally like seeing my steps, the date, and PST timing (Artem's timezone) as the 3 Pujie indicators, and I love having a tap action to play/pause Pocket Casts specifically. </p>
<p> In the most recent update to the Huawei Watch, the company added a brand-new customizable face to the device. While you may note that there are plenty of watch face creation apps out there for Android Wear, Huawei's is a bit different. All of the customization happens on the watch itself, and the UI is dead simple - just pick and choose the elements you want, and you're off with a personalized layout. </p>
<p> While it's not the most robust customization we've seen for Android Wear, the simplicity and functionality of Huawei's tool is what really makes it shine. Anybody can figure this out, and it allows you to add just a touch of personal flare to your smartwatch if you find the built-in faces don't really suit you. </p>
<p> It's been a while since we've seen a true update to Google Fit – about 6 months if you don't count a version that turned up in the final M Developer Preview. You might even say the app got a bit flabby over the summer. (Sorry.) The latest version began rolling out yesterday and it's featuring a couple of big changes for Android Wear, including a brand new watch face and a trainer mode to help you get in shape. The main app also went through a couple of changes, but they're nothing to get excited about. However, check back later for a pretty big teardown – some big things are happening. </p>
<p> One of the best things about smartwatches is that they finally give the fashion-inclined the ability to switch out watch faces without buying another $300 bit of wrist jewelry. There have been attempts to create systems whereby end users could easily create their own digital watch faces ever since the original Pebble, with varrying degrees of success. Now Asus, which has already released dozens of custom watch faces for its ZenWatch and ZenWatch 2 customers, has created its own custom watch face maker app. </p>
<p> ZenWatch FaceDesigner, in addition to being number one with a bullet on the Most Wanted list for camelcase offenders, offers Asus smartwatch users a way to quickly and easily make and install customized watch faces for the ZenWatch. </p>
<p> We've known that it's coming for about a month, and today Google has made good on those expectations. According to a post on the official Android blog, Android Wear will be getting a software update "in the coming weeks" that will enable interactive watch faces. These are essentially tiny apps/widgets built into a watch face design that let you do more than simply tell the time or check the weather. A sufficiently advanced face app could replace several individual Wear apps, or do away with the need to check for updates from a specific app. </p>
<p> Here are some of the examples Google gives in its post. </p>

<p> Ever looked at your smartwatch and wished there were real LEDs inside that lit up and turned off to tell you the time? Ever checked all those Android Wear watchfaces and wanted them to feel a little more vibrant and a little less dull? Well, here you go, you'll love Real LED Watchface. </p>
<p> The watchface's interface is based on 3D renders of LEDs and the developer says it achieves "photorealistic light, reflections, and shadows." I've been using it for half an hour and I tend to agree: it looks quite real and just as good as the screenshots. Aside from the lights, the face is very straightforward: the big LED is for the hours, the small one is for the minutes, and the super small LEDs in the center light up with the seconds. </p>

<p> Alternate title: When Artem Asks You To Write A "Fun" Post, You Accept The Challenge And Do Your Best </p>
<p> The latest beta update for Microsoft's OneDrive cloud storage service includes two significant feature additions. The first is the presence of a watchface for your Android Wear device and the other headliner is a built-in PDF viewer, which is well overdue since competitors Google Drive and Dropbox have had the function for quite a while now. </p>
<p> I have to say I was pretty surprised to get a notification after updating the app that told me to try out the OneDrive watchface. As you can see on the screenshot above, Microsoft says I can use it to see my photos on my watch. </p>
<p> How many times have you looked at your Android Wear watch while it booted and thought, "Gosh darn it, that's a rrrrreally cool animation right there!" If you love that boot sequence, you probably get a tickle every time your battery dies or your watch updates and you see it starting up again. Boot Watch Face eliminates those requirements by using the animation each time you turn your watch on. Neat! </p>
<p> The super zen video above shows you everything you should expect from Boot Watch Face. It's very customizable with options to pick the clock hands colors and background (there's a cool "randomize" option too), change the needles' thickness (only when the watch is on — the ambient needles are very thin for my taste), remove the seconds ticker, and speed up the animation. </p>

<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Wear OS faces that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous three months or so. Typically AP includes apps in our Wear OS roundups, but sadly I don't have any to share this time around. This means today's roundup will specifically highlight a bunch of new watch faces, and since I have so many to share I've split the list into two separate pages for easier consumption. You can expect to find the flashier faces on the first page, and the more traditional designs are located on the second page. </p>
<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Wear OS apps and faces that went live on the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous six months or so. Since our last collection, Google has changed the branding from Android Wear to Wear OS, and there are finally devices in the market that contain the new Snapdragon 3100 chip, which allows for more features, such as a visible second hand when the ambient mode is on. While I'm sure the progress of Wear OS isn't moving as fast as enthusiasts would like, there's no arguing the platform isn't dead yet. </p>
<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Wear OS apps and faces that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous seven months or so. It's been a slow process cataloging each Wear release since February, but I think we finally have enough to push out another roundup of the best Wear OS has to offer. </p>
<p> A day or two of uptime for a smartwatch is accepted as the norm these days — a sad state of affairs, indeed. So when a nifty feature is introduced, excitement is immediately doused with the reality that it almost certainly means conceding some already-scanty battery life. Facer recently announced watch face games for Wear OS and Tizen smartwatches, and they seem like a clever take on uber-casual gaming worth your while if you're fine keeping that charger nearby. </p>
<p> Don’t you wish your favorite Wear OS watch face could do more? Thanks to a huge new Facer update, it can! </p>
<p> Facer 4.6.0 adds support for interactive watch faces for the first time, giving users the ability to launch apps, play mini-games, trigger fun animations, and lots more right from their wrist. </p>
<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Android Wear faces that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous 3 months or so. </p>
<p> With Christmas right around the corner, I thought it would be prudent to put together a list of apps, games, live wallpapers, and watch faces that are appropriately holiday-themed. There are a total of 15 Play Store listings within this list, and each one has been hand-picked. So if you are looking for some great Android-specific apps with a Christmas theme, you have clicked on the right listicle. </p>

<p> It's getting harder to do something new with Android Wear watch faces, but that doesn't mean you can't improve on what's already been done. Case in point: the new Task Master watch face shows calendar appointments on your wearable, but it does so better than other watch faces. It's even usable if you've got a lot of calendar appointments to track. </p>

<p> Fans of Android Wear have plenty to be excited about. A major update was just announced during the Google I/O 2016 keynote with many of the features users have been looking forward to. The headlining additions to the platform focus largely on more advanced watchfaces, improvements for messaging, and expanded integration and more automatic use of the Google Fit platform. A Preview program is also being launched for Wear, so developers will be able to work on new apps for the platform before official rollouts begin. </p>
<p> If you want a quick overview of what's new, watch our Wear 2.0 hands-on video. </p>
<p> So Facer is now trying to grab more users and entice everyone to join its platform by lowering the entry barrier — and also seemingly planning an iOS launch for the Apple Watch. </p>

<p> With Google I/O 2019 in full swing this past week, we sure expected to hear tons about Google's upcoming projects — and so we very much did — but weren't exactly anticipating a ton of great tech deals to surface alongside all that news. Call it a happy accident, then, that a bunch of tempting offers still happened to pop up over the last few days, and some of our favorites are still available now. </p>
<p> Alongside the announcement of its new flagship smartphones — the P30 and P30 Pro, for those who missed it — Huawei also unveiled some new wearable gadgets. These include variants of the Watch GT aimed at slightly different audiences and some new audio products. </p>
<p> Huawei's latest smartwatch, the Watch GT, has been out in overseas markets for quite some time now. However, it's only just made its way to US shores. Amazon pre-orders for the $199.99 Watch GT Sport and $229.99 Watch GT Classic are up now, with the release date marked as February 19th. </p>

<p> watch history </p>
<p> Other than letting you watch linear TV anywhere you go, YouTube TV also allows you to save as many episodes and shows to a virtual DVR as you like. This likely helped grow many people's libraries to unsurmountable sizes, which makes it harder to keep track of what you've watched and what you haven't. Google seems to recognize this, as the company is starting to roll out a "mark as watched" option so you can manually sort out episodes you've already finished, in case the platform hasn't caught that you did. </p>
<p> It has been about six weeks since the last YouTube Gaming update rolled out, and it's clear the developers have been keeping pretty busy on making changes. The latest update has quite a few improvements to be found throughout the app, not to mention at least one feature that might be considered pretty huge. Topping the list is a new live comment stream that overlays gameplay videos so you can see the action and watch the commentary at the same time. A few features have been moved to more convenient places and a video history is now available. Finally, there's a new easter egg, and it's pretty awesome. </p>
<p> Version 1.50 of YouTube Kids started rolling out early Thursday morning. This update brings a really great new feature, and parents are going to love it. It's now possible to pause the watch history of YouTube Kids, and it doesn't affect the rest of your YouTube apps. A teardown also shows that parents will soon enjoy the benefits of YouTube Red, as well. As usual, if the update hasn't hit your account yet, jump to the bottom of the post to find a download link. </p>
<p> A brand new update to YouTube just started rolling out, and it gives users just a little more control over their privacy. The latest version adds a new option called "Pause watch history" so users can prevent new videos from joining their previously watched list. This joins an existing option to pause search history and two commands to clear the history from either list. Now we've got an easy way to keep prying eyes from discovering that we watch cartoons during lunch breaks. </p>
<p> The toggle for Pause watch history is located under the overflow menu -> Settings -> Privacy. Once it is enabled, videos you watch will not be added to your history. </p>

<p> watch instantly </p>
<p> I know that a lot of people have been waiting on this day to come, but I have to admit - it's slightly melancholy. Even though the Netflix app is finally here, there are only a handful of devices that it officially runs on. If your device didn't make the cut, though, I wouldn't sweat it too hard - you know how resourceful the Android community can be. </p>
<p> “a great engineer to help us build Instant Streaming client implementations on Android devices.” </p>
<p> Oh yes, you read it correctly, we have official word that Netflix will be coming to an Android device near you. </p>
<p> I’m an avid Netflix user and use their Watch Instantly service at least a few times a week on the Xbox 360 – in fact, their service was more or less single handedly responsible for my decision to cancel cable television. </p>

<p> Watchon </p>
<p> WatchON is a Samsung-exclusive offering that serves as a universal remote and TV guide all bundled up into one place. When the Galaxy S5 launched earlier this year, the Korean conglomerate released an updated version of WatchON for its new flagship device and introduced the app to the Play Store for the first time. Yet despite this Google Play presence, the updated version remained exclusively available to the Galaxy S5, and Samsung's other handsets were left with an older version of the pre-installed software. </p>
<p> Samsung hasn't added as many of its stock apps to the Play Store as Motorola, Sony, or HTC have, but it still uses Google's platform to distribute a few things. The new version of WatchON has been added to the Play Store for the Galaxy S5 (might also be available on the Note 3 Neo in some regions). This version of WatchON has a different look than older versions, and fits in nicely with Samsung's new design aesthetic. </p>
<p> Verizon has shared details for an upcoming Galaxy Note 10.1 software update that will bring Samsung's WatchON app to the device. The service, which comes pre-installed on many Samsung devices, turns your phone or tablet into an interactive TV guide. It comes with a universal remote for channel surfing, simplifies searching for shows, and enables you to watch some content across multiple devices. This functionality comes bundled as a part of software version JZ054K.I925VRAMK1. </p>
<p> Like Google has done with its own first-party apps, Samsung has placed its WatchON app on the Play Store for easy updates. Of course, it's still limited to Samsung hardware - this version has been updated for the Galaxy S4 (and the S4 Active, and likely a few more variants as they become available). Meanwhile the tablet app is being expanded to include support for the Galaxy Note 10.1 and both 7" and 10" versions of the Galaxy Tab 2. </p>

<p> Every year, around Apple WWDC time, I like taking off my Android geek and fan cap, putting it aside, and enjoying what our friends-slash-rivals from Cupertino are doing for their users. While a few years ago, I might've enjoyed discussions about which OS was superior, these days I'm mellower and more pragmatic. iOS has borrowed a lot from Android and continues to do so, and vice-versa. The two ecosystems have a mutually beneficial rivalry and keep pushing themselves further, and in doing so keep pushing each other too. </p>
<p> That's why I have fun watching WWDC's main keynote. I expect Apple to implement a few features that I've been wanting on Android for years, and to add a few innovative and obvious options that I never knew I needed but now can't get out of my head. </p>
<p> Every year, just like Google conducts its I/O press conference to introduce developers to the new Android version and announce all the upcoming features and APIs it will bring, Apple does the same. Its WWDC event took place this past Monday and, as any mobile enthusiast, we tuned in to see what the company has in store for its operating systems. While the dominating rhetoric over many years has been Apple's uncanny ability to announce an Android feature that has existed for years as innovative and ground-breaking, things have changed recently. 2019 was one of the most interesting thanks to plenty of both small and big additions to iOS 13 that leave us a little doe-eyed and jealous. </p>

<p> Watch Party </p>
<p> It's slightly more difficult to get together with friends to watch movies and TV shows, given there's a pandemic and all, which has led to a rush for group playback tools. Browser extensions for syncing playback across multiple people have seen a rise in popularity, and services like Prime Video and Plex have added native group play. Disney announced today that it is adding the functionality to Disney+, so you can host watch-alongs across all platforms. </p>
<p> With recent world events keeping us at home, it can be hard to stay connected with friends and family. Social events like going to movie theaters might not be an option right now, but that doesn't mean you can't watch a movie along with your favorite group of amateur film critics. Amazon is introducing a feature called Watch Party that lets groups of up to 100 Prime members view content together simultaneously. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/watch-sport/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549297" filename="watch-sport">
<p> Android Wear isn't an especially popular platform these days, but plenty of people still use it - enough for Google to have released two new smartwatches, the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style, earlier this year. But just eight months after their release, the Android Wear page has disappeared from the Google Store's home page. And more interestingly, both the Watch Sport and Watch Style are now marked as "no longer available." </p>
<p> At launch, the LG Watch Sport cost a whopping $349, putting it on the higher end of the Android Wear market. In fairness, it did pack a lot of features, but $350 is still a hard pill to swallow for a smartwatch. But now, you can get a brand new Watch Sport for just $239.99 - a substantial $110 off the original MSRP - at Daily Steals. </p>
<p> When the LG Watch Sport was announced, Verizon was on the list of carriers that would sell it. However, it's been three months since then, and Verizon still hasn't made it available for sale, with nothing being shipped to pre-orderers. It turns out that the chunky device has been completely canceled for Big Red. </p>
<p> While not exactly the best-kept secret, Google and LG's collaborative smartwatch effort was fully announced today with the detailing of the Watch Style and Watch Sport. Pretty much every rumor you've heard from us and others to date was on point here, so a lot of this is going to be rehash, but we'll go through the motions. </p>
<p> First, the details you'll want if you're a prospective buyer: Both watches go on sale on February 10th in the United States. Both will be on the Google Store, where you'll be able to get the Watch Style for $249 ($279 for rose gold), and the Watch Sport - including a Google Store exclusive blue version - for $349. </p>
<p> After revealing late last week that LG's Watch Style will come in at $249, today we can confirm via one of our trusted sources that its bigger, LTE-enabled brother will cost $100 more. The LG Watch Sport will have an MSRP of $349 here in the US, though it is unclear if color or band options could raise that price for certain configurations. </p>
<p> As a reminder, the Watch Sport brings a lot of features that the Watch Style will lack: LTE for true standalone functionality, NFC for Android Pay, GPS, a heart-rate monitor, a bigger, denser screen, and more buttons. </p>

<p> We're all trying to feel more connected online these days — the loneliness is strong. Sometimes the group chats and video calls aren't enough, and you wish you could just sit back and watch videos with your friends. Luckily for you, Facebook is continuing its trend of personal connection updates with the launch of Watch Together, a feature that will allow you to view videos simultaneously with a group. </p>
<p> There are third-party extensions like Scener that allow us to watch content from Netflix, HBO, and other services together while staying apart during these times of coronavirus-induced social distancing orders, but Plex is ready to up this with a native solution. It has announced a new Plex Labs experiment that allows you to watch shows, movies, and videos from your library together with others, perfectly synced up for everyone. </p>
<p> Hype for VR may have started to die down a bit, but software development applied to the various hardware platforms continues apace, and that includes YouTube VR. Yesterday it announced it would be coming to Samsung's Gear VR headsets this week, and it is also introducing a new way to share VR experiences called "Watch Together," which will allow YouTube VR users to watch and discuss content in a shared virtual space. A handful of new exclusive content will also be coming to the platform. </p>

<p> watch urbane 2 </p>
<p> The LG Watch Urbane 2 was exciting when it was announced, since it was the first Android Wear device capable of working as a stand-alone mobile gadget with a built-in LTE connection. Then it wasn't, because LG delayed the launch after an unspecified (but apparently quite serious) hardware defect. Now the launch is back on: AT&T announced its pre-order plans earlier this week, and now it's Verizon's turn. The carrier is taking pre-orders now, with watches shipping (and presumably ready at retail) on April 1st. No foolin'. </p>
<p> A lot of money, as it turns out. While the AT&T version of the Watch Urbane 2 is $360, or $200 with a two-year contract, the Verizon model is a whopping $499.99 outright. </p>
<p> Things did not go as planned for LG with the Watch Urbane 2nd Edition, which was originally supposed to come out late last year. A hardware defect caused the company to halt the release and bring the watch back to the drawing board. Now, it's ready to go again and AT&T will let you pre-order one right now. </p>
<p> Up until now, there have only been two gestures on Android Wear (both of which I use constantly): scroll up by flicking the wrist in, and scroll down by flicking the wrist out. I've found these to be quick and easy ways of interacting with Android Wear, especially when I'm busy with other things or my hands are full. Since these were introduced, I've often hoped for more gestures, especially for things like exiting apps or going to the next screen. </p>
<p> With Android Wear 1.4 (Marshmallow), Google must've realized how valuable gestures can be, because it brought three new ones to the table: select, go back, and exit to watch face. </p>
<p> So the LG Watch Urbane 2 LTE is available now from Verizon and AT&T, and we've had one in the house for a little over a day now. Since I've had some time to kind of run through it and see what it's all about, I figured this was as good a time as any to share some initial thoughts. So here we go. </p>
<p> First off, it's pretty thick. Like, a lot thicker than my current smartwatch — the Sony Smartwatch 3 — so I was a little worried about putting it on for the first time. You know what, though? That worry was really for nothing. </p>

<p> watch urbane 2nd edition lte </p>
<p> The rollout of Android Wear 2.0 has been a constant source of frustration for watch owners, as many models have taken months to receive the update. The Moto 360 Sport was updated last month, but there was another watch still waiting - the AT&T Urbane 2nd Edition. The first-gen Urbane received 2.0 back in April, and it started rolling out to the Verizon Urbane 2 around a month ago. But owners of the AT&T variant were left waiting, until now. </p>
<p> LG reached out to us moments ago with news that the company's upcoming smartwatch, the Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, has been canceled due to an unspecified hardware issue. There is no word at this time if the device will be released at a later date, but for now, LG is calling this a full-on cancellation of the launch. </p>
<p> We understand that you are currently reviewing our latest smartwatch; however, late in the quality assurance process for the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, our engineers were made aware of a hardware issue which affects the day-to-day functionality of the device. </p>

<p> Version 1.4 of the Android Wear app started rolling out late Friday. The theme of this update, at least for what's currently live, is a set of changes to the Settings screen. There are a couple of new options, but they come at the expense of the battery stats screen. A look under the hood also shows that a few other features are either live or in the works for the next Wear OS update. </p>
<p> It was rumored that LG would be launching a cellular-connected Android Wear watch soon, and well, here it is. The Watch Urbane Second (or 2nd) Edition is the first Android Wear device we've seen that uses a cellular connection instead of a Bluetooth connection to a smartphone or a local Wi-Fi network, much like Samsung's Gear S series or LG's own Watch Urbane LTE (neither of which ran Wear). Aside from the addition of a mobile connection, it's a round screen watch presumably using at least some of the same hardware as the older Urbane. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/watch-w7/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17562742" filename="watch-w7">
<p> Watch W7 </p>
<p> LG announced the Watch W7 last year with an exorbitant $450 price tag. Thankfully, that price didn't last long—the watch went on "sale" almost immediately and has never sold for full price. It's even cheaper than usual today, though. You can pick up this smartwatch for $190 at B&H. </p>
<p> In hindsight, LG's decision to launch the Watch W7 at $450 was a mistake. Selling expensive wearables is hard, and the mechanical hands gimmick is not exactly a big selling point. Retailers almost immediately dropped the price to $250, and now it's $50 cheaper than that. </p>
<p> If we're to listen to complaints about Wear OS, the one thing everybody agrees on is that OEMs should try new things. That's why it's interesting to see that LG's announcement of the Watch W7 instantly became the most criticized smartwatch of 2018 — possibly ever. It had an old chipset, a small-ish battery, and hands that obscured the screen. The watch was mocked so relentlessly, we had our doubts that it would ever come out. </p>
<p> But does it really deserve so much hate? There are certainly some compromises and problems, but when you start to consider that the W7 also comes with solutions for some of the common complaints about smartwatches, it might have some potential. I've </p>
<p> LG's announcement of the Watch W7 was met with jeers and derision. That was not only because mechanical hands on a smartwatch are a bit silly, but LG wanted a whopping $450 for the device. That was a tough sell in a world where Android smartwatches have yet to prove their utility, but that price didn't last long. After dropping almost immediately to $250, the Lg Watch Wy is now down another $30. </p>
<p> LG has just launched its latest smartwatch, and she is a weird one: the LG Watch W7. Unlike the company's past models like the Watch Style and Watch Sport, the W7 marries a circular LCD with a pair of mechanical hands — just like you'd find on an ancient dumbwatch. The idea's based around some sensible thoughts, like having the analog system offer battery life that extends into the months-long range, but between absent mainstream smartwatch features, a steep price tag, and those dang physical hands obscuring the smartwatch screen, it's difficult to pin down exactly who this watch might appeal to. </p>

<p> Notoriously radical "Un-carrier" T-Mobile has set two Guinness World Records in an astounding pair of stunts the company billed as "The World's Most 'Extra' Speed Test." Of course, both records involve water skiing. </p>
<p> There's a new update to Google Fit rolling out to [aspiring to be] healthy Android users, but there aren't any obvious signs of changes from just looking at the app. A little digging around under the hood reveals quite a bit is either in the works or just about to launch, including hydration logging and counting reps at the gym. We might also get to track climbing data soon and get notifications for activities that Fit isn't 100% confident about. Oh, and there are some more round icons because it was bound to happen eventually. </p>
<p> There are many Android developers out there who regularly crank out well-designed apps with thousands of downloads, but some of them are less obvious than others. The American Red Cross is one of those developers. Its apps aren't the most exciting things, but they're probably the only ones on your smartphone that could save your life - or, in this case, your kid's. The American Red Cross Swim app is a companion piece of software that wants to help guide you through the process of helping your kid learn how to swim, so they know how to stay afloat when the time comes to dive in. </p>
<p> Sprinkle Islands will feel instantly familiar to fans of the original game, as the core concept is the same. Players still control a water cannon atop a wooden fire truck on an alien world, their goal remains putting out any and all signs of fire, and the degree of challenge is still pretty high. If you haven't already familiarized yourself with this series, you might want to take a second to do so. The fundamentals of this sequel are largely unchanged, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Mediocre has tweaked enough to give the experience a fresh feel, even if some of those changes introduce a fair degree of frustration. </p>
<p> If you're either a fan of Disney's animated show Phineas and Ferb, or you simply prefer your detectives have evolutionarily curious anatomy, you'll want to pay attention. Where's My Perry? is a new game from Disney centered around Perry, also known as Agent P, a super sleuth that's just as comfortable on land as he is in water. Which is handy, because you need water in all of its forms to solve the puzzles in this game. </p>
<p> The game is actually pretty clever and great for kids, as you need to convert H2O between its various forms to complete puzzles by using various lasers. </p>
<p> A video has come to our attention the shows just how harshly you can treat the Motola Defy. It can take all the Hulk-smashings that inevitably result from using Motoblur for more than 10 minutes - in addition to being flushed down a toilet when you're done. </p>
<p> The video is about 3 minutes long, but all the action happens in the first 45 seconds. </p>
<p> The phone gets unapologetically dropped from shoulder-height then thrown into a glass of water, followed by a long length of having Motoblur. Those are the three worst things you can do to a phone, and the Defy takes it all in stride. </p>

<p> Ever since Google sold Motorola to Lenovo, the brand's strategy has been subject to change. In the past, there were only three model lines, but now, it's hard to discern the plethora of often all-too-similar phones released under the Moto name. There also hasn't been a proper flagship for a while, but Motorola is apparently looking to change that. OnLeaks and Pricebaba have teamed up to share renders and specifications of an alleged Motorola Edge+, and it could shape up to be the brand's new front runner. </p>
<p> How many ways can you build a rectangle? When it comes to smartphone displays, it can get quite excessive. Chinese manufacturer Oppo recently revealed its work on a panel with a highly-translucent portion containing a phone's front cameras. Now, the company is circulating images and video of what it calls a "waterfall display" — basically a curved edge screen, but with the curves on steroids. </p>

<p> Every so often, Motorola updates its camera app with bug fixes and maybe a couple of new features. This latest Moto Camera update is rather hefty, adding several new features. Highlights include a selfie portrait mode for all Motorola devices now, AR stickers for the Moto Z3 and Z3 Play, and a nifty watermarking feature. </p>
<p> Ting would like you to know that the Nexus 6 works great with its low price MVNO service. And it does: thanks to the N6's all-inclusive radio setup, the phone sold on the Play Store in the US can be used on both the company's CDMA and GSM network setups. There's just one problem - that's not a Nexus 6. </p>
<p> Nope, that's the Nexus 6 mockup that Android Police writer Liam Spradlin created way back in September, 2014. It's a testament to both our own news sources and Liam's superb graphic design skills that the mockup looks basically indistinguishable from the real thing, which was officially announced a month later. </p>
<p> ZTE is an up-and-comer in the smartphone world, one of about a half-dozen Chinese manufacturers that's slowly increasing its presence on the world stage. The company has released some impressive hardware, even if it never seems to get out of Asia. The ZTE Grand X Quad Lite was just announced for the Indian market. But apparently the sub-continental arm of ZTE lost their password to the company FTP. </p>
<p> Look closely at the sole press shot up there, and you'll see the unmistakable watermark of @evleaks, the Twitter tipster who seems to have scooped just about every major Android phone in the last few months. </p>

<p> water physics </p>
<p> Sprinkle Islands will feel instantly familiar to fans of the original game, as the core concept is the same. Players still control a water cannon atop a wooden fire truck on an alien world, their goal remains putting out any and all signs of fire, and the degree of challenge is still pretty high. If you haven't already familiarized yourself with this series, you might want to take a second to do so. </p>
<p> Sprinkle attracted quite the following when it debuted in 2011, using its realistic water physics to show people what Tegra 2-equipped tablets were capable of. Players controlled a wooden water cannon mounted on a crane and fought fires across a diverse assortment of stages, with water pushing rocks and giant blocks of ice around in order to save houses in hard to reach places. The fire itself was as pretty to watch as it was a pain in the rear, spreading from house to house as gamers discovered that maybe, just maybe, they weren't cut out to be firemen. </p>

<p> water proof </p>
<p> Samsung began calling its flagship Galaxy phones "water-proof" or "water-resistant" with the Galaxy S7 series, which received an IP68 rating, meaning it should be okay to submerge it into up to five feet deep water for a maximum of 30 minutes. That hasn't stopped the company from aggressively marketing its phones as great devices to use at the pool or on the beach ever since, without actually covering any water damage under warranty. The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) disapproves of these "misleading advertisements" and is taking the Korean company to court over them. </p>
<p> 6 cups chicken broth 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon dried basil 1 large onion, diced 1 large carrot, diced 1 large celery stalk 1 cup penne noodles 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 Sony Xperia Z </p>
<p> Heat chicken broth in a large pot over medium-high heat. Check your Xperia Z for any new emails. In a separate pan, heat olive oil, add diced onions, cook about 4 minutes. Pull up your favorite music video on the Xperia Z. Add onions, oregano, basil to broth. Chop celery and carrots. Accidentally cut your finger. Look up first-aid for deep cut on Xperia Z. </p>

<p> waterproof </p>
<p> For many of us, an external battery pack comes in near the top of our accessory priority list. Whether you travel for work or pleasure, topping up your gadgets on the go can be important, and that need can extend into durations or locations that require a few extra features or added durability. So, for all you outdoorsy types prepping for summer trips, we're taking a quick look at two new RAVpower batteries. One is "waterproof," both are solar-powered, and they clock in at 10,000mAh and 25,000mAh respectively. </p>
<p> Anker's latest addition to its Soundcore line of audio products, the Flare, is available now. The Flare is a cylindrical Bluetooth speaker that pumps out sound in all directions. It's water resistant and has a customizable light strip around the base, if you're into that sort of thing. Anker purports the Flare can manage up to 12 hours of continuous use on a charge. </p>
<p> The holidays are fast approaching and Amazon seems to be announcing one new product or service every day, so it's hard to keep up. The latest, however, is a waterproof Kindle with a larger 7" display that has us really jealous and itching for something like it but also compatible with Play Books. </p>
<p> Unlike its predecessors, the Oasis doesn't sport a 6" display, but takes it up a notch to 7". And it does that while reducing most bezels and thus still being roughly the same height and weight as the Paperwhite or Voyage. Only the width is larger, mainly thanks to that big black bezel on one side. </p>
<p> Unlike some other flagship phones, Google's Pixel and Pixel XL are not officially water-resistant - their Ingress Protection rating is a mere 53, much less capable than some Samsung and Motorola designs. If you're left feeling a little exposed, LifeProof has a case to sell you. Previously only available on the manufacturer website, the FRĒ series of cases are now being sold on the Google Store alongside the phones themselves. The good news is that the cases have an IP68 rating, meaning they're dust-proof and submersible for up to two hours in 2 meters of water. The bad news is that the cases cost $89.95, for either the Pixel or Pixel XL. </p>
<p> For the past 4 years, I've been wearing a Fitbit device of some sort. I started with the One, which stuck with me for the better part of 3 years, then I tried the Blaze, the Alta, and the Charge 2. My main complaint with each of these trackers was the lack of water-resistance, which meant that I couldn't wear them in the pool or track my swims with them. I've tried several swim trackers including the Misfit Shine 2 Swim Edition and Amiigo, looking for something that could replace Fitbit, but the best that I found was the Garmin vivoactive, which has excellent swim tracking and can send the main stats to Fitbit through MyFitnessPal. </p>
<p> Hopes of highly water-resistant Pixel phones have, according to a reliable source we've trusted in the past, been dashed. Google's new handsets will be advertised as having IP53 dust and water resistance, which essentially amounts to almost no enhanced water resistance at all. For reference, the HTC 10 also has this rating, and is not marketed as being water-resistant. </p>
<p> The "3" in IP53 means a device will not experience damaging water ingress when upright at an angle not to exceed 60 degrees from vertical while being sprayed by relatively low-pressure (somewhere between 7-20PSI or 50 to 150kPa) water. This probably means very little to you phrased this way, but IPX3 is essentially saying the device will not experience water ingress (i.e., </p>
<p> With Bluetooth speakers so common these days, it is pretty easy to find one that fits in almost every price bracket. One of the more popular ones that I see around my hometown is the UE Roll line, due in no small part to its portability and water resistance (Colorado folks like to go outside, what can I say). The Roll 2 brought some improvements, including a longer range and louder output than its predecessor, but it maintained the utter simplicity that makes this speaker iconic. Coupled with the UE Roll app, you can set up an alarm, adjust EQ settings, remotely power on the device, and connect up to three phones to it. </p>
<p> There are a lot of sports-oriented tech products, but not many are aimed squarely at surfers, skiers, and snowboarders. Which is why this new Android Wear smartwatch from Nixon – a major Californian manufacturer of watches and accessories – is so fascinating. </p>
<p> The Nixon Mission is a $400 smartwatch unabashedly aimed at extreme sports enthusiasts, and as a consequence, has been designed with an emphasis on durability. It packs a vivid AMOLED screen which is protected by a layer of Corning's Gorilla Glass 3, and a chassis constructed out of rugged stainless steel and polycarbonate. </p>
<p> The Nixon Mission is no slouch in the performance department either. </p>
<p> Saygus, the company that really will have an actual smartphone for sale any day now, they totally promise, has some more promises for you. A press release issued at Mobile World Congress lays out a series of improvements to the crowdfunded V-Squared phone, which should be easy to implement since the phone still isn't finished despite a first quarter manufacturing target. No less than four, count 'em, four new features have been introduced since... last year's Mobile World Congress. The fact that Saygus has missed multiple ship dates between now and then is conspicuously absent from the press release. </p>
<p> Those features are "waterproofing" (an interesting claim, since every other manufacturer has the sense to cover their asses with the term "water-resistant"), Android 6.0 software, dual-SIM card slots (a popular feature for unlocked and low-cost phones outside the US), and a USB Type-C port, a la that OnePlus 2. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S5 was water-resistant, one of the most hyped features of that particular Samsung generation. The Galaxy S6... wasn't. While the S6 and S6 Edge were huge leaps forward for Samsung in terms of both style and engineering, the loss of water resistance (not to mention expandable storage) was a bummer for some. T-Mobile employee Des would seem to agree, since he took advantage of the Ingress Protection 68 rating on the new Galaxy S7 to unbox the phone underwater. It sure beats the usual blogger's desk, right? </p>

<p> waterproof bluetooth speaker </p>
<p> The Altec Lansing Mini Bluetooth Speaker was already a bonafide steal with its rugged looks and ultra-affordable price tag of just $30. On this Cyber Monday, you can snag this mini wireless speaker for the cost of two cups of overpriced coffee. That's right, this baby can be yours for just $11.99 (60% off) right now on Amazon. </p>
<p> About a year and a half ago, I called the original Fugoo "the speaker I'd make if I made speakers." The design of it is actually brilliant — it's waterproof, offers 360 degree sound, is crazy-robust, and gets an insane 40 hours of battery life. Really, it's a beast. </p>
<p> Then, back at CES (yes, in January), Fugoo announced the XL. Like the name suggests, it's a big-ass version of the original Fugoo speaker. I've been waiting for what seems like forever to spend some time with it — as good as the original was, a bigger version is logically better, right? I mean, it makes sense to me. </p>
<p> If there's one market I've seen change dramatically over the last three years or so, it has to be the portable speaker scene. It went from being a category with a few mostly niche products that you had to convince yourself to spend a couple hundred bucks on to something pretty incredible - there's easily something for every type of person, lifestyle, and budget on the market right now. And really, it keeps getting better. More features, better sound quality, improved portability, and increased battery life are all things that we continuously see these days. </p>
<p> While we've looked at waterproof (or completely submersible) speakers in the past, the Nyne Aqua stands apart from the crowd with one very unique feature: it's not only waterproof, but it also floats. </p>

<p> Writing an unbiased review is a lot easier said than done. Every reviewer, myself included, has their own preferences, opinions, and experiences that will in some way affect his or her attitudes and conclusions. So rather than pretend that I am an unbiased reviewer, I will begin by telling you a little about the phones I have owned for the last few years. My hope is that this information will lend you greater insight into my thoughts and feelings regarding the Sony Z5. </p>
<p> I like Sony phones. I've owned every generation of the Sony Z series that T-Mobile has sold in the US, including the Z, Z1, and Z3. </p>
<p> With more and more smartphones featuring water resistance as standard, particularly Samsung's Galaxy S5, it seems like weatherproofing may be on the uptrend in the smartphone world. It's easy to see why - countless phones are lost to moisture-related incidents, whether it be a pool, toilet, or washing machine. Building phones designed to withstand the elements only makes sense, as nearly ever-present companions in our daily lives, our phones are bound to end up exposed to some less than electronic-friendly conditions during their lifetime. </p>
<p> So, with that in mind, how important is water-resistance, in particular, going to be for you when you make your next smartphone purchase? </p>

<p> The UE Boom 2 is one of the finest Bluetooth speakers you can buy. Great sound, long battery life, distinct styling, and a waterproof exterior make it stand out in the crowded group of competitors in the portable speaker arena. </p>
<p> It's also one of the pricier speakers on the market, normally selling for the premium of price of $200. With the support of a strong brand name and stellar reviews, the Boom 2 almost never dips below this price. </p>
<p> It happens to be on sale today. At least in a couple of color variations. The royal and baby blue 'Brainfreeze Edition' is currently priced at $166.42, and the obnoxiously bright pink and orange 'Tropical Edition' is even lower at $161.16. </p>
<p> Did you know that the bathroom is typically the most acoustically pleasing room in a house? The hard surfaces of tile, glass, and linoleum bounce sound wonderfully giving music added richness and depth. That's why we love to sing in the bathroom – it amplifies our voices and makes us sound better (fun fact, Weird Al Yankovic recorded his first single "My Bologna" in a bathroom). The only thing that makes singing in the shower even better is a little musical accompaniment from a water-resistant Bluetooth speaker, and today Amazon has one on sale. The TaoTronics water-resistant Bluetooth 3.0 shower speaker is just $10 after applying a $10 off coupon. </p>
<p> When asked which speaker company I think offers the biggest bang for the buck, the answer is pretty easy: it's either G-Project or Soundfreaq. Both are great companies, and each offers a lot of speaker for the money. They both target very different sets of users, however, so I don't really feel like they easily cross paths in the market. For example, Soundfreaq makes killer "around the house" speakers - they're not necessarily designed for ultimate portability, and they don't have a super robust look or feel to them. G-Project speakers, on the other hand, are built tough. They're made for outdoor use, to be thrown in a backpack, and to generally get beaten to death (not literally, of course). </p>

<p> The OnePlus 8T was announced today, and T-Mobile is the only carrier that will sell it in the US. This time around, T-Mobile's model gets a "+" stuck to the end of the name. It turns out that the T-Mobile model will come with IP68 certification, something that the unlocked model does not boast. </p>
<p> Sony may have announced and discontinued a zillion truly wireless earphones since the category’s inception, but it seems nowhere close to being content. Each of its newer pairs uses a slightly different combination of the company’s proprietary sound and noise-canceling tech than the previous model and calls it a day. The latest to join the company's portfolio are the WF-SP800N earbuds that sit closer to the premium WF-1000XM3 — both in terms of features and price. </p>
<p> The evolution of OnePlus's brand has seen it move from strong, cut-price smartphones to full-on flagship phones for only somewhat less than a typical flagship. Along the way, it has been able to afford more of the little things: flourishes in industrial design, global carrier partnerships, even advanced biometric and camera technology. With the OnePlus 8 Pro, the company now has brought another new thing at the table: an official IP rating for dust and water resistance. </p>
<p> Samsung has a solid lineup of rugged smartphones, but they usually get sidelined by their myriad of mainstream, lifestyle peers. Something similar happened when it revealed a brand-new adventure-ready phone on the hush-hush in Finland alongside four new Galaxy A and Lite models. The Galaxy XCover Pro appears to come packed with a bunch of rugged features making it sturdy yet usable in rough environments. </p>
<p> Samsung began calling its flagship Galaxy phones "water-proof" or "water-resistant" with the Galaxy S7 series, which received an IP68 rating, meaning it should be okay to submerge it into up to five feet deep water for a maximum of 30 minutes. That hasn't stopped the company from aggressively marketing its phones as great devices to use at the pool or on the beach ever since, without actually covering any water damage under warranty. The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) disapproves of these "misleading advertisements" and is taking the Korean company to court over them. </p>
<p> LG may not have the perfect track record when it comes to things like strength (or reliability), but it really looks like they're doing everything they can to turn that impression around with the new G6. They've just released a new promotional video demonstrating the device's durability in humorous but obviously controlled circumstances. </p>
<p> LG's next flagship, the appropriately-named LG G6, will be revealed at Mobile World Congress next month. In the G6's latest (and possibly intentional) leak, CNET reports that the phone will have a Snapdragon 821 processor as well as feature Google Assistant. </p>

Most of us are probably familiar with Qualcomm's various Quick Charge specifications, which it licenses to companies like Motorola and Samsung, but there are also other solutions out there. USB Power Delivery is an open standard that's growing more ubiquitous with each day, and OnePlus' Dash Charge breaks records—even as it breaks the USB-C spec. </p>

<p> Wireless charging was the hot new thing a few years back, then it faded away a bit. Now, it's coming back with Apple's decision to finally adopt one of the existing wireless charging standards. Every phone with wireless charging still needs to be sitting on the charging pad, but that could change soon. Wireless charging startup Energous has announced that its WattUp system has been approved by the FCC, making it the first "at-a-distance" wireless charging tech ready for consumers. </p>
<p> Do you know what RF pocket forming is? Neither do I! But if I told you it was potentially the way your future gadgets would be able to charge themselves over the air sans any wires or pads or other surfaces, would you be interested? I know I was, and that's what a relatively little-known company called Energous is hoping will get your attention. </p>
<p> Energous, despite not being particularly recognized outside its respective industry, is doing something with charging that seems legitimately revolutionary, and I had a chance to sit down and observe the technology in action. The thought of ditching your various docks, pads, cables, and wall warts in exchange for a box you stick on a wall or a table that charges your various stuff directly over the air, I admit, seems almost magical. </p>

<p> Based on a handful of reports on the OnePlus product forums, some 6T owners have run into a problem with their phone's display in which a pixelated sort of "wave" or pulse of bright colors travels up or down the screen. A reliable trigger can't seem to be found, but for those that are affected, it appears to happen more often on the lock screen while using either OnePlus' face recognition or the in-display fingerprint sensor to unlock the phone. </p>

Well, folks, guess what there's an app for now. It's called Wave Launcher - and it's great. </p>

<p> During the Google I/O keynote, Google talked about the WaveNet voice engine and how it was making speech synthesis more realistic. To drive the point home, Google announced six new Assistant voices were coming to devices. We expected them to roll out at a later date, but they're already live in the Assistant settings. </p>
<p> WaveNet technology from Alphabet research company DeepMind has been used to make the Google Assistant sound more natural since last year. It uses a deep neural network to generate more human sounding speech recordings, and because of that, the Assistant is much more pleasant to converse with. There have only been two voices to choose from until now, but Sundar Pichai has just announced at Google I/O 2018 that six more are available, as of today. </p>
<p> Back in December last year, we looked in-depth at the work Google has been doing to improve text-to-speech and other artificial language use cases. Artificial voice synthesis can be much more powerful and impressive thanks to WaveNet neural network technology, developed by Alphabet subsidiary DeepMind. It's been used to make the Google Assistant sound more natural, and now makes up part of a whole new product: Cloud Text-to-Speech. </p>
<p> Get ready for the little person living inside your phone and speaker to sound a lot more life-like. Google believes it has reached a new milestone in the quest to make computer-generated speech indistinguishable from human speech with Tacotron 2, a system that trains neural networks to generate eerily natural-sounding speech from text, and they have the samples to prove it. </p>
<p> When Google acquired British artificial intelligence startup DeepMind back in 2014 nobody was really sure why. It was a secretive company without any consumer-facing products, but it clearly had some technology of interest in Mountain View. DeepMind is now part of the wider Alphabet structure, and now a little bit more is known about what goes on there, including the work it does for Google. </p>
<p> One of the latest projects to come out of DeepMind is called WaveNet, a deep neural network for generating more natural artificial speech recordings, and its use case at Google is obvious. Google Assistant should sound much more human now that WaveNet has been incorporated into it. </p>

<p> For those of you who didn't grow to hate the original Wave Wave, developer Noodlecake has rebuilt the game with new visuals and gameplay. Frustration, however, remains perfectly intact, so newcomers should have their blood pressure under control before diving in. Take a look. </p>
<p> I know, the trailer isn't particularly enlightening, so here's how Wave Wave works. You control a rapidly moving line in a maze-like world that's constantly changing direction and color. </p>
<p> Noodlecake is one of those reliably solid publishers that tends to show up a lot in Android Police's game roundups. Like Crescent Moon before them, they've now got their own Humble Android Bundle showcasing some of their games at a great price. You can pay what you want for up to nine Noodlecake games at the moment, including three that are brand new to Android, and more are sure to come at some point. </p>
<p> We've hit that point in the life of every Humble Bundle where a new set of games jump in to flesh out the original selection. This time around, we're seeing the likes of Epoch, Mikey Hooks, and Zombie Gunship join the seven games that made up the initial batch. People who paid over the average at the time of purchase will get these new titles automatically, and those who do so going forward will get them just as well. </p>

<p> Yahoo's self-branded app for Android – called simple Yahoo! – has just moved up to version 1.0, an update that brings with it some not-insignificant enhancements. </p>
<p> First among these is the app's story streams and "summaries by Yahoo!", in which news stories are parsed into bite-sized summaries. The functionality is somewhat similar to Wavii's aggregation and summarization service, but is more probably tied to Yahoo's recent acquisition of Summly. While we can't be sure just yet if Summly's handiwork is making Yahoo's app tick behind the scenes, it was noted at the time of acquisition that the summary service's technology would "soon return to multiple Yahoo! </p>
<p> Wavii, a service that promises to help you "keep up with everything you care about" has been snapped up by Google, according to Tech Crunch, for a sum totaling over $30 Million. </p>
<p> The deal, which signals an end to an apparent acquisition battle between Google and Apple, likely means that Wavii's language processing prowess will be integrated with Google services from the Knowledge Graph all the way down to (perhaps) Google Now. </p>

<p> TWRP, short for TeamWin Recovery Project, is the custom recovery of choice for most in the Android modding community. With TWRP, users can do things like install custom ROMs, root their phone, and complete full backups — as long as their device is supported. Luckily, the list includes a broad range of phones and tablets, and it just keeps growing. Since our last roundup, TWRP came to devices including the Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra, Moto G6, and Nokia 6.1. </p>
<p> With CES coming up next month, we're starting to see more and more leaks that will likely materialize on the tradeshow floor. It looks like Chinese site Chip Hell has gotten its hands on one of NVIDIA's little secrets: the Tegra 4, which is codenamed Wayne. </p>
<p> The T4 looks to trump its predecessor in every way - much like the T3 did the T2. It uses the same 4-PLUS-1 core configuration as the Tegra 3, but it does so in a 28nm package - making it not only faster, but more energy efficient, as well. It also boasts six times the GPU cores as the Tegra 3, with a staggering 72 cores on board. </p>

<p> Depending on where you're at in the world, you may have some holidays coming up that demand long drives and a lot of time watching a screen as Google Maps directs the way back to family. There's a new update out that might make your trip planning and navigation just a little better. Version 9.41 has a new option to always start up in satellite mode, adds links to articles about top-listed businesses, and polishes the look for adding stops along a route. There are also hints that it will show when a hotel is running a good deal. </p>
<p> The update to Google Maps v9.31 brought a couple of fixes for users on Android N developer previews, not to mention some other small changes for everybody. But the most interesting things about this version are still buried below the surface. Yesterday, I covered support for offline maps to be installed on an SD card, and now it's time to dig into the rest of the teardown. If SD card support weren't enough, there are a couple of other features here that have been hotly requested for some time, so it's pretty clearly the Maps team is working hard to fill out the feature set for users. </p>
<p> Google began rolling out an update to Maps v9.26.1 a few days ago, and it's sporting a handful of new features. Like so many versions of maps, there are quite a few well-hidden changes in this one, far more than the single item written in the official changelog. Most of the changes are subtle enough that you won't notice them if you're not comparing side-by-side, but they are improvements all the same. There are even a few things from the teardown that don't appear to have made this version, but should be things to watch out for in the future. </p>
<p> What's New </p>
<p> Official Changelog: </p>
<p> Search along the route in bicycling and walking navigation. </p>
<p> Microsoft recently released Halo Waypoint to the Android Market, bringing an official multiplayer companion to the palm of your hand. The app has a surprising amount of awesome features, including live overhead views of multiplayer maps (with weapon, vehicle, and player locations), score information, and the ability to "stay in contact with your Halo friends on Xbox LIVE no matter where you are." </p>
<p> On top of all that, Halo Waypoint tracks your career and campaign progress and stats according to weapons and enemies, and enables users to invite friends to challenges from their mobile device. </p>

<p> wayward souls </p>
<p> Update: the developers released another quick update on September 19th, explicitly supporting the MOGA family of controllers. The NES30 mentioned below, a generic Bluetooth HID controller, is also working. Well done, Noodlecake and RocketCat! </p>
<p> -- </p>
<p> I've been playing the heck out of Noodlecake and RocketCat's Wayward Souls RPG-roguelike ever since it landed on Android. While the top-down action game does have some excellent touchscreen controls, there's just no substitute for a real gamepad. </p>
<p> The immensely difficult dungeon crawler Wayward Souls is currently up on Amazon for $1.99, one third of its usual price. That makes now a good time to pick up the game and walk away with a few dollars saved and a compelling title to boot. Not only that, buyers also get 60 Amazon Coins back, which amounts to 60 cents. For the math averse, that brings this title down to 140 coins for the people with virtual monies to spend. </p>
<p> Noodlecake has brought developer Rocketcat's Wayward Souls over to Android, enabling waves of new players to experience this challenging action adventure game. This title, which takes inspiration from the likes of Spelunky and Secret of Mana, pushes players out onto the floor of a randomly generated dungeon and wishes them the best, all while pounding them with horde after horde of enemies and challenging bosses. It's a fast experience that's easy to dive into and just as easy to get kicked back out of. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/waze-4-0/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17562615" filename="waze-4-0">
<p> The new Waze app has been in the works for a few months, and now it's finally ready to be unveiled. Waze 4.0 takes a lot of cues from the iOS version released back in October, both visually and functionally. It boasts a fresh new look, quick access to your frequent destinations, an improved driving experience, a new way to quickly share your ETA with friends and family, and plenty more features. </p>
<p> Waze 4.0 is on the way to Android soon, and with it comes a complete overhaul of the entire app's interface. Everything, and I mean everything, has been touched by this update. The app is still clearly recognizable as Waze, but definitely a much slicker, more animated Waze. I wouldn't call it "material" by any means, but it's certainly a lot more modern than what Waze is shipping right now. Take a look at these two GIFs for examples of just what I mean - even the traffic flow animation is now snazzier. There's also this fun little loading bar any time you start a route that shows potential obstacles and traffic on your way. </p>

<p> waze carpool </p>
<p> Waze isn't only a great tool to help you avoid traffic and accidents, it also makes it easier to share your commute with other people through its Carpool platform, available in the entire US since October last year. Thus, it only makes sense for Waze to team up with mobility service Moovit which aggregates public transportation and other mobility services to show you the quickest path from A to B. The partnership marks the first third-party party integration for Waze Carpool. </p>
<p> Commuting is hell. Carpooling can make it better, whether you do it for the environmental impact, the gas money, or some other reason. And while it's been easier than ever to get a pool together with the Waze Carpool app, it could be better at getting drivers and riders together. So, upon much user feedback, Waze has decided to update the app with a fresh new design and making things clearer for everyone. </p>
<p> We've all been stuck in traffic from time to time, and you might have noticed something interesting. Almost all the cars clogging the roads carry a single person, which seems like a terrible waste, right? Waze Carpool aims to change that by making it easier to catch a lift in the morning. After trialing Carpool in a few cities, Waze is now rolling it out across the US. </p>
<p> Commuters in the Evergreen State have a new option for getting around: Waze Carpool is now available in Washington. Waze says it chose Washington as its new location for the program largely because the state already has a large number of Waze users, with more than 375,000 in Seattle alone. </p>
<p> Waze is well known for its eponymous GPS navigation app, but what you might not know is that Waze also has a ride-sharing service called Waze Carpool that's in some ways (no pun intended) similar to Uber or Lyft. Carpool lets drivers get paid to use their own car to pick up and drop off passengers, and it allows riders to request a ride from point A to point B. However, unlike Uber and Lyft, Waze Carpool isn't meant to be used as a ride-hailing service — instead, it's only meant as a way for two or more coworkers (or people who work in the same general location) to share a ride to and from work. </p>

<p> IFTTT is a godsend solution for people who use different services and platforms and wish they could make them work better together. The idea of tying triggers from one device to actions on another is especially practical in the smart home, and even more so when you can use Google Home to control all those devices through IFTTT even if they don't have direct Assistant integration - yet. </p>
<p> With that said, IFTTT has just added support for 3 new products through new channels. </p>
<p> There are plenty of network-attached storage ("NAS") solutions available, however if you are a fan of Western Digital, you may be the owner of their My Book Live line of devices (available much cheaper on Amazon). Although reviews indicate that it is a solid product, it lacks a convenient method of remotely accessing the data, especially considering its MioNet solution is "nearly useless." Owners of this NAS will be pleased to hear that WD has launched the WD 2go Android app that helps bridge the remote access gap by providing an alternative method of viewing the content on your NAS. </p>

<p> Just as many people are getting a bit stir crazy from staying indoors, the Google Fit team is delivering some long overdue attention to the Android app and Wear OS. Over the next week or so, several enhancements to the interface are set to roll out, meant to make information more visible while streamlining the interface so users can quickly pull up the most important bits of data. </p>
<p> Wear OS has gone through quite a few evolutions over the last five years as it adopted apps, watch faces with custom complications, changes to notifications, and so on. The next big change is coming soon as Google prepares to take another step on the path it began with the last major update, and it's going to be called Tiles. </p>
<p> Android Wear, or Wear OS as it's now known, seems to have found renewed momentum lately with fresh efforts in fitness, updates to the interface, and new hardware coming on the horizon. The latest update brings one notable change the improves the interface for managing notifications, but also carries with it the signs of many other changes and additions to come. </p>
<p> Google is attempting to breathe new life into Wear OS with another redesign. Things are getting shifted around so that the most important stuff is front-and-center, or just a quick swipe away. On paper, it all sounds pretty good. </p>
<p> While you can run apps on Wear OS, the main reason for it to exist is to serve notifications. But for as much as notifications are useful, too many can be counterproductive. If you're finding that one or more of your apps is getting too noisy, but you're not quite ready to shut down notifications altogether, one good solution is to block those notifications from reaching your watch. Soon, you'll be able to access the settings screen to configure blocked apps by using a launcher shortcut. </p>
<p> A few years ago, a French computer science student named Florent Revest undertook a project to keep Android Wear smartwatches from dying of obsolescence. That project is called AsteroidOS, built entirely on GNU/Linux libraries and technologies, and in its current state, it's fairly basic. Even so, for all fans of open source software out there, this is pretty damn great. </p>
<p> Every week, I examine somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred app updates while looking for changes. The most interesting things turn into APK Teardowns or Download posts. Many of the remaining updates are unremarkable, amounting to a few bug fixes, routine updates to libraries, or even just pixel-level adjustments to layouts and images. However, there are usually a few updates that land somewhere in between. I don't want to spam readers with dozens of short posts, but I hate to ignore things that people might want to know about, so I'm going to wrap up the leftovers for a little weekend reading and call it Update Notes. </p>
<p> In late August of last year, Google announced some updates to its Android Wear policy which would affect the requirements for an app to obtain an "Enhanced for Android Wear" badge. Whereas previously, apps could qualify simply by implementing enhanced notifications, Google's planned policy change for January 18th, 2018 imposed some stricter restrictions. </p>
<p> The new policy would require apps to work as standalone Wear apps and force Wear APKs to be uploaded to the Play Store as a multi-APK instead of bundling them within phone apps. However, feedback on the multi-APK system has forced Google to delay fully implementing the policy, according to Hoi Lam, an Android Wear Staff Developer Advocate. </p>
<p> Android Wear 2.0, deep down inside, is based on Nougat 7.0. A bit over a month ago the platform saw news of a coming update to Oreo in the form of a beta program, originally only available for the LG Watch Sport. We presume that beta is now over, because Android Oreo is rolling out to Wear devices starting today. </p>
<p> Google announced last month that one of the plans for Wear 2.0 had been to make the platform easier to update with software upgrades from the Play Store rather than relying so much on sending out a barrage of firmware updates. In the v2.6 update, quite a few improvements and little tweaks have been made to the interface, including new connection indicators, download status notifications, a recent app complication, and more. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/wear-2-0/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17550298" filename="wear-2-0">
<p> Android Wear is entering a potentially critical time. Wear 2.0 hasn't been received nearly as well as might have been expected, with many observers understandably worrying for its future. Watches were conspicuously absent from Google's big hardware event last week, and the Google Store site refresh has removed all non-Google products, including LG's recently released Android Wear watches. </p>
<p> Wear fans could use some more good news to add to the recent announcement of the Oreo beta program for the LG Watch Sport, and it looks as though we have exactly that. Googler Hoi Lam took to Google+ yesterday to share some new information about future updates to Android Wear 2.0. </p>
<p> Internet radio app iHeartRadio is pretty popular with Android users and with good reason. It's built up an impressive feature set to go along with its attractive interface and is frequently updated with useful additions, such as Google Home support earlier in the year. The latest version brings with it a dedicated Android Wear 2.0 app, and you don't need your phone for it to work. </p>
<p> A lot of things have changed over at Moto following the takeover by Lenovo. For instance, the phones are modular and the watches are... nonexistent. The company still supports the older wearables, although owners of the Moto 360 Sport might disagree there. They've been waiting on an update to Android Wear 2.0 for ages, but it looks like the OTA is finally about to roll out. </p>
<p> 2017 has seen a sort of rebirth for Android Wear. Between v2.0 of the wearable OS and the LG Watch Style and Sport, the platform is still struggling to make headway. Besides the "run-of-the-mill" smartwatches that you can buy, there exists a special luxury segment where technology meets fine craftsmanship. Tag Heuer is one of the better known brands to launch ludicrously expensive Wear devices, but Montblanc is hoping to take some of Tag's mindshare. </p>
<p> Android Wear 2.0 makes a number of significant changes to the functionality of your watch, not the least of which is how you access the app list. Rather than a swipe, you press the crown button. If you want the swipe back (along with some extras), check out Launcher for Android Wear. It's a launcher... for Android Wear. </p>
<p> In Wear 2.0, Google is trying to make the watch more of a standalone device with its own version of the Play Store and apps that operate independent of your phone. However, that also means Play Music loses some features. It turns out you can't sync music from your phone to the watch in Wear 2.0, and downloads direct to the watch are very limited. </p>
<p> In continuing with the cavalcade of smartwatch announcements, Michael Kors has unveiled two new Android Wear offerings in its Access line. Both the Grayson and Sofie are the next step in the luxury brand's attempts at blending design, personal style, and technology. </p>
<p> In the world of technology, it's rare that a successor product is actually worse than the one that preceded it. </p>
<p> Today is a rare day. </p>
<p> The Huawei Watch 2 is a step backward - multiple steps, even - from the original, even if it does claw back some of that lost ground with new features. The Huawei Watch 2 adds NFC, GPS, LTE, and Android Wear 2.0 to its repertoire, which all sounds well and good. Alas, it all feels for naught when it comes down to the final product experience. What it takes away is almost everything that made the original the de facto champion of the Android Wear world. </p>
<p> The wait for OTA updates seems to be our "favorite" past-time these days. Android 7.0 or 7.1.1 for our phones, Play Store support for our Chromebooks, Wear 2.0 for our watches, we're almost always waiting for some new firmware to hit our devices. But one of these could be coming to an end soon: according to @HuaweiServiceDE, Android Wear 2.0 might be rolling to the Huawei Watch at the end of March. </p>
<p> Android Wear has been in a holding pattern since last year when Google announced that it was delaying the release of Wear 2.0. After months of re-working the software, Google unveiled Wear 2.0 alongside the LG Watch Style and Watch Sport. The smaller of the two was the one I had pinned my hopes on, and I'm sure many of you did too. However, the announcement showed we were off to a bad start with the lack of features like NFC and a very small battery. </p>
<p> We've already reviewed the Watch Style once, but I've been using the device for a while and have some thoughts on it as well. </p>

<p> wear24 </p>
<p> The Verizon Wear24 is definitely one of the more interesting Wear smartwatches out there. Announced on the same day as the LG Watch Style and Watch Sport, it took three months to go on sale, four months after which it was permanently discontinued. Since then, we've seen it steadily dropping to insanely low prices, though the current figure of $49.99 does seem to be the bottom line. Nonetheless, it still represents the greatest value for money of any Android Wear/Wear OS watch. </p>
<p> TWRP is the tool of choice for everything from flashing custom ROMs to backing up your phone. Last time we covered the project, it added support for the Moto X4. Since then, a few more devices have been added, including the Sony Xperia XA2 and Verizon Wear24 smartwatch. </p>
<p> Last May, Verizon thought it would be a good idea to start selling a $350 Android Wear smartwatch. Several months later, it discontinued the Wear24, and the leftovers have been popping up at a steep discount ever since. Today, the Wear24 has hit an all-time low price of just $50. That's $300 less than the original price. </p>
<p> Verizon surprised everyone when the company announced its Wear24 smartwatch the same day as Google unveiled the LG Watch Sport and Style. The watch was discontinued just four months later, probably because not very many people want a $350 smartwatch. Now you can get it for just $74.97, a $275 savings over the original price. </p>
<p> Not many people are interested in paying $349.99 for a smartwatch, which is probably why Verizon's Wear24 didn't do too hotly prior to its discontinuation. However, we've been seeing some incredible deals since then. Matching the lowest price we've seen thus far, Woot is offering new Wear 24s for just $74.99 (plus $5 for shipping) a pop. </p>
<p> Verizon's Wear24 Android Wear smartwatch originally retailed for $349.99, which was likely a factor in its discontinuation after just four months on the market. We completely forgot it existed until a week ago, when we spotted it on eBay for $129.99 a pop, which we thought was a pretty good deal. Now the Wear24 has fallen to an incredibly low $79.99, which is amazing given the specs behind it. </p>
<p> Verizon tried its hand at selling an Android Wear smartwatch earlier this year, but the $350 Wear24 was a flop and Verizon quietly pulled it after just four months. Perhaps this smartwatch will be more appealing now at a steep discount. The Wear24 has appeared on eBay for just $129.99, less than half the original price. Verizon's loss is your gain. </p>
<p> Verizon announced its very own Android Wear smartwatch earlier this year, powered by its LTE network. It started selling the Wear24 in May for $300 on contract and $350 without one. That seemed like an interesting proposition when consumers have shown little interest even in cheap smartwatches. Verizon didn't let this product languish too long, though. We've confirmed with the carrier that Wear24 is dead. </p>
<p> The announcement of Verizon's Wear24 smartwatch was a bit unexpected, as there were no rumors about it beforehand. Then the company went silent about it for a while, then said in April that it would go on sale May 11. Well, now it's May 11, and you can actually buy it. </p>
<p> Verizon announced its very own Android Wear device a few months ago, but it didn't have specs or an exact release date. The previous "next month" release window came and went (that would have been March), but now we've got more specifics. The device launches in 24 days (because Wear24), and there are a couple items on the spec sheet. </p>

<p> wear 3100 </p>
<p> With the Summit 2, Montblanc was the first company to release a smartwatch powered by Snapdragon's latest Wear 3100 chipset. The luxury brand just unveiled an updated timepiece, which now comes with built-in LTE, along with other improvements. </p>
<p> It isn't easy to find a Wear OS device that is feature rich, affordable, and small enough to evade classification as a planet these days, but Fossil's new Sport smartwatch is certainly enticing. It's not too big (41 or 43mm case sizes), features the latest in wearable processing (Snapdragon Wear 3100), and covers all the standard bases (5 ATM water resistance, NFC, heart rate sensor) for $255. But in case you're thinking that's still a little bit pricey for what's on offer — you're probably right. But you're also in luck, because there's 30 percent off site-wide on Fossil products for Black Friday in the US, available immediately. </p>
<p> Fossil has been one of the few companies keeping Wear OS afloat over the past several years as we waited and waited... and waited for a new Qualcomm wearable chip. Well, the Snapdragon Wear 3100 is out there, and now Fossil is launching its first smartwatch with one. The generic-sounding Fossil Sport Smartwatch is a colorful, feature-rich wearable, and it's out in just a few days. </p>
<p> When Qualcomm revealed its new Wear 3100 chipset — a long-awaited yet minimal update that put battery life ahead of performance — it also took the opportunity to show off one of the first partner devices. Now, that device is available for purchase. The Montblanc Summit 2 is a good representation of the type of Wear OS device Qualcomm is betting on going forward. It's a fashion smartwatch that begins at $995 and caters to the luxury jet set demographic. </p>
<p> It's been two and a half years since Qualcomm revealed its first dedicated wearable chipset, Wear 2100, and, in that time, there's been no major update. This has led to some doubt regarding the chipmaker's interest in the market — a crucial element for Wear OS' continued existence, considering Qualcomm powers 80 percent of Android smartwatches out there now. The San Diego chipset giant asserted its continued intention to dominate the Wear OS market today, however, with the reveal of Wear 3100 — and the subtext of the announcement has indications for the industry at large. </p>

<p> wear 5.1 feature spotlight </p>
<p> Setting a timer or alarm has been one of my favorite conveniences since I started using a Wear device regularly 6 months ago. Granted, they aren't must-haves in my life, but they do come in handy occasionally, and I find myself using them on Wear more often than I would on my phone. </p>
<p> Google is probably well-aware these features get a comparatively high amount of use on Wear, so they've completely revamped the UIs and even added some features that make these tools even more useful. While we haven't yet highlighted the new activity launcher in our Wear 5.1 feature spotlights, you can find dedicated listings in that launcher for the timer, stopwatch, and alarm that were not present in the old "start" UI of Wear 5.0. </p>
<p> Android Wear 5.1 is surprisingly full of new features, and the lock screen may be one of the more exciting ones. Until now, there was no OS-level way to secure your Wear device from unauthorized use. With Wear 5.1, a pattern lockscreen has been introduced, and it should pop up any time Wear detects your device is no longer on your wrist. For a quick walkthrough of the feature, see the video below. </p>
<p> Setting up a lock screen is dead simple, just go into settings, find the lock screen option, and enter the 4-point-or-greater pattern you want to use (twice). At this point, your watch is set up to lock its screen whenever it no longer detects it's on your wrist. </p>
<p> App discovery on Android Wear isn't outstanding to start with, but one thing that always rubbed me the wrong way was just how blissfully unaware you could be that an app you had installed on your Android smartphone also installed a Wear mini-app on your watch. With Android Wear 5.1, you'll live in ignorance no longer: every time a new Wear app is installed on your watch, it'll serve up a notification letting you know, just like the one above (this is also true for watch faces). </p>
<p> Is it a small feature? Absolutely. But it's one of those things you're happy to have when you do, and might not even know you miss when you don't. </p>
<p> One thing that I've always found annoying about notification management on Android Wear is that dismissal is generally handled in bulk. If an app is serving you multiple notifications, like Inbox, for example, you can't go through each of those messages and dismiss them individually. Nope, you can either dismiss all of them or none of them (unless you use a specific action that subsequently dismisses the card, eg, "Done"). </p>
<p> Android Wear 5.1 appears to have addressed this in some apps, with the Inbox, Hangouts, and Calendar apps on Wear now allowing you to dismiss single cards from a larger stack, instead of having to swipe them away en masse. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi connectivity has been one of the real headline features for Android Wear 5.1, and rightly so: this new functionality will allow your Android Wear device to stay connected to the internet even when your phone is nowhere to be found (so long as you have a saved Wi-Fi network nearby). Here's what we've learned about the feature in using it so far, including a video primer of how to get it set up. </p>
<p> First things first: this feature will not allow you to use a Wear device without ever connecting it to a smartphone. An Android smartphone is still required, because things like entering the Wi-Fi network password take place on the paired phone rather than the watch itself. </p>

<p> With the advent of the fitness-focused wearable, everyone suddenly became a lot more conscious of their health. Fitbit introduced blood oxygen saturation monitoring for many of its existing smartwatches earlier this year, and now the company is giving customers a new watch face to easily check SpO2 levels at a glance. </p>
<p> OnePlus has grown popular by making affordable phones and has more recently started designing accessories, such as its $80 buds. The company is reportedly continuing to work on releasing more than just handsets, as a new listing has appeared referring to a product called the OnePlus Watch. </p>
<p> Singapore's IMDA regulatory body lists a device called the OnePlus Watch on its Telecoms Licensing System, which doesn't reveal much, besides the model number being W301GB. Despite the lack of information, it's likely for the smartwatch to run Google's Wear OS and be powered by Snapdragon's new Wear 4100 SoC. In fact, the new chip and Google's upcoming Wear OS update might have convinced the OnePlus team the platform was mature enough for them to launch a smartwatch. </p>
<p> Back in March, Chinese manufacturer Oppo announced its first smartwatch, sporting a design similar to the one of an Apple Watch. The device, called the Oppo Watch, was exclusively meant to be sold on the Chinese Market and ran an in-house Android-based OS. However, a new promotional video seems to point the company is about to release a refreshed version of the product that will ship with Wear OS. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/06/16 3:43pm PDTon Jun 16, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/25 8:32am PDTon Jun 25, 2020. </p>
<p> Samsung's Tizen smartwatches are stiff competition for Wear OS on the Android side of wearables, and now it looks like the latest model is nearly ready to arrive. A couple weeks back we saw a presumptive Galaxy Watch 3 strut its stuff at the FCC, and more recently rumors talked about a possible public unveiling sometime in July, but we still didn't have a ton to go on. Now our expectations are starting to really take shape, as possible specs for the upcoming Galaxy Watch 3 have been released, and they look like solid upgrades over the previous generation. </p>
<p> Garmin's line of wearables are some of the more fitness-oriented watches available, designed not only to help you with every kind of workout but to function as a fully-featured smartwatch. Today, Garmin has placed its Vívoactive 4 and 4s watches on sale for just $270, a full $80 off the standard retail price. </p>
<p> If you're on the market for a Wear OS watch, the Skagen Falster 3 is one of the best ones around. It's not cheap, though, as its original retail price was $295, but it's currently down to $238 on Amazon, making it a bit more affordable. For this price, you get the latest tech and a sleek minimalist design, making it worth considering. </p>
<p> Fitbit's Ionic smartwatch was the brand's first product to feature an SpO2 sensor, which is used in estimating blood oxygen levels. Several other Fitbit products, namely the Versa, Versa Lite, Versa 2, and Charge 3, came with a similar sensor, but it had stayed dormant until December. After being tested with a few users, the feature appears to be rolling out more widely. </p>
<p> The original Moto 360 was the first mainstream smartwatch with a round screen (ignoring the 'flat tire' at the bottom), which meant that despite its terrible internal hardware, it was definitely unique among a sea of ugly square smartwatches. Motorola followed it up with a sequel in 2015, and then in 2016, the company said it was done making wearables. </p>
<p> The new Moto 360 is almost entirely disconnected from its predecessor (it's manufactured by eBuyNow, not Motorola) and lacks the technological and design innovation that made the original watch so special. Much like a direct-to-video Disney sequel, there's not much to complain about, but there's also nothing unique or interesting to speak of. </p>
<p> Withings gained popularity thanks to its health-focused products, including its smart scale, fitness trackers, and hybrid smartwatches. The company is innovating once again with the announcement of its ScanWatch, the first hybrid smartwatch to combine AFib and sleep apnea detection. </p>
<p> Finnish exploration and sports specialist Suunto has just announced its first Wear OS smartwatch, and it comes with one especially neat trick up its sleeve. The Suunto 7 features full-color offline outdoor maps so you can follow your live location no matter where you are. This rugged watch and sports tracker isn't cheap at just under $500, but its feature-set might just make it worth the money. </p>

<p> We've all had the tremendous need to make absolutely sure everyone within earshot knows what we are listening to. Well, right now you can fill that void by picking up the LG Tone Studio not-quite-headphones for $137 over at Amazon. We've caught the price drop on these three times before, but this is the lowest we've seen them at yet. It's such a hot deal, in fact, that it looks like Amazon blew through their available stock. You can still place an order, but it might not be fulfilled for a while. </p>
<p> I never would have expected LG's Tone lineup of Bluetooth headsets to reach the kind of popularity that it has. The goofy around-the-neck design looks awkward and cumbersome and I personally prefer a more freeing design like the Plantronics BackBeat GO or Jaybird Bluebuds series. But what do I know? People not only bought 20 Million of LG's Tones, they also seem to like them, at least based on various reviews of the different models. And that's why LG keeps reiterating on the design. </p>
<p> The latest is the Tone Studio, which was announced at CES 2017. It takes the original around-the-neck earphone design and... adds four speakers. </p>

<p> In the era before modern smartwatches, Fitbit's name became synonymous with wearable fitness trackers. Full-fledged smartwatches have become the norm as consumers have demanded more and more from wearables, and Fitbit stepped in with the Ionic and Versa smartwatches a few years ago. I had high hopes that Fitbit would continue to improve and provide Android users a viable alternative to the increasingly frustrating Wear OS experience, but the Sense has some of the same shortcomings and bugs I remember from the Ionic. The Sense also has its own raft of new glitches that I find equally annoying. At the same time, Fitbit promises this watch can do so many things! </p>
<p> When you hear the word ”smartwatch,” the last name that probably comes to mind is PUMA. Despite all other major athletic brands having thrown their weight behind wearable tech — like the Under Armour Samsung Galaxy Watch, Nike Apple Watch, and Adidas Fitbit Ionic — PUMA has remained out of the wearables race… that is until the PUMA Smartwatch made its debut at IFA 2019 as the newest Fossil partner. I’ve been wearing the PUMA-branded Wear OS device for the last two weeks, and there are some things you should know before strapping one around your wrist. </p>
<p> Google and LG set out to build a pair of watches to launch Android Wear 2.0. What resulted were two wildly divergent products that make no attempt to hit the middle ground. Richard reviewed the Watch Style, which features a lithe frame but includes fewer features than almost any Wear-based smartwatch that came before it. I'm looking at the Watch Sport, an unapologetically huge device with a wide array of capabilities that allow it to be a serviceable stand-in when you leave your phone behind. LG held nothing back with this watch, but it's not right for everyone. </p>
<p> Everyone was intrigued when Fossil announced it would make Android Wear devices. After all, it makes "real" watches, so maybe its smartwatches would be a cut above. The Q Founder was an okay smartwatch for its time. It was a little big, but it looked nice and had a fast Intel SoC. Now, Fossil is back with the Q Marshal and Q Wander. These smartwatches are some of the first to have the wearable-focused Snapdragon 2100 chip, but is that enough to make them a good purchase? Sadly, not really. </p>

<p> wearable speaker </p>
<p> The concept of wearable speakers is relatively new and weird, and the benefits are questionable for most people. It's a category of devices that sits somewhere between regular old speakers and headphones. They're supposed to make the sound feel even more immersive as you enjoy your home cinema, while neither disturbing nor blocking out your surroundings. One such product is Sony's SRS-WS1. It's been available overseas for quite some time already, and it's now coming to the US. </p>
<p> We've all had the tremendous need to make absolutely sure everyone within earshot knows what we are listening to. Well, right now you can fill that void by picking up the LG Tone Studio not-quite-headphones for $137 over at Amazon.

You can still place an order, but it might not be fulfilled for a while. </p>
<p> LG's new Tone Studio headphones are a little awkward. They follow the same design as the company's well-loved neckband Bluetooth earphones, but they add a speaker in case you want to envelop yourself in music without actually stuffing something into your ear. I can understand the use case for those who are constantly mobile in a certain environment, say while they move from home to car to office or while they clean different rooms of the house, and who don't want to bother with connecting and disconnecting from multiple speakers and headsets. That doesn't make the idea any less awkward though. </p>

<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Wear OS apps and faces that went live on the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous six months or so. Since our last collection, Google has changed the branding from Android Wear to Wear OS, and there are finally devices in the market that contain the new Snapdragon 3100 chip, which allows for more features, such as a visible second hand when the ambient mode is on. While I'm sure the progress of Wear OS isn't moving as fast as enthusiasts would like, there's no arguing the platform isn't dead yet. </p>
<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Wear OS apps and faces that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous seven months or so. It's been a slow process cataloging each Wear release since February, but I think we finally have enough to push out another roundup of the best Wear OS has to offer. </p>
<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Android Wear faces that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous 3 months or so. </p>
<p> A new version of Play Music is available this afternoon and it's making a big leap in versions from 8.0 to 8.5. This update doesn't come with the redesign that had seemed likely after last month's visual refresh to Play Music on Android TV. But cosmetic touchups were in the cards as the adaptive icons for app shortcuts were fixed in this release. Additionally, Play Music lost some megabytes after unbundling its Wear app. </p>

<p> Okay, you may have noticed that it has been quite a while since the last Android Wear Roundup. The good news is that I am here to take the reins and get this thing going again. Since it has been such a long while, there are quite a few items to go through. This is why I have split the post into two separate pages, as it was way too long for a single page. Rest assured, I will be making sure this Roundup has more of a regular schedule in the future. But hey, enough of that nonsense, let's dig into a super long list of Android Wear apps and faces! </p>
<p> If you're among the crowd that both installs Android developer previews and also owns an Android Wear watch, you've probably noticed some of the apps that belong on your watch have been missing. This happens because the stock apps included with the developer previews are missing the micro-apks for Wear. As the official release of Android 7.0 draws near, Google has been slowly releasing app updates that can install over the stock versions on the developer preview. And as of yesterday's stream of updates, Google Messenger joins that list. </p>
<p> "The Beeb on your wrist" might be mistaken for Cockney slang by some poorly-travelled American blogger, but in this case it's the latest feature to hit the official BBC Worldwide news app. The update to 3.2 for BBC News UK and BBC News Worldwide will send short snippets of stories to your Android Wear device. The only other changes are bug fixes and some layout adjustments for the primary, non-wearable app. </p>
<p> BBC News on a watch is surprisingly usable. A title, header image, and short paragraph for each story are displayed in a sort of mini-RSS style. The layout lets you swipe horizontally and vertically: go up or down to move between the "Top Stories," "My News" (selected on the smartphone app), and "Most Read" categories, and swipe left or right to move between individual stories. </p>
<p> It seems like one out of every four searches I make sends me to Wikipedia for one thing or another - for example, the metric prefix atto- means 10 to the negative eighteenth power, or one quintillionth, or really quite amazingly bloody small. Google itself defaults to a lot of Wikipedia pages for its Knowledge Graph info, and you'll get small cards full of Wikipedia content for many searches from Android Wear. But developer Dheera Venkatraman (whose previous Wear apps Wear Camera Remote and Matrix face we've already written about) has an even better solution. </p>
<p> Attopedia is a surprisingly effective Wear app for browsing full Wikipedia pages. </p>

<p> wearbuds </p>
<p> True wireless Bluetooth earbuds were introduced in 2014 by the likes of the Bragi Dash and later popularized by the Apple Airpods. Since then, we've seen incremental developments like fitness tracking on the Jabra Elite Active 65T and wireless charging on the Samsung Galaxy Buds, but the form factor has essentially remained the same — a pair of earbuds stored inside a charging case that goes in your pocket. Aipower, a sub-brand of Aukey, is looking to shake things up with the Aipower Wearbuds (that recently went live on Kickstarter) by combining true wireless earbuds with a wrist-based fitness tracker. </p>
<p> Truly wireless earbuds are great to have, but if you want to use them for extended periods of time, you have to bring along the charging case. Most cases are thicker than the average smartphone, and can be uncomfortable in your pocket (especially alongside your phone, wallet, car keys, etc.). Aipower's new wireless earbuds are more convenient to carry around than any other earbuds — because they can be stored on your wrist. </p>

Typically AP includes apps in our Wear OS roundups, but sadly I don't have any to share this time around. This means today's roundup will specifically highlight a bunch of new watch faces, and since I have so many to share I've split the list into two separate pages for easier consumption. You can expect to find the flashier faces on the first page, and the more traditional designs are located on the second page. </p>

<p> Wear OS is far from being the most praised smartwatch operating system, an issue Google is well aware of. Thankfully, the company worked on improving it and introduced widget-like tiles in May. Sadly, these were capped to just five, a restriction that's now being lifted. </p>
<p> Wear OS has fallen by the wayside in recent years, but the updates coming with Android 11 offer some encouragement. Diesel has been experimenting with translucent designs for a while now, and the company's newest release takes it to the next level. The DT2023 is a limited-edition version of the Fadelite DT2021 watch. It's a collaboration between Diesel and digital artist Mad Dog Jones — and I don't know if I love it or hate it. </p>

<p> Google announced a pretty substantial Wear OS update last month, stating that it would be coming in the fall. We're still a couple weeks out from fall, but Finnish brand Suunto is already pushing this performance-improving update to its Suunto 7 watch. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/01/13 8:01am PSTon Jan 13, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/06 9:24am PDTon Sep 6, 2020. </p>
<p> These days, there are two primary options for Android-compatible smartwatches. You can use a watch powered by Google's own Wear OS software, or pick up a Galaxy Watch from Samsung. Both platforms get most of the basics right, but depending on which features you care about the most, one might be better than the other for you. </p>
<p> In this guide, we'll go over the key differences between both platforms, so you can make an informed smartwatch purchase. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/08/19 1:34pm PDTon Aug 19, 2020 and last updated 2020/08/21 11:14am PDTon Aug 21, 2020. </p>
<p> It's fair to say that Wear OS has been stagnating lately. Google announced a few updates for its smartwatch operating system last week, but they're more like minor improvements than the major overhaul many feel the platform needs. Fossil and its subsidiaries make a lot of Wear OS watches, and now the company is taking matters into its own hands with an exclusive update that adds new health-tracking capabilities, a Phone app tile, and more. </p>
<p> Google's Wear OS platform has been in a holding pattern for much of the past year, while the company waits for its acquisition of Fitbit to go through (or be shut down over antitrust lawsuits). Thankfully, Google hasn't completely forgotten about its existing wearable platform, as a new update is coming in the fall with some much-needed improvements. </p>
<p> Google Play Music is being phased out in favor of YouTube Music starting next month. That change already exacerbates the need for the latter to achieve a desirable feature parity with its predecessor, but it also now presents a challenging chasm for Wear OS users who will lose access to Play Music without a robust YouTube Music experience. </p>
<p> The Misfit Vapor X was released last year by Fossil Group, and has most of the bells and whistles you would expect in a modern Wear OS smartwatch. It started off at $280, but right now you can get it for as low as $15. No, you didn't read that wrong. </p>
<p> Back in March, Chinese manufacturer Oppo announced its first smartwatch, sporting a design similar to the one of an Apple Watch. The device, called the Oppo Watch, was exclusively meant to be sold on the Chinese Market and ran an in-house Android-based OS. However, a new promotional video seems to point the company is about to release a refreshed version of the product that will ship with Wear OS. </p>
<p> Mobvoi is one of the few companies still taking the future of Wear OS seriously and releasing new hardware. But today Mobvoi has a deal reaching into the past. The company's 2018 flagship smartwatch, the TicWatch Pro, is available on Amazon for just $139.99, a savings of $60 off recent prices. </p>

According to an official teaser image posted to Weibo, a rectangular smartwatch that could pass for an Apple Watch will be announced next week. </p>
<p> It's almost time to go back to school, and what better way to make sure you're on time than a brand new smartwatch. Thanks to this deal on Mobvoi's smartwatches, you can save between 15 to 20% on four models, which range from $136 to $250 depending on your needs. </p>
<p> 2019 has been a sad year for WearOS, as the platform witnessed the death of several apps over the past few months. Runkeeper is the latest company to announce the retirement of its application on WearOS devices, claiming the experience was buggy for most users. </p>
<p> Possibly frustrated by leaks, more companies seem to be going ahead and leaking upcoming products themselves — Google did so yesterday with the Pixel 4, and now Mobvoi has published (and then taken down) a landing page which revealed a new LTE equipped TicWatch Pro. </p>
<p> Google is attempting to breathe new life into Wear OS with another redesign. Things are getting shifted around so that the most important stuff is front-and-center, or just a quick swipe away. On paper, it all sounds pretty good. </p>
<p> Hublot has become the latest watchmaker to delve into the realm of Andr- I mean, Wear OS watches. Its new watch, dubbed 'Big Bang Referee 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia' (seriously) will be worn by referees for the --- you guessed it --- 2018 FIFA World Cup, and it'll retail for 5,000 Swiss francs (~$5,200 US). It'll be limited to 2,018 pieces. </p>

<p> Google has been making a big deal about its Assistant for a long time now, going so far as to call it "your own personal Google." It's made it onto phones, Chromebooks, and smart speakers, but it's never been available on a third-party smartwatch — until now! According to code found in the latest version of the Fitbit Android app, the company is working on adding integration with the Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Chinese firm Mobvoi — founded by ex-Googlers — has a history of making connected watches that stretches back to its original TicWatch and TicWatch 2 running the proprietary TicWear OS. Around this time last year, the TicWatch S and E were launched with Wear OS (then Android Wear) on board, and they were praised for their quality and excellent value proposition. </p>
<p> Now, Mobvoi is back with a premium Wear OS smartwatch, the TicWatch Pro. It offers better build quality and adds NFC, but the real star of the show is a transparent second display for more efficient always-on functionality with the promise of excellent battery life. </p>
<p> Earlier today, Google announced that Android Wear is being rebranded to 'Wear OS by Google.' For now, this is a simple renaming of the OS, with no functional changes to be seen. Google has now released a list of every watch that will receive the Wear OS update, and it looks identical to the list of watches that have been updated to Android 8.0 Oreo. </p>

<p> As we all know, OnePlus is working on a OneUI-inspired redesign for its flavor of Android 11, and the first fruits of that work are already available for everyone to see on their OnePlus phones. The company has updated the Play Store beta of its weather app with the new visuals from OxygenOS 11. </p>
<p> Google turned its News app into a great resource, making it easy to pull articles from multiple sources and compare what each outlet is writing. But the app also functions as a rudimentary weather hub, offering you an always-accessible shortcut to the current conditions and forecasts at the top of its homescreen in your briefing overview. The developers have now added a severe weather alert tailored to your location, helping you become aware of any potential weather hazards when you need to head out. </p>
<p> Android Police maintains a giant list of apps that are participating or have participated in Google's Play Pass program — where users pay a low subscription fee to remove ads and access premium features from said apps. But it's a finicky list to maintain because every addition is manual and it's extremely difficult to track any subtractions without a public database. Well, we can report on at least one departure that will take effect soon: AccuWeather is leaving Play Pass on September 20. If you use the weather app, you might not like the reason why. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/01 2:35pm PDTon Apr 1, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/31 10:50am PDTon Jul 31, 2020. </p>
<p> As of August 1, Dark Sky is dust — at least for us Android users. At the end of March, it was announced that Apple had acquired the popular weather app and would be shutting off Android access on July 1. Turns out the company would end up extending that deadline by a month. Whoop-de-doo. But since then, we've seen a fake Dark Sky app pop up and then get put down in the Play Store. We get it: people are passionate about their weather apps. So, as Dark Sky finally makes it to pasture, we're once again updating our list of our favorite Android weather apps. </p>
<p> Dark Sky may get to live on Android for an extra month until August 1, but after that, it's time to look for a new weather app. The competition is well aware of that and is bringing its applications up-to-par. As such, AccuWeather has been working on a full overhaul of its slightly dated app, featuring a new icon, more native code, an hourly minute-by-minute forecast front-and-center, and tons of customization options, including dark modes. The new app will roll out to the Play Store starting today. </p>
<p> Google has been working on an Ambient Mode for Chrome OS for quite a while — like Chromecasts or Nest displays, it's meant to show you a slideshow of artworks or a selection of images from your Google Photos library while your laptop is charging. For a few months, that's all the feature did, but the latest developer build of Chrome OS 85 changes that, as Chrome Unboxed reports. When you activate the corresponding flag in that channel, you'll see a clock and a weather widget in the bottom left corner, just like you would on a Chromecast. It's still work in progress, though. </p>
<p> WeatherPro has been around on Android for more than ten years and has gone through changes on both the visual and the monetary front — the subscription-based app used to be a paid product back in 2018 before the company behind it joined forces with another one. Now, the app has received a comprehensive redesign, giving it a rethought bottom bar interface and a customizable home screen. That's reason enough for us to go hands-on with the app, mainly because we wanted to see if it can fill the vacuum left by Dark Sky's demise. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/28 7:20am PDTon Apr 28, 2020 and last updated 2020/04/29 6:00am PDTon Apr 29, 2020. </p>
<p> Not too long ago, the weather app Dark Sky saw its Play Store ratings decimated overnight after its acquisition by Apple and the subsequent scrapping of the Android app was announced. Another popular meteorological app is seeing a similar trend for its app ratings, although for entirely different reasons. Instead of improving the user experience, a recent major update to Weather Underground monumentally degraded the app by dropping several basic and prominent features. </p>
<p> Excellent weather applications are rare on Android, with many of them having documented privacy issues or poor interfaces. Dark Sky was a favorite among many, thanks to its precise forecasts and clean design. It was revealed last month that the Android version would shut down, following the parent company's purchase by Apple, and the Play Store listing has taken a massive blow in the days since. </p>

<p> Hot on the heels of Dark Sky's demise on Android, AccuWeather is testing a brand-new UI for its app. The latest beta comes with a more prominent 60-minute forecast and adds a bottom bar for easy access to hourly and daily forecasts as well as a radar view. The more modern interface and the focus on short-term forecasts might make the app a somewhat capable replacement for Dark Sky in the long run (though AccuWeather does have a history of selling user data, so keep that in mind). </p>

Dark Sky was a favorite among many, thanks to its precise forecasts and clean design. It was revealed last month that the Android version would shut down, following the parent company's purchase by Apple, and the Play Store listing has taken a massive blow in the days since. </p>
<p> Indie weather app/company Dark Sky has just been acquired by Apple. As part of the change, the company is shutting down its Android and Wear OS apps. Soon they will no longer be available to download, and on July 1st, 2020, they will stop working entirely, with subscribers receiving a refund at that time. iOS customers will be able to continue using the app. </p>
<p> Checking the weather is one of the features I use most on my phone. For years, I had a widget dedicated to just that on my homescreen, a layout I abandoned only a short time ago. When it comes to wearables, you have a couple of options in this area. Some watches come with pre-built faces that include weather info, you can build your own in something like Pujie, or install a separate app. Those who opt for the latter now have a new entrant to consider. Dark Sky has come to Wear OS, and it's a free upgrade for all existing subscribers. </p>
<p> Weather apps are a dime a dozen on the Play Store, but few are as popular or as religiously used as The Weather Channel's app. Over the past few days, the app has received an update that refreshes the entire interface and adds a few new features. </p>
<p> No matter how advanced technology has become, there's one thing that remains out of our reach. We can instantly access information wherever we are, enjoy any type of media content, and communicate almost instantaneously. But, no matter how good things get, we're still subject to the whims of the weather (at least for now). </p>
<p> Since we all have to dress to accommodate the daily forecast, you may as well use the best app for the job. Thankfully, the elegantly designed Today Weather is there to provide, and it was just updated with a new layout for the Note8 and pollen counts for the US. </p>
<p> Weather apps aren't exactly hard to find on Android. I don't think I've ever seen a phone or tablet that didn't include one by default from at least one provider, and dozens of freebies are available on the Play Store in varying degrees of quality and technicality. So why should users care about the latest one? Two reasons: first, it comes from Forecast.io, the company responsible for providing the weather data to a bunch of other weather apps. And second, it's one of those "hyperlocal" services that can give accurate forecasts "down to the minute" for very specific locations. </p>

<p> Weather apps are uniquely well-suited to Android's powerful widget system, but since there are so many options on the Play Store, it can be hard to find the best weather widgets currently available, especially since so few of these weather apps highlight their widgets in screenshots or videos. This is why I've compiled a roundup of my favorite offerings, and I've even taken the time to snap screenshots of the widgets in question for the latest update to this post, in order to provide everyone with a clear look of each and every widget. I've also added a new listing for today's update (Appy Weather), so if you're looking for a solid Dark Sky replacement, you're in luck. </p>

<p> Carrot Weather, an app that tells you the forecast while also being mean to you, is now in pre-release beta on Android. The jokes the app delivers are hit or miss, but with weather data from Dark Sky, a clean interface, and some pretty nice illustrations, it's very usable overall. </p>
<p> There are many weather apps to choose from, but the average ones are bloated, confusing, and sometimes even annoying. Today Weather, named one of the Play Store's best apps of 2017, strips away all the clutter and provides a great deal of information in a clear, elegant way. And to entice you to check out their new and improved radar functionality, you can get Today Weather's Premium features for $2.49 for a limited time, a $2 discount. </p>
<p> We all need a weather app. The tricky part of developing a weather app is giving users the right amount of information. Too much and it's overwhelming and a pain to use. Too little and users will be looking for that info in some other app. Today Weather, a new app from a two-person, independent development and design team, strikes this balance perfectly while being easy on the eyes at the same time. </p>
<p> Sunshine, a popular and unique weather app for iOS, is making its way to Android. The app specializes in providing useful, rather than detailed, information while crowdsourcing for more accurate weather data. While there hasn't been an official announcement from the developers, the app is now open for beta testing. </p>

<p> There are uncountable multitudes of weather apps in the Play Store, which makes Earth Networks' latest move all the more perplexing. The company has removed its popular WeatherBug Elite app from the Play Store, much to the chagrin of paying users. We reached out to Earth Networks looking for specifics about the removal, and have learned that there will only be a single WeatherBug app going forward, and it will offer an ad-free experience in the form of an annual subscription. </p>
<p> WeatherBug has been a big name in online weather forecasting for a number of years, and it was one of the first full-featured weather apps on Android. The problem, however, is that the app looked like it was designed by inebriated orangutans. Well, no more. The WeatherBug app has been updated with new features and a streamlined (not ugly) UI. </p>
<p> The new app has Holo-style tabs up top along with a drop-down for your locations. </p>

<p> We've been able to ask Google Assistant for information about the local weather for a long time, and your Chromecast's home screen has shown the current temperature along with a weather icon. But if you wanted to check out your upcoming weather, the only option was to "OK Google" yourself a forecast while you sit and listen through it. Back at I/O, Google announced upcoming contextual visual responses for the Google Home/Assistant and Chromecast, and now at least one of the features they showed off is here. You </p>
<p> Google Now's new weather card was spotted at the beginning of January then officially announced later that month. Ever since, it has been going on and off when you tapped on the weather card or did any weather search inside Google Now, and mostly never made it onto the regular Google Search results inside the browser (mobile and desktop - think when you open Chrome and do a normal weather search there, not through the Google app). </p>
<p> Long and tumultuous history aside, the modern weather card with the blue background, detailed forecasts, and funky frog, has gotten slightly better over the past month. </p>

<p> Ever since Google started allowing paid apps to temporarily become free, we've seen several major apps and games become discounted. We've already covered that HorseWorld 3D is free for today only, but now Weather Live and Etaria are also temporarily free of charge. </p>
<p> I have a confession to make: I love weather apps. It's not so much that I always want to know what the weather is (even though I do), it's that I just loving seeing all that information on one screen. Current temp, high, low, time, hourly and daily forecast - it's enlightening. Like so many other people, though, I don't just want to see this info in a dry manner. Weather in text form is boring - I want it to be pretty! You know, like weather is naturally. </p>
<p> Enter a beautiful weather app called Weather Live. This app has been exclusive to the Amazon Appstore for the last several months, but it's now in the Play Store for all to enjoy. </p>

<p> You can ask Google to tell you what the weather is, but it's not going to give you much in the way of details. You'll get the current temperature, a little image depicting whether water is falling from the sky in some form, and a basic prediction of what will happen over the next few days. If you want more, you're going to have to start clicking on those search results. </p>
<p> Or you can download a dedicated app. WeatherPro is one of the better options out there, and it's currently marked down to a mere ten cents. That's a good discount on an app that usually sits at around three dollars. </p>

<p> web </p>
<p> For a long time now, Google has been trying to make the web faster and more consistent for mobile devices. Earlier this year, it introduced Core Web Vitals as a new benchmark for making fast websites. Core Web Vitals has been playing a role in search rankings since May, and soon Chrome will use those statistics to directly label high-quality web pages, starting with how fast they are. </p>
<p> Even though many Google desktop web apps are already pretty capable and easy to use, there are always things that can be improved, and as such, Calendar on the web has received an update. It's now possible to add more details in the pop-up event creation dialog, and you can finally create fully colored printouts, in case you still like to see your agenda in a physical form. </p>
<p> In addition to voicemail transcription, Google Voice's strong suit is the ability to send and receive messages, check your voicemail, and even place calls from your phone or the web. The latter is particularly convenient, especially if your phone is charging or out of reach. Google has just made its app even more functional by designing a new interface that proves quick access to calls and settings. </p>
<p> Google began a Material Theme refresh of its desktop search UI last fall comprising tweaks all users see now, including a search "box" with rounded corners, more white, and a persistent search bar. The next step may be nigh, as the search engine is testing the addition of Material Theme icons that sit beside each search menu filter (e.g., News, Maps, Images, etc.) and are colorized when their corresponding filter is active. </p>
<p> Slowly but surely, all of Google's products are being updated to the latest evolution of its Material Design theme. The whiter, more rounded look came to the Google Account settings on Android back in the summer, and now it's now arrived at myaccount.google.com on the web. </p>
<p> I would have never thought that a single YouTube playback speed setting would be requested or would get noticed this much, but today I've learned that you can't make assumptions like this without researching them first. It seems that the 1.75x speed setting has been asked about, not once, not twice, not even thrice, but even more times, and when it showed up a few days ago on the YouTube desktop site, many users did indeed notice it. </p>
<p> I've been noticing it pretty much since I arrived in Germany for IFA 2018, and now we've had a few tips from readers to confirm it. Google's desktop search UI is being updated to more closely follow the latest evolution of the company's Material Design guidelines — this means rounded corners everywhere, more white than a snowstorm, and a persistent search bar. </p>

<p> Earlier today, our buds over at Chrome Unboxed spotted a new progressive web app by Google called Chrome Canvas. It's a very simple sketching/doodling app that works best on devices like Chromebooks with stylus-based input, but it will also run on your desktop or phone. The new app is showing up as an installed app on some Chromebooks running Dev and Canary channels, but you can pull it down manually on other devices right now. </p>
<p> After two years in development, the web-based Google Earth 9.0 debuted earlier this year. The new version runs entirely in the web browser, but it only works in Google Chrome. This is because it used Portable Native Client (NaCl), a technology that allows C and C++ code to run in the Chrome browser. Since no other browser bothered implementing NaCl, the Earth web app was exclusive to Chrome. </p>
<p> That is now changing, as the Twitter account for Google Earth revealed that Firefox support is in the works: </p>
<p> A few days after the release of Chrome 57 for the desktop, Google has started pushing out the latest update to Android users. This time around, Chrome has more controls for Chrome Custom Tabs, the ability to add recently-visited search engines, support for WebAssembly, and more. </p>
<p> Two days ago, Chrome 56 was released for Android with several major changes to both to the app itself and the web features it supports. As always, a new stable release means the next version - Chrome 57 - has entered the beta stage. Let's dig into the new features that Chrome 57 brings. </p>
<p> Most of the interactive content you see on the web (besides Flash) is powered by JavaScript, initially created by Netscape Navigator developers in 1995. As with the rest of the internet, it has grown and changed a good deal since then, but it's not perfect. JavaScript is a high-level language, meaning basic functions like garbage collection are handled by the JavaScript VM. WebAssembly has been in the planning stages for years, as an alternative to JavaScript for low-level applications, and it is now enabled by default in Chrome Canary 58. </p>

<p> Mozilla is working on a brand new Firefox for Android, but in the meantime, version 68 of the browser is rolling out on the Play Store. This is the final feature update for the current browser, and future updates will only contain bug fixes until the rewritten browser is ready to be released. </p>
<p> It has been nearly two months since Chrome 71 was released, and per Google's usual six-week schedule, Chrome 72 is now available on desktop and mobile platforms. This release doesn't have many user-facing changes, but there are plenty of security improvements and new features for developers. </p>
<p> Chrome 69 was a massive update, as it brought a brand new interface to both desktop and mobile. Now that v69 is on stable, the beta channel has been updated to version 70. This isn't as big of an update as the previous release, but it still has a few important improvements - particularly for security. </p>

<p> Mozilla is working on a brand new Firefox for Android, but in the meantime, version 68 of the browser is rolling out on the Play Store. This is the final feature update for the current browser, and future updates will only contain bug fixes until the rewritten browser is ready to be released. </p>
<p> It has been nearly two months since Chrome 71 was released, and per Google's usual six-week schedule, Chrome 72 is now available on desktop and mobile platforms. This release doesn't have many user-facing changes, but there are plenty of security improvements and new features for developers. </p>
<p> Chrome 69 was a massive update, as it brought a brand new interface to both desktop and mobile. Now that v69 is on stable, the beta channel has been updated to version 70. This isn't as big of an update as the previous release, but it still has a few important improvements - particularly for security. </p>
<p> Almost a full month after the beta version was released, Chrome 67 is now available on Android and desktop platforms. This version includes the long-awaited desktop Progressive Web App support, as well as a new experimental tab switcher and several new APIs for developers. </p>

<p> With Father's Day coming up in just a couple weeks, it's time to start shopping for gifts. Moment just kicked off its Father's Day sale with some good options that he probably wouldn't consider for himself. There are discounts on cases and lenses, of course, but you'll also find wireless chargers, camera gear, drones, and other accessories for 20%-50% off. And if you're hitting video chat hard these days for work, or just to call dad, you can even save on the Moment Webcam Set. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/04 8:50am PDTon Apr 4, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/29 8:13am PDTon May 29, 2020. </p>
<p> While you'd think that the world's webcam supply chain would have caught up with demand from the many millions of folks working from home by now, you'd be wrong. Logitech is still sold out of every model it makes online, and questionable cheap webcams popping up here and there on Amazon probably aren't a wise investment. But you do have a professional webcam at home, you just may have forgotten about it: your smartphone. With a few simple gadgets, you make your phone into a pro videoconferencing rig in a snap, and be the envy of everyone at the virtual office. </p>
<p> The ongoing coronavirus outbreak has led to massive shortages for some types of products. No, I'm not talking about toilet paper: webcams are now incredibly difficult to find, due to the massive rise in people conducting remote meetings. If you can't find one, look no further than Logitech's own website. </p>
<p> The Google Glass developers are at it again; they keep coming up with new ways to burn through that tiny battery. Today, the Glass Development Kit changelog was updated to detail the addition of USB webcam support for developers looking to add access to views outside of the standard forward-facing perspective. Webcams must be attached via On-The-Go (OTG) cable, and Plug 'n Play isn't supported, so Glass must be rebooted before the attached camera can be recognized. This comes a few weeks after a Google I/O session titled Innovate with the Glass Platform where Google Engineer Hyunyoung Song demonstrated a rig she had built with a camera mounted onto the back of a bicycle helmet. </p>
<p> Remember Piper, the crowdfunded home automation tool we featured almost half a year ago? Well the campaign is over and the gadget is on sale now. Once you get yours in the mail, you'll need to set it up and start using it, which is where the official Android app comes in. Piper Mobile is a free download, compatible with all Android devices running Gingerbread or later. </p>
<p> Piper is a little gadget that combines a wide-angle webcam and microphone with a Z-wave controller. The WiFi-connected box allows you to view your home from your phone, pan the camera and listen in to the mic, making it a relatively inexpensive security camera or pet minder. </p>

<p> Web client </p>
<p> We're all on our desktops for video conferences hours on end, but when it comes to hitting up all the people you need to without having to grab the phone you threw into a corner to avoid distraction, well, it's still a dilemma — especially if you use WhatsApp, where voice and video calls are still mobile-only features. But there are signs of a remedy for that need coming soon. </p>
<p> According to a report today from 9to5Google, a web client for Duo will be launched "in the coming weeks." When it happens, Duo will join desktop-compatible ranks of Android Messages and dearly departed Allo, expanding the reach of the service away from phones and Smart Displays. </p>
<p> Yesterday's update to Allo came with announcements that it now supports reactions (basically "likes") and that the doomed blobmoji are to be kept on life support in the form of a sticker pack. As meager an update as it might seem at first glance, it turns out that there are several other new features in this release. On top of that, a teardown shows quite a bit is in the works. </p>
<p> Tango, beside being a cool dance, is also a chatting application similar to WhatsApp, Telegram, Allo, and countless others. It may not be as well recognized as some of these brands, but it is popular in some countries around the world. And just like many of its competitors, Tango is now spreading from mobile to the desktop. </p>
<p> The Tango WebChat app is live at web.tango.me. You sign in by verifying your phone number and once you're in, you can chat with all your contacts and continue your mobile conversations from the comfort of a larger screen and more responsive keyboard. As someone who uses WhatsApp Web all day everyday, I can assure you that there's a lot of convenience in being able to do everything from your desk without having to pick up your phone to reply to each message you receive. </p>
<p> WhatsApp is doing something not so cool, but maybe a bit understandable in its latest beta version 2.16.86. When you start WhatsApp Web, you'll get a new notification telling you that the web client is currently active. </p>
<p> The notification seems semi-permanent. You can't manually dismiss it, but it disappears when you don't use the web client for a while, only to re-appear when you switch back to that tab in your browser. I kind of understand the rationale behind it: safety and privacy. Maybe you forgot WhatsApp Web running on a computer that you're not using or maybe you've stepped away from your computer, but someone else has opened your tab and started checking your conversations. </p>
<p> One of the hindrances of using WhatsApp as your main messaging platform, like most of us do in my part of the world, is that you're tied to your phone (or connected tablet). WhatsApp doesn't authenticate you with usernames or passwords, instead requiring a SIM card to work on any device. It had thus far been completely alien (aside from "hacked" solutions like WhatsRemote) to our desktops and full, comfortable, typing-friendly keyboards. That is in contrast to its competitors, Line, Viber, Telegram, and WeChat, which have all developed a desktop counterpart to their mobile solutions. But WhatsApp's lag might be changing, well, sometime down the line. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/web-domain/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17552103" filename="web-domain">
<p> Google has introduced a few top-level domains over the years, including .google, .apps, and even .lol. Last year, the company announced the .dev TLD, intended for use by software developers. Registration has been open to select partners since January 16th, but now anyone can buy a .dev domain — as long as you have $11k. </p>
<p> $25 Million. That's a lot of money for a little appendage that comes after a website's name. But Google saw potential in the tri-letter combo of .app and has finally won the ICANN's auction for the top level domain. This auction follows many other high-profile ones, where Dot Tech nabbed .tech for $6.7 Million (allegedly against Google), and Amazon grabbed .buy for almost $5 Million and .spot for $2.2 Million. By comparison, Google's auction has gone a lot higher, but it's understandable given the current interest in applications and our culture of Internet services. </p>
<p> However, this isn't Google's only top level domain — the company already has a few to its name like .ads </p>

<p> It might be overkill, but Weber's latest barbecue grill actually have their own app. The Weber iGrill app isn't satisfied simply remotely controlling the precise doneness of that $25 ribeye, though. It would also like to be your default browser on Android — though it won't turn your phone into a barbecue. </p>
<p> A few days ago, we heard unofficial reports that Google was disappointed with the performance of Music thus far. While it's barely been out for a full quarter to date, there have been a few major factors holding the service back. In my opinion, one of the biggest factors holding it back thus far is the lack of an API - or, in English: third-party app support for the service. Luckily, a developer by the name of Simon Weber read the post about Google Music and got in touch a few days ago to let me know that he had a solution to the problem: an unofficial API he's been working on. </p>

<p> WebEx </p>
<p> Google's been introducing a pile of ".new" domain shortcuts to its services in the last year, but first-party services like Calendar and Google Docs were just the tip of the iceberg. Google has opened registration for those .new domain shortcuts to third parties, and piles of services, including Spotify, Medium, Stripe, and Bitly, are already on board. </p>
<p> Do you or your company use WebEx for online meetings? While Cisco, the company behind WebEx, has offered native iOS and Blackberry apps for a while, Android users have been feeling left out. That is, until today, because Cisco just quietly dropped the WebEx Meetings app into the Market. </p>
<p> The app is free and allows you to join WebEx sessions in full-screen using free VoIP, a call-in number, or a callback to your phone. You can also access documents, apps and even participate in screen-sharing with live annotations. The app is multi-touch-enabled for quicker navigation, which I can say I definitely appreciate after trying to use some remote apps accessing large desktop screens without multi-touch support. </p>

<p> The brand new Firefox for Android rolled out to everyone last month, but it still lacks the broad extension support that made the original browser so popular. To quote Douglas Adams, "this had made many people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move." Thankfully, experimental support for sideloading any Firefox extension has now arrived in the Nightly branch. </p>
<p> Samsung Internet Browser is one of the few examples of OEM-designed apps that many people want to use over Google's equivalents. Ever since Samsung officially started supporting non-Galaxy phones, the browser has become one of the most popular for Android, thanks to its (minimal) extensions support, excellent dark mode, and fast Chromium-based core. Now the browser is adding support for even more types of extensions, but there are a few catches. </p>

<p> webkit </p>
<p> We often take mobile web browsing for granted, but sometimes the simplest of problems can turn it into a miserable experience. One of the early improvements to Android’s built-in web browser was a neat little feature that allowed text to re-wrap based on zoom level. It’s an obvious function, something that seems natural for reading more than a few words on a small screen. Unfortunately, a significant change in Android 4.4 resulted in the loss of this incredibly convenient capability for most web browsers and several applications. </p>
<p> Opera has been talking up its new browser entry into the Android world for a few months now, with a beta version hitting the scene back in March. That beta has now graduated into a final release, which just landed in the Play Store this morning. The overall appearance and functionality seems to be largely unchanged from the beta, so users who have been testing out the browser should feel right at home with the first stable offering (which is a completely new listing in the Play Store, not an update to the beta). </p>
<p> Man, WebKit cannot catch a break today, can it? After Samsung announced that it would be teaming up with Mozilla to build their own mobile browser engine called Servo, Google says its planning to fork WebKit to create a new project called Blink. Unlike Servo, this one will still be based on WebKit, but this new fork actually seems to be aimed not at competing with whatever Samsung is putting out, but rather at gaining freedom from another browser: Safari. </p>
<p> Get those fingers ready, Opera fans: the biggest thing to happen to your favorite mobile browser in years has arrived. Opera Software announced a new and retooled version of their browser in February, and demonstrated it during Mobile World Congress. The Opera browser beta (no Mini or Mobile here, it's the "full" version a la Chrome) is live in the Play Store. It's a free download for just about any Android device, so get to it. </p>
<p> Having your app unceremoniously pulled from the Market just a few short hours after it launches can certainly be discouraging, but the developers behind Kongregate Arcade didn't let that stop them from trying again. </p>
<p> Indeed, Kongregate Arcade has returned to the Android Market, albeit with a few tweaks intended to please Google. Most importantly, the app no longer downloads game data to users' SD cards; instead, the information is stored in the standard browser cache (Kongregate Arcade is actually a WebKit-based browser with some heavy modifications). </p>
<p> It's been but a few weeks since Opera's announcement of Opera Mobile for Android at their Up North Web conference, and now the browser is out there navigating the maze of tubes that is the Internet. While they didn't quite meet their "within the month (October)" promise, we can forgive them for wanting to polish things a little further. </p>
<p> However, glancing at Opera Mobile for the first time, your look might be one of the askance variety; "What's this? </p>
<p> We've seen Fennec (or Firefox for Android as it's now called) gradually progressing over the last few months, reaching a state of real usability in the last couple of weeks. There are many excited by Fennec's journey and the ability have a browser with near-full-desktop functionality, but it seems that even more struggle to see a place for another browser on their phone. After all, the stock Android browser is lightning-quick and works well enough for a pretty satisfying web experience. </p>

<p> Amidst news that Google has adopted a new logo (and everything that comes along with that), Sundar Pichai let slip that Google is joining the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix, and others to form the Alliance for Open Media (AOM). The organization's goal is to collaborate on open and royalty-free digital formats for "next-generation ultra high definition media." In other words, it will develop new image, audio, and video codecs and container formats that are totally free for non-commercial and commercial use. </p>
<p> The Alliance’s initial focus is to deliver a next-generation video format that is: </p>
<p> Interoperable and open; </p>
<p> Optimized for the web; </p>
<p> Scalable to any modern device at any bandwidth; </p>
<p> Designed with a low computational footprint and optimized for hardware; </p>
<p> Capable of consistent, highest-quality, real-time video delivery; and </p>
<p> Flexible for both commercial and non-commercial content, including user-generated content. </p>
<p> The moment we've been waiting for so many months - it's finally here! I can hardly contain my excitement as I'm writing this, but both Gingerbread and the Samsung Nexus S were officially announced 30 minutes ago. As expected, the new OS bears the version number 2.3 and brings updates to the SDK and the NDK as well SDK tools and the Eclipse ADT plugin. </p>
<p> As expected, a lot of the OS improvements are under-the-hood, which will result in better gaming, responsiveness, and overall Android experience. </p>
<p> New Features/Enhancements </p>
<p> OS/SDK/NDK </p>
<p> The new OS features and enhancements include: </p>
<p> enhancements for game development, including a new concurrent garbage collector, more native APIs, faster event distribution, updated video drivers, and new sensors (gyroscope) - this is amazing for developers; expect gaming to get a lot more responsive and versatile </p>
<p> lots and lots of attention in the above bullet point has been given to the NDK - the Native Development Kit. </p>

<p> webmaker </p>
<p> Webmaker is Mozilla's effort to make it easy for new smartphone users to make content for the web. Instead of creating something using WordPress or Blogger, people can throw materials together using a more simplistic interface. Webmaker has been available on the web since 2012, but now you can download an Android version directly from Google Play. </p>
<p> Mozilla is a champion of the web, and a core part of its mission has been supplying the open source Firefox browser. These days competitors like Chrome are eroding at its userbase, but they're doing so using many of the bullet points Mozilla emphasized—open source underpinnings, customization through add-ons, and speed. </p>
<p> Now Mozilla is pursuing its mission statement in other ways. One of the more well-known efforts would be the push to develop and sell Firefox phones. Another would be the lesser-known Webmaker initiative that empowers more people create material for the web and mobile devices. A beta version has made its way onto Google Play. </p>

<p> web Market </p>
<p> The Android Web Market just received a minor, but useful update in regards to app reviews. Now, when a review is posted, the version of the application being used and the device the app is installed on appears right above the text. In addition, any review can now be linked to individually, and when the link is followed, you'll be brought to the app's market page with the review in question front and center. </p>
<p> Google has responded to the alarm raised by an Android security expert of a bug related to the Android Market that could have caused a lot of trouble. The security hole was related to the recent implementation of the Android Web Market, and would have given hackers the ability to install malicious software fairly easily. </p>
<p> Co-founder and chief technology officer at Duo Security Jon Oberheide discovered the flaw last month and notified Google, who fixed it within "the last week or so." </p>
<p> As the results of our Friday poll show, quite a few of you aren't convinced by Google's official Android Market Web Store; it looks like a lot of people are sticking with good old AppBrain. Well you AppBrain fans will be happy to hear that one of the site's best features - Fast Web Installer - has finally returned after being disabled back in November of 2010. </p>
<p> Google's web-based Android Market announcement earlier this week was by all means no surprise to anyone - we've been waiting for it to arrive ever since its announcement at last year's Google I/O. In the meantime, alternative web-based markets, such as AppBrain.com, have skyrocketed in popularity because they allowed Android users to browse apps and games from their computers rather than being confined to their small phone screens. Even more importantly, alternative web markets had full control over app presentation, which allowed them to develop their own app discovery mechanisms. </p>

<p> It's 2012 and WebMD, one of the web's leading medical information sources, has decided to get its affairs in order and finally brush up its Android application to implement those cool holo design ideas that Google unveiled back in October 2011. Waiiiiiit. Checks calendar. Refreshes time & date. Checks calendar again. I'll be damned, it's 2015! </p>

<p> Having a baby is a huge task, and anyone who has been there can attest to the fact that there is a ton you have to do ahead of time to prepare - and many times more to keep up with after. Thankfully, there are many resources to help out, like books and magazines, but something a bit more interactive would certainly help things go even smoother. Enter WebMD's new(ish) Baby app, a comprehensive guide that compiles and organizes the relevant information from WebMD's absolute plethora. </p>
<p> We talk about a lot of different types of apps here at Android Police, but very seldom do we get to discuss an app that may actually save someone's life. WebMD for Android could be that app, and while I realize that may be a stretch, the possibility is still there. </p>
<p> This app really is an on-the-go doctor, as it offers a ton of extremely useful features. The symptom checker is a good starting point - it brings up a virtual body, where you tap the area that is troubling you, choose your symptoms, and then read about potential causes. </p>

<p> After many many leaks, we've got an official look at the Nexus 5 via the Play Store - the Nexus collection for the US is showing the icon for the Nexus 5 listing, along with the official description copy. Unfortunately though, the phone's actual listing is inaccessible. </p>
<p> So far we can tell that the device will start at $349 for the 16GB model specified in the listing's URL. This means the 32GB version we saw in the leaked manual will likely cost at or above $400. </p>
<p> Do you remember when Google and Yahoo! were similar brands? Both had search, mail, news, and instant messaging services. Sure, there were technical reasons to prefer one platform over the other, but it was all predominantly a matter of preference. Now, that difference could hardly be starker. One now manages not one but two operating systems, challenging the dominance of the likes of Microsoft and Apple, and has even planted the seeds for a gaming ecosystem that could someday challenge both handheld and tabletop consoles. </p>
<p> It looks like Google is gearing up for the Glass Explorer program, launching the MyGlass companion app and a new Glass setup page, both accessible to the general public. </p>
<p> The companion app relies on Google's now-signature "Card UI," and the listing's screenshots show off some of the app's functionality, though Google reminds us "if you don't have Glass, then downloading this will be a waste of time. Sorry about that." The description goes on to comfort readers, however: "But if you swipe the screenshots to the right, you'll see there's a picture of a puppy in pajamas. </p>
<p> Google's Mobile blog (as well as their Finance blog) announced an update to the Google Finance mobile webpage on your Android (or... iOS) smartphone. The changes certainly aren't subtle: Google has streamlined finance to appear very similar to all the in-browser Google mobile web-apps. As an Android user, you may be asking why Google bothered - there's already a Google Finance app on the Android Market. The answer? The website, simply put, is just a lot more awesome. </p>

<p> web player </p>
<p> Google Podcasts is already more than one and a half years old, but development is excruciatingly slow — not too dissimilar to YouTube Music. The podcast player has always been lacking an easily accessible web interface; it has only been available via Google search workarounds since March last year. Now, the company has finally rolled out a proper web version for a more complete podcast experience on podcasts.google.com, but it's still not on par with the Android app. </p>
<p> Google Podcasts gives us another option for listening to our favorite shows, but it's nowhere near as feature-rich as a lot of other competing services. Like a lot of early-stage Google products, it feels like there's some way to go before it catches up. The ability to listen on the web is a pretty basic feature that's been missing, but now there's a way to force this functionality. </p>
<p> If it were up to us, every video would be 16:9, with some exceptions made for some more cinematic footage. But because there are older videos and people unaware of vertical video syndrome on YouTube, videos with inferior aspect ratios are an unfortunate reality. The team behind YouTube is making the best of this situation and has now forced its web player to adapt to different aspect ratios. </p>
<p> I listen to podcasts on an almost daily basis (including the excellent Android Police podcast, of course), and for as long as I can remember, my app of choice has been Shifty Jelly's Pocket Casts. It's easy to use, has all the features you'd expect, and the design is great. The developer is always looking to improve the experience, and for me it, became a whole lot more useful once a web player was added. The beta of the new 2.0 version of it has just been announced, and it looks like a big update. </p>
<p> By now you may have seen YouTube's experimental new web player UI. The new interface has been popping up for some users for a while now, but if you haven't used the new player yet and you're feeling left out - good news. Today we've learned there's a way to enable the UI for yourself using a simple Chrome extension. </p>

<p> web play store </p>
<p> Usually, pre-registering to be notified of an app's release is a simple click of a button over on the Play Store, but for some reason, that usually straightforward process seems to have hit a snag. For many, selecting pre-register on a Play Store app listing doesn't actually appear to do anything. On refresh, the relevant button flips right back to say "pre-register" again. </p>
<p> It's been a while since the web Play Store got a fresh coat of paint, but it's coming. Google is in the process of rolling out a tweaked UI, after testing it for a few months. We're still digging through the redesign, but some changes are obvious. The screenshots are much larger, which is a long-overdue change. You'll also notice a myriad of layout tweaks and a new dedicated reviews page. </p>
<p> Lately, Google has been making big strides to bring the web iteration of its Play Store more in line with the Android app. The ability to report an inappropriate or malicious app seems like a no-brainer when you're running an app market. Though you've always been able to do this via the Play Store's Android app, you have never been able to do so via the web interface. A little while back, it appears that Google snuck this in without telling anyone, though the process is still more convoluted than it, perhaps, should be. </p>
<p> The "Flag as inappropriate" link takes you to a page on Google Support, where you then have to click a couple of extra times to eventually find another link to a web form for reporting malicious content. </p>
<p> If you're a dedicated gamer who's wary of the ever-present freemium model (or an Android blogger who's tired of reaching for his phone for every app in the roundup), there's good news tonight. A recent adjustment of the Google Play Store website will let you know whether an app features in-app purchases or not. It appears just below the Install button, right next to the drop-down list of compatible devices. </p>
<p> Google has officially launched the new web version of the Play Store, and it's a looker. The new interface is based around - you might have guessed - cards and sidebar navigation. I can't find a single page that hasn't been completely revamped. The new look is quite attractive, I think, and presents information in a much more clean, readable manner. </p>
<p> While functionally there aren't a huge amount of changes, the visual difference is stark. Everything seems to flow naturally as one big page as you navigate around the store, as opposed to a bunch of individually loading pages. The result is that most pages on the Play Store now load much more quickly than they did on the old site (well, at least for us they do - your mileage may vary). </p>

<p> web search </p>
<p> Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project is a decent idea, with not-so-great execution. AMP pages are designed to be extremely lightweight and load almost instantly, as a solution to mobile web sites being generally terrible. Sites have to opt-in to generating AMP pages of all existing pages, which Google then caches on its own servers for faster loading. </p>
<p> Google wants as many people to use the web as possible, because at this point it can reliably count on more or less every internet user earning the company revenue. Having a decent connection is a big part of that, and while there are plenty of adequate speed tests available, apparently Google wants one right in the search interface. To that end, they're testing an integrated speed test created with the help of Measurement Lab. </p>
<p> Google is continuing to refine what data you can access without ever leaving its browser-based search interface. A few of the more complex options for searching popular culture have now made their way from the desktop to Android, and they've also been given some impressive layout adjustments. According to Google's own search blog, contextual information for music, movies, and television shows will now appear in a dedicated sub-section of Google Search. Some of this was already available, but some of it's definitely new. </p>

<p> Google is pretty well known for building a fast and (usually) reliable infrastructure that can stand up to just about anything short a certain Nexus launch. This is why it came as no surprise when the tech giant announced its own cloud hosting service during I/O 2012, giving developers a path to tap into some of that power. Since the launch, Google has attempted to make its Cloud Platform product as appealing as possible, but the response has been fairly tepid. </p>
<p> Amazon's AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a hugely important web service that is responsible for much of Amazon's functionality, and plenty of content you look at every day (remember that time Reddit, Flipboard, Netflix, and others simultaneously stuttered in part of the US?). Looking to keep AWS account holders connected to their services and abreast of service health while on the go, Amazon released its official AWS Console app to the Play Store today. </p>
<p> As part of the company's continued international expansion efforts, Amazon is now announcing that its Appstore is available in Japanese markets. Not a moment too soon, either, as in a couple of weeks, the Kindle Fire HD family will start selling in Japan (December 16th). Without an app market, it would be an even harder sell than a not-quite-Android tablet is now. </p>

<p> The Appstore will be bringing paid apps (good news, developers!) </p>

<p> It has been around a month since Chrome 76 entered the Beta channel, and right on schedule, it has graduated to the Stable branch. The new browser is now rolling out on all platforms, including Android, and it's one of the largest Chrome updates we've seen in a long time. Let's dive right in! </p>
<p> Chrome 75 was just released earlier this month, and right on schedule, Chrome 76 has entered the Beta Channel. This version is fairly massive, with plenty of changes that have been in the works for months. Without further ado, let's jump in! </p>
<p> Slowly but surely, Chrome is trying to converge native and web apps. Chrome 71 came out a few days ago on Android, but one new feature flew under the radar — web apps can now appear in the system share menu. </p>
<p> The past few Chrome releases have only had one or two user-visible changes, with most of the work going into new features that websites can use. But Chrome 61 has plenty of both, most notably the new Chrome Home UI that is finally rolling out. Let's dive right in, shall we? </p>

<p> website design </p>
<p> Sidebars have been on websites long before Google introduced its first iteration of Material Design back in 2014. Since then, a lot of things have changed, but the company's condensed version of the sidebar has stuck with many websites over the years, most prominently Google Photos. It has also found its way into many other Google web services, like Google Play Music, YouTube, Hangouts, and even Gmail. Now Google has finally added this condensed sidebar to its Material Design guidelines and gave it a proper name: navigation rail. The specification is still under development, and it might even come to Android apps using tablet layouts in the future. </p>
<p> If you develop for the web, one challenge you always come across is how to make the best use of screen estate across so many different screens, layouts, and resolutions. It used to be that people only browsed from their computers which had a few limited screen resolutions possible. Now that number has risen, and with the advent of mobiles and tablets, the number of possibilities has gone up even more. Not to mention landscape and portrait orientations, which complicate things further. </p>
<p> Viewing what a site looks like on different screens simultaneously can make things easier on developers and designers, especially when they want to check out many websites and get some ideas from what others are doing. </p>

<p> web store </p>
<p> Like many less prominent tech companies' stores, ASUS's US storefront is... lackluster. Its design looks straight out of 2005, it's not very well laid-out, and using it just isn't a great experience. Thankfully, ASUS recently created an eBay store, and we're hoping that it continues to work on and add more products to it. </p>
<p> After giving us a sneak peek back at I/O in May, Google has finally rolled out the new version of web Play Store. The new UI looks totally killer, but there's a big shakeup in the features to go along with that new interface, and not all of it is good news. After the Maps update fiasco, it's starting to look like Google is pulling features it doesn't feel are being used by enough people. In the case of the new web-based Play Store, that looks like a lot of stuff. Let's go over what's new and what's gone. </p>
<p> One of the neatest things about the Play Store is that, as long as you're signed in to your account on the web, you can install apps directly to your device without ever picking it up. Now, Google has integrated this functionality into Google+. If a user shares a link to an app on the Play Store, that friendly blue "Install" button will now be embedded directly in the post. A-like so: </p>
<p> This is a nifty new addition to Google+. Of course, the embeds don't include ratings, user reviews, or any of the other key information that everyone should probably at least glance at before installing apps on their devices. </p>
<p> Opera Software, makers of the popular browsers for desktops and mobile devices, today unveiled a mobile storefront for web apps called the Opera Mobile Store. The store, which racked up 15 million users during its February beta release, is available now on Android (as well as several other mobile operating systems). </p>
<p> Applications will be purchased, installed, and run via Opera's mobile browsers (Opera Mini or Opera Mobile). Opera's store is powered by web app company Appia, whose storefront commerce system will be used for payments. An Opera Publisher Portal, a platform for developers to create and dispense their apps, was released simultaneously. </p>
<p> Android users have been clamoring for an official online Android Market solution for ages, and today, El Goog finally delivered with the Android Market Web Store. Once the issues with the "Sign in" button (clicking it returned an 'Invalid Request' error) were fixed, we didn't think twice about delving in and giving it an in-depth look. Read on for our first impressions! </p>
<p> Front Page </p>
<p> The front page of market.android.com (aka the Android Market Web Store) is simple, clean, and sexy - just the way we like it. Across the very top, there are links to other Google services (i.e. Gmail, Calendar, Docs, etc.), </p>
<p> Oh yes, those juicy rumors about an online version of the Market were true - the "Android Market Web Store," as Google is calling it, is accessible now via market.android.com. </p>
<p> As you can see, a list of featured/best selling games populates the front page, along with a list of categories, a "Sign in" button (which, at the time of this writing, leads to an 'invalid request error'), and a "Search" function. Once you click on one of the apps, you are taken to a page somewhat like the one in the second screenshot, with a description, links to "Overview," "User Reviews," "What's New," and "Permissions" on top, as well as a list of related apps on the left side and a QR code and a "Tweet" button on the right side. </p>
<p> When Google closed up shop at their now ghost-town of a webstore, Nexus One owners were left without an outlet for official accessories, particularly the elusive HTC Nexus One Car Phone Holder (aka car dock). </p>
<p> With eBay sellers demanding upwards of $200 (and that’s used) for a device that once retailed for $59.99, it seemed Google and HTC had hung Nexus One owners out to dry. But now, HTC’s US online store (run by LetsTalk.com) and its UK sister site are offering up Nexus One goodies, Car Phone Holders included, once again. </p>
<p> I, for one, breathed quite a sigh of relief knowing I could still obtain my Nexus One car dock without handing over what currently represents my effective life savings. </p>
<p> Tmonews has leaked a T-Mobile retail partner sales FAQ in which it is explicitly states that T-Mobile will never again stock the Nexus One in their retail stores. </p>
<p> This would seem to be the last nail in the coffin for the Nexus One’s US tour, though it is still sold abroad in the UK and South Korea. While the document doesn’t explicitly preclude the possibility of online sales, “The Nexus One was sold and marketed by Google” is pretty damning. </p>
<p> Also, this document is addressed towards brick-and-mortar retailers, and thus it wouldn’t be relevant to mention T-Mobile’s online sales policy. I think it is safe to assume, though, that you won’t be seeing the Nexus One on T-Mobile’s web store anytime soon. </p>

<p> Earlier this month HTC released details about their roll-out plans for its bootloader unlock process and the devices that would be supported. Today, in answer to some of the questions posed by HTC’s Facebook fans, HTC released an update on how the bootloader unlocking process will actually work and why HTC’s newest phones are still shipping with a locked bootloader. </p>
<p> As mentioned in their earlier post, HTC is continuing to make every effort to release OTA software updates within the month to enable unlocking of the HTC Sensation followed soon by the HTC Sensation 4G and the HTC EVO 3D. </p>

<p> webview </p>
<p> Chrome on Android has been a bit more crash-happy over the past few months. There were reports of WebView (the Chrome-based engine that powers web content inside apps) having problems last year, and Google has acknowledged Chrome 83 crashes on select Asus devices. OnePlus phone owners have also had to deal with buggy Chrome behavior, as the app has been freezing and crashing on some OnePlus devices for the past several months. </p>
<p> The component of Android responsible for rendering web pages inside apps (login screens, simple browsers, etc.) is the WebView. It became a separately-updated component with Android 5 Lollipop, and then Chrome started to handle WebView entirely in Android 7 Nougat. Starting with Android 10, Chrome no longer serves as the system WebView... sort of. </p>
<p> WebView, the component of Android that renders web pages inside apps (like login screens), is updated through the Play Store. This means that security issues are less of a concern, but it also means bugs can crop up outside of system upgrades. Case in point: an annoying bug is causing web pages inside apps to freeze and crash. </p>
<p> About a month ago we reported Google was working on a dark theme for Chrome, in preparation for a wider night mode throughout Android Q. Although this was a very anticipated feature, we expected it would only darken the menus and navigation bar but still render web pages in their original colors. This was before our colleagues over at 9to5Google discovered the browser is actually able to alter a site's design and display it in a darker skin. </p>
<p> There are cases when content can't be embedded into an application, such as a credit card payment verification, and developers need to direct users to an external page. They can do this by using the device's default browser, WebView, or Chrome Custom Tabs (CCT) depending on their need. None of these are ideal in terms of user experience, however, as they would either have limited functionality or show the site's URL on the screen. Google is looking to solve this with the introduction of Trusted Web Activities (TWA), which are essentially full-screen web pages integrated into an application, without displaying the URL or other browser-related interface elements. </p>
<p> Google has maintained a list of malicious websites, such as those hosting malware or phishing scams, for nearly a decade. The company's Safe Browsing API allows web browsers to access the blocklist, and show a warning if the site is dangerous. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, and countless other browsers use the Safe Browsing API. </p>
<p> As unfortunate as it might be, it's a given that using the internet extensively may compromise your privacy. Tracking codes that can follow you across sites have become incredibly common, often used to create targeted advertisements for users. At this point, Google probably knows more about me than I do. </p>
<p> Android has long provided a way for developers to show web content in apps without implementing a full browser with WebView, but the nature of this component has changed a lot over the years. It became Chromium-powered, was unbundled from the system, and then got a beta channel. Starting in Android 7.0 Nougat, WebView will actually be Chrome. </p>
<p> One of the less glamorous improvements to Android 5.0 Lollipop is the move to updating WebView via the Play Store rather than only with system updates. WebView is the component that lets apps render web pages internally rather than kicking you over to a browser. A recent update to WebView was crashes left and right, but now Google thinks it has that all sorted out. </p>

<p> Not all of the changes to Android 5.0 Lollipop are meant to be seen by regular users, but that doesn't make them any less important. One of the core components of the operating system is about to break free from the shackles of firmware updates and join the Play Store and Google Play services in receiving automatic updates directly from Google. As of Android 5.0, the WebView component will be a distinct apk, allowing it to be upgraded separately from the OS. </p>
<p> We often take mobile web browsing for granted, but sometimes the simplest of problems can turn it into a miserable experience. One of the early improvements to Android’s built-in web browser was a neat little feature that allowed text to re-wrap based on zoom level. It’s an obvious function, something that seems natural for reading more than a few words on a small screen. Unfortunately, a significant change in Android 4.4 resulted in the loss of this incredibly convenient capability for most web browsers and several applications. </p>
<p> This feature is perhaps bigger news for app developers than end users, but it's an important one nonetheless. Ever used an app that feels really slow, clunky, and unresponsive - almost like a mobile web page? It probably is one! You see, many publishers of apps out there don't actually build real mobile apps. Credit card companies, cell phone carriers, airlines - you know, the sort of companies you kind of live to hate. </p>

<p> webvr </p>
<p> It has been three weeks since the last Chrome release, and right on schedule, Chrome 79 is now rolling out across desktop and mobile platforms. This isn't the largest update we've seen recently, but there are a few changes worth highlighting. Let's jump right in! </p>
<p> Chrome 78 has rolled out to all platforms, which means it's time for Chrome 79 to hit the Beta Channel. This update is definitely smaller in scope than the last few releases, but there are still a few interesting additions — especially if you're interested in VR/AR. </p>
<p> Chrome has been able to view web VR content for some time now, but there has always been one problem - you couldn't launch Chrome from the Daydream launcher. In other words, you had to navigate to the desired page on your phone, then put your phone in a VR headset. That's not a great experience, and it leaves out standalone Daydream headsets (like the Lenovo Mirage Solo) entirely. </p>
<p> Almost a full month after the beta version was released, Chrome 67 is now available on Android and desktop platforms. This version includes the long-awaited desktop Progressive Web App support, as well as a new experimental tab switcher and several new APIs for developers. </p>
<p> Chrome 67 Beta is now available for Android, about two weeks after the stable release of Chrome 66. The main attraction in this version is WebXR, the upgraded WebVR API that supports augmented reality content. There's also a new tab switcher UI hidden behind a flag, and some other minor improvements. </p>
<p> Google Chrome 66 came out a few days ago, with your usual list of new APIs and user improvements. However, one major new feature flew under the radar. This is the first stable Chrome release with experimental support for Valve's OpenVR API, allowing VR content to be viewed on all popular headsets. This includes the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets. </p>
<p> The first version of WebVR was announced in early 2016, with both Firefox and Chrome being early supporters. The idea was to bring virtual reality content to the web, with support for all headsets, from Google Cardboard to the high-end Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. The standard continued to evolve for about a year, and Google loved to show if off. But in September of last year in an AMA, the Chrome team said the WebVR API was being reworked to, "support a wider variety of devices." </p>
<p> Google added an experimental version of WebVR to Chrome as far back as version 56 earlier in the year, and there were a handful of sample web pages you could take a look at to test out the various features. Since then, more demos have been added and other uses have also been toyed with, including the interesting VR short-film, Tabel. In a recent AMA, the Chrome team said they were re-working WebVR, and it seems as though that job is done. </p>
<p> I love music but I was definitely not blessed with a musical ear that's able to peel away layers and guess notes from one listen — a conclusion that took an excruciating 7 years of piano and keyboards lessons to get to. However, I am always trying to bring out the engineering mind inside me to figure out the exact way a song is built. That's why I'm fascinated by Google's latest experiment, Inside Music. </p>
<p> Using WebVR and in collaboration with popular Radiotopia podcast Song Exploder, Google has made a site where you can visualize the layers of 6 different songs in 360deg. </p>
<p> In all of the hubbub of yesterday's I/O keynote, Google took some time to mention a few changes and additions coming to Daydream and Tango, its virtual and augmented reality platforms respectively. While we got some interesting news about Standalone and WorldSense, Google has revealed more information about what we can expect from the future of VR/AR. </p>

<p> The Trump administration's prospects for bans on Chinese social apps TikTok and WeChat appear to be shelved for now. The shutdowns that were supposed to commence today —as mandated by executive orders signed in August — have been delayed. </p>
<p> As part of the Trump administration's crackdown on Chinese apps, the US government is set to ban all transactions with Tencent, the owner of WeChat, beginning on September 20. As that deadline approaches, the US Justice Department has issued a filing clarifying that it does not plan to penalize individual WeChat users themselves as part of the ban. </p>
<p> Amidst escalating border tensions between the two nations, India’s been on a banning spree targeting apps with any Chinese connection. We’ve already seen a couple of these rounds that took down some big names like TikTok from the Indian Play Store. With the latest update to the restricted app list, the Indian government has decided to pull the plug on a total of 118 apps, including the wildly popular multiplayer game, PUBG Mobile. </p>
<p> The past few months have seen a global crackdown on applications owned by companies based in China, almost entirely due to political backlash at the country, rather than concerns over data privacy. India has now banned over a hundred China-made applications, most notably including TikTok, and now the United States is following suit. </p>
<p> India has been attempting to reduce its reliance on trade with China for the past few years, primarily with the government's Make in India program. These efforts have escalated over the past few weeks, as India and China have been engaged in border skirmishes along the Galwan Valley, and now the India government is outright banning some Chinese smartphone applications. </p>
<p> The internet in China is different from the internet in the rest of the world. Services are heavily censored by the state, making it impossible to discuss unsanctioned political topics on the web openly. WeChat, in particular, is known to monitor and censor its platform in China. However, an investigation by The Citizen Lab shows that WeChat doesn't only monitor Chinese citizens, but also extends this activity to people all over the world using the app. It does that to feed its censorship algorithms, which helps filter out certain content proactively. WeChat essentially crowd-sources international users' data. </p>
<p> Version 1.4 of the Android Wear app started rolling out late Friday. The theme of this update, at least for what's currently live, is a set of changes to the Settings screen. There are a couple of new options, but they come at the expense of the battery stats screen. A look under the hood also shows that a few other features are either live or in the works for the next Wear OS update. </p>
<p> One of the nice things about sending traditional SMS messages is the option not to type them. Using the Google app (or an Android Wear device), you can just say "OK Google, send a text to Mom: Look Ma, no hands!" You can do the same through Hangouts and email. The feature is a life saver while driving, when messages would otherwise go unanswered. </p>
<p> Now you're able to use third-party messengers as well. Google has announced support for WhatsApp, Viber, WeChat, Telegram, and NextPlus. Just say "send a Viber message" or "send a Telegram message" in place of text or email. </p>

<p> wednesday </p>
<p> It's Wednesday once again, which means it's time for another round of app sales. Today is special, however — Google I/O starts today! So while you wait for the keynote livestream to start, you can pore through the list you'll find below. Both 10-cent Apps of the Week have been spotted, too. Be sure to go back to Monday's post to see if any of the items there are still free/discounted. </p>
<p> Half of the week is almost gone and we're back with some more app sales. Today's list is rather short, so be sure to go back and look at Monday's post if you haven't already. We also have the partner to the 0.10 app that appeared at the beginning of this week. </p>
<p> Half of the week is gone (or mostly), which means it's time for yet another round of app sales. The list is much smaller today than it was Monday, and some of the apps from that post are still free or discounted so be sure to check it out. </p>
<p> Feels like it was just yesterday that I was writing the last one of these, but here we are halfway through the week. That means another round of apps that have gone free or on sale! Quite a few have popped up since then, though there is still a theme that centers around icon packs and games. </p>
<p> Besides a dogfood version of Play Games, update Wednesday brought us a new version of Play Books - 3.4.5. The changes in this update aren't major (or even immediately apparent), but they are worth taking a quick look at. </p>
<p> First up, there's a brand new translation interface. Rather than a toolbar and sheet overlay, the new translate interface lives on a card, just like the existing notes and dictionary interfaces. Here's a quick before and after. </p>
<p> Left: Play Books 3.3 Right: Play Books 3.4 </p>
<p> Next up, new changes to notes. The ability to take notes in a book was present in 3.3, but users could not do that in a free sample of a book. </p>
<p> Cross one more item off your list of Google apps in need of material facelifts! Next on this bountiful Update Wednesday, Google Keep is receiving a bump to version 3.0 with some new material-inspired touches, the most obvious one being its launcher icon. Instead of a realistic stack of sticky notes, we now have a single dog-eared sheet of paper with a lightbulb cutout sitting on top. </p>
<p> Once you're inside the app, there's plenty to look at. There's a new search interface that (like Keep's web update) allows users to search by type of note (list, voice, image, or reminder), or by color. </p>
<p> It's been a long, hard road, but the Notion Ink Adam has finally been approved by the FCC and is going to start shipping "around Wednesday" to those who pre-ordered. </p>
<p> Although the product isn't yet available in the FCC's database, Notion Ink CEO Rohan Shravan has let us all in on the good news via the NI blog. He claims that the tablet's product code will be NI3421A01, where "NI" stands for "Notion Ink," "A01" means "Adam 1 Series," and "3421" is a string of consecutive digits in the Fibonacci series. </p>
<p> Rohan also informs us that pre-orders will commence within a few days (initially, pre-orders sold out shortly after they begun). </p>

<p> weekend </p>
<p> It's finally Friday! That means plenty of time to both download and enjoy new content from the Play Store. We've already seen some pretty great sales this week, but if you've already burned through them all, or just didn't find anything that suited your fancy, don't worry. There's a new batch of sales ready to get you settled in with a new app or game for the weekend. Check 'em out below. </p>
<p> Got plans for Memorial Day? If you're in the US, you're probably right in the middle of a long weekend. If you're looking for something to keep occupied, you're in luck – there are tons of apps and games on sale for the weekend. From utility-minded apps like Dropsync Pro to lighthearted time wasters like Cut the Rope Experiments, the Play Store's got some deals you should check out. We'll be keeping the list updated as we find more. </p>
<p> Much like keyboards (which we covered last week), browsers are a dime a dozen. Google ships one browser with Android (in more recent versions, that's been Chrome), which most manufacturers then replace with their own proprietary version. And then there are the dozens (if not hundreds) of third-party browsers available on the Play Store. </p>
<p> There's an absolute plethora of keyboard options available for Android devices - in today's poll, phones in particular. You can use the Android (AOSP) keyboard, the stock manufacturer keyboard that ships on your phone, or one of the hundreds of third-party options available in the Play Store. And if you go third-party, there are all different styles, from quirky options like 8Pen, to trace-based keyboards like Swype, and traditional predictive tap-based choices such as SwiftKey. </p>
<p> Android 4.2 is here, and with it comes proper support for multiple users on tablets. According to Cam, it's easy to setup and intuitive to use, too. Unfortunately, it doesn't work on phones at this point (presumably because of a Nokia patent). </p>
<p> The release of the Nexus 7 brought a new phone/tablet hybrid UI to Android tablets. And today, most people agree that it works well - on the 7-inch form factor, anyway. The latest leaks from the upcoming Nexus 10 suggest that Google will keep using that same hybrid UI, despite having a display that's a few inches bigger in each direction. </p>
<p> Complain as some people might, smartphones are getting bigger and bigger. Nothing exemplifies that fact more than phablets like the HTC DLX (or other variants, such as the J Butterfly), Samsung Galaxy Note II, and LG Optimus Vu II. Packing 5"+ displays, powerful CPUs, and 2GB of RAM, these phones aren't for your grandmother. </p>
<p> LG was hard at work this week pimping the new Lithium Polymer battery technology used in the Optimus G. Promising higher battery density in a smaller, lighter package, word's still out on how much of an improvement it is in the real world. Obviously, though, any advances in battery tech are welcome - more battery life is never a bad thing. </p>
<p> Let's say that the rumors (and evidence?)of a Nexus program are true, and Motorola, Samsung, LG, and HTC are all making Nexus phones for release before the end of the year. For the sake of our poll, let's just pretend that they are all powered by the same CPU, GPU, and RAM, and had roughly the same screen size and resolution. </p>

<p> weekend discussion </p>
<p> One of Android's greatest strengths is the platform's diversity, allowing manufacturers to customize as they see fit with their own tweaks and changes. Samsung fans, for example, often point at features that the company implemented first, which later trickled down into stock Android. While we're all probably familiar with most of the big headlining features from each company's software, what are your favorite lesser-known or underappreciated Android features? </p>
<p> Google has finally released Android 10 after six months of beta testing. As usual, Pixels have picked up this latest version, and the Essential Phone has continued its habit of timely updates. The last wave of OnePlus flagships also picked up Android 10, but only via the Open Betas. At the time of writing, Android 10 is still something of an exclusive club — have you updated to it? How do you like it? </p>
<p> Now that we've seen renders of both the front and back of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL (not to mention the previous renders and leaks), you've probably already come to some sort of judgment about the design. From the bigger square camera bump to the vertically asymmetrical bezels, there's a lot to like (or dislike) depending on your tastes. How do you feel? </p>
<p> With the next Android Q beta expected to be a release candidate, we've probably seen most of the upcoming features from Google's next big update. Even if you aren't adventurous enough to jump into the Beta Program yourself, you've probably seen some of our coverage on the subject — and if not, a full recap is here. We still have two more releases to look forward to, but so far, what's your favorite feature in Android Q? </p>
<p> Android 9 Pie officially landed just over a month ago, but we've been collectively anticipating the changes it brought since the first developer preview was released over six months ago. In that time, we've painstakingly assembled an extensive list of the features and tweaks Google delivered. Most of our readers probably know the details of this latest version backward and forward at this point, and so we're curious: If you could, what would you change in Android P? </p>
<p> Google I/O this year was absolutely packed full of exciting announcements not just for Android, but all sorts of stuff. From Project Soli and Jacquard to less exciting but much more practically relevant things like new Cast APIs, along with an absolutely slew of Android M features, there was a ton going on at this year's show. </p>
<p> So, what at this year's show got you most excited? There really was a lot, so much that we're still digging through it at all (especially in regard to Android M), so think carefully, and check out our feature spotlight series if you're not sure you're remembering everything. </p>
<p> As more and more Nexus devices get updated to Android 5.1.1 (and, in the Nexus 9's case, 5.1 in the first place), hopefully more and more issues people had with Android 5.0 and 5.1 are getting resolved. What I want to ask you is about your experience with the latest version of Android. Better? Worse? The same? </p>
<p> The Nexus 4, 5, 6, 7 (2012 and 2013), 9, and 10 [and Player] all have the update rolling out now with varying degrees of completeness, and factory images for all but the 6 are available. </p>
<p> So, let's talk. Android 5.1.1: what's better, what's worse, and what problems with 5.0/5.1 still aren't addressed? </p>
<p> This weekend's discussion should be one near and dear to all of hearts: our first Android phone. When did you buy it? What phone was it? Why did you pick it? Was it terrible? Great? Liberating? Life-changing? (Hey, you never know!) </p>
<p> Android is obviously a common thread for all of us, and our first Android phone was what strung us along to this point, reading (and in my case, later writing for) Android Police and talking about obscure phones and Lollipop and Google Play Services and tons of other things that many people have no freaking clue even really exist. But that's what makes a community great, right? </p>
<p> Smartwatches are easily the hottest new form factor in tech in the last year or so, and considering we're already on generation two (OK, maybe more like 1.5) of Android Wear hardware, you'd think smartwatches were pretty much a sure thing. Everybody's going to wear one, there's going to be a gigantic 3rd party app ecosystem, and it's going to be just like the smartphone boom years! Smartwatches will be indispensible to our daily lives. </p>
<p> Except, well, there are lots of good reasons to not believe that. Smartwatches have so far presented a pretty lame value proposition - doing little more than the smartphones they're connected to, while costing nearly as much (or a lot more). </p>
<p> We're back to discussion mode this weekend, and this weekend's discussion may require some thought. Increasingly, I've noticed an interesting side effect to the ever-larger smartphones we carry: people don't seem as interested in tablets anymore as a result. I know that when I'm using my Nexus 6, I'm much likelier to place that on my bedside table than I am my iPad for my morning email and reading, because it's a bit more comfortable to hold and type on, but still gives me plenty of room to watch videos or bang out an appreciably long email. </p>
<p> I'm not sure if I'd say I don't want a tablet as much as I used to, but I will say that I am much pickier about what I want my tablet to be as a result. </p>

<p> We already know which pocket most of our readers put their smartphone in, but based on a rather heated discussion at the Android Police workplace, we're curious precisely how you put it in your pocket. Does it slide in upside down, face against your leg, or do you flip it around a different way? How do you orient your phone in your pocket when you put it away? </p>
<p> This week's question comes courtesy of AP's Stephen Schenck, who expressed what we considered the curious habit of rotating his phone before putting it in his pocket — as in, placing it right-side up, with the charging port pointed down. Most of us at Android Police put our phone away more simply, placing it in the pocket as it's oriented when the hand slides in, upside down with the screen against the body. This division in approach resulted in some strong feelings. </p>
<p> Stephen's clearly psychopathic tendencies aside, I have to admit there are a lot of reasons you might put your phone in your pocket in a very particular orientation, like headphone jack placement. So what's your habit? How do you put your phone in your pocket? </p>

<p> week in review </p>
<p> Welcome back to the Android Police Week In Review, where we round up the 20 most popular stories published on Android Police in the last week. Without further ado, here they are. </p>

<p> Welcome back to the Android Police Week In Review, where we round up the 20 most popular stories published on Android Police in the last week. Without further ado, here they are. </p>
<p> Yep, we know - it's been a while since the last week in review post. But your weekly condensed Android Police solution is back, and better than ever. We're letting you, our readers, have a bigger say (in a way) about what makes it into the week in review. We're picking the 20 most popular posts published on Android Police in the last week and sticking them all into one big, categorized list for your convenience. </p>
<p> Welcome to the Android Police Weekend Poll and News Roundup. For last week's poll and roundup, see What Twitter App Are You Using? </p>
<p> As we near the end of 2012, the rumor mill for 2013 is already churning away. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal published a report on a Motorola 'X Phone' project being headed up by a former Googler, and I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm dying to see a Google-Moto mashup, especially if the premise is trying new and interesting things. </p>
<p> If you're looking for a Twitter client on Android, you won't be pressed for a lack of choices (just look at the poll options below). But what you may be pressed for is equivalent functionality, speed, and features across those various options. </p>
<p> Welcome to the Android Police Weekend Poll and News Roundup. We're introducing this as a combination of two previously separate features - the weekend poll and the week in review. Just think of it as the weekend poll with the added bonus of some stuff to read at the bottom. A Sunday super-post, if you will. </p>
<p> The Poll </p>
<p> Since the launch of the Nexus 4 and its glass back, there's been even more hullabaloo in the Android world about the need for a smartphone case, bumper, or skin. </p>

<p> India has been attempting to reduce its reliance on trade with China for the past few years, primarily with the government's Make in India program. These efforts have escalated over the past few weeks, as India and China have been engaged in border skirmishes along the Galwan Valley, and now the India government is outright banning some Chinese smartphone applications. </p>
<p> A photo on Weibo is making the rounds recently, showing off what looks like the back of the Pixel 4 in three different colors. We've already seen both the white and black versions a few times, but the photo shows off a new orange colorway which will probably end up being called "Coral," given both the text accompanying the leak and Google's documented use of the name for orange products before. </p>
<p> How many ways can you build a rectangle? When it comes to smartphone displays, it can get quite excessive. Chinese manufacturer Oppo recently revealed its work on a panel with a highly-translucent portion containing a phone's front cameras. Now, the company is circulating images and video of what it calls a "waterfall display" — basically a curved edge screen, but with the curves on steroids. </p>
<p> According to a promotional image published to the actor's Weibo account earlier today, Robert Downey Jr and OnePlus have entered into a marketing deal. According to The Verge, which was able to confirm some details with the smartphone manufacturer, the Avengers star's likeness will be used for promotions across Asia, especially India and China. </p>
<p> Samsung told us what sort of engineering went into making a Galaxy Fold possible. If you didn't believe what the company had to say, well, take a look at a teardown courtesy of a Chinese blogger and see all the moving parts for yourself. </p>
<p> For the past few generations, OnePlus's phones have been heavily based on those from sister company OPPO. The OnePlus 6 was based on the OPPO R15, the OP5T was inspired by the R11s, and so on. OPPO's R17 debuted last month with an in-display fingerprint sensor and a 'waterdrop' notch, and — surprise! — the alleged box for the OnePlus 6T showcases those same features. </p>
<p> We've been hearing about 5G-related things for quite some time now. The only thing with "5G' in its name that has officially been released is AT&T's, but as we already know, that's complete and utter BS. However, a Lenovo executive recently posted that Lenovo would have the world's first 5G phone. </p>
<p> Back in January, we got our first look at the HTC One X10. Much like the One X9 before it, the X10 is a 5.5" budget phone designed for markets like India. Now we have a better look at it, courtesy of a post on Weibo. </p>
<p> The Huawei Watch was many people's favorite Android Wear smartwatch back when it was released in 2015, and it remains so because of its round screen and 'classic' watch look. Huawei CEO Richard Yu has now confirmed on Weibo that the Huawei Watch 2 will be unveiled at MWC, following earlier speculation that this would be the case. </p>
<p> Yu doesn't say anything about the Watch 2, but shares a promotional picture, featuring a man in sports attire wearing the watch. Could this indicate the new model is aimed at the sports watch market? This would mark quite a change from its predecessor, although it's what VentureBeat reported on last month. </p>
<p> Third time lucky? The OnePlus 3 is right around the corner and as if on cue, leaked images of the phone have appeared on Twitter, courtesy of @krispitech (although they appeared on the Chinese social network 'Weibo' first). It unfortunately has a case disguising the looks of the phone, but there's still a fair bit on show. Most noticeable is a hardware home button, probably hiding a fingerprint sensor, similar to those on the original OnePlus One and the OnePlus 2, although this button looks chunkier. </p>
<p> The device looks reasonably large - it's quite possible that OnePlus has kept the same screen size and resolution - 1080p - from their previous two flagships for the third time running. </p>

<p> Based on the details of an FCC exhibits listing, Wyze may soon have a smart bathroom scale to add to its smart home gadget lineup of security cameras, sensors, and lights. The "Wyze Scale" will run off of 4 AAA batteries, connect to the Wyze app over Bluetooth, and measure both weight and body fat percentage. According to a report by Zatz Not Funny!, a Wi-Fi smart plug may also be in the works. </p>
<p> Last week, a fairly major update to Google Fit came with a fresh coat of paint for the interface and a few important feature enhancements. It now supports multiple goals with more options, weight tracking, new metrics, and quite a bit more. It wasn't a complete overhaul, but it certainly looks and feels like a whole new app. But that's not the whole story, there's actually quite a bit more in this update that hasn't emerged yet. A teardown reveals some other features that will either activate soon or turn up with the rollout of future updates. But before we get to that, there were actually a couple more things that popped up since the first post. </p>
<p> Intro </p>
<p> For the past 3 weeks, I've been rigorously testing Samsung's latest Android tablet - the Galaxy Tab 10.1, and I am happy to report that my verdict is now out. I hope you will forgive such a long review timeline, but I wanted to really dig in deep and get the full experience, all while comparing it to that of the Motorola XOOM. </p>
<p> I know a lot of you will jump to the Conclusion right away, but I urge you to read all the interesting sections as well - In A Nutshell, The Good, and The Not So Good at a minimum. </p>
<p> It's April 28th, the official release date for the 2nd generation Droid Incredible from HTC, and if you haven't studied this phone in detail yet, you're probably wondering just what exactly has changed since the original "Dinc" entered the market last April. Let's have a look, shall we? </p>
<p> Key Differences </p>
<p> Network </p>
<p> First and foremost, just like the Droid 2 Global Edition, the new Incredible 2 is a world phone with both CDMA and GSM frequencies. Verizon Wireless provides the following interesting numbers: </p>
<p> voice service in over 220 countries </p>
<p> data in over 200 countries </p>
<p> 3G speeds in more than 125 </p>
<p> Quite a step-up from the original already, isn't it? </p>

<p> weirdest phones </p>
<p> Smartphones, as a concept, have been reduced down to glowing rectangles that have grown boring. Why not have it take on a different shape? Well, the people behind the Cyrcle Phone have decided to take up the challenge, showcasing a circular phone at CES 2020. And from the looks of it, let's just say Android will be a tight fit on the thing. </p>
<p> The 10th anniversary of the first commercially-available Android device, the T-Mobile G1, is fast approaching. In that past decade, we've seen some pretty crazy Android phones enter the market - some successful, but mostly nothing more than cool design experiments. In celebration of Android's 10th birthday, we thought we'd organize a list of 10 of the weirdest Android phones of all time, sorted from oldest to newest. </p>

<p> Welcome </p>
<p> Google appears to be testing a new welcome page for its Chrome browser. The change jazzes up the previously boring, mostly blank white page with a splattering of colorful shapes, larger text, and bigger buttons — though it seems to be in a very limited rollout for the time being. </p>
<p> Last month, Google announced that it would be unifying its storage service under a new name: Google One. The transition from previous plans to better-priced One options was to take place "in the coming months," and reports of the rollout have been gradually spreading. If you're among those with a paid Google Drive storage plan anticipating the move, you might want to check your email, as some that have been welcomed into Google One are seeing a complimentary $5 credit hit their inbox. </p>

<p> wells fargo </p>
<p> When the Pixel 4 was launched last year, many people praised its fast face unlock system. It didn't do much good, though, unless it worked with the apps you used, and that wasn't likely at launch. Google introduced a new version of the Biometric API for Android 10 that worked with authentication methods such as fingerprints and faces, but it meant that developers had to add this updated API into their apps first. It took a while, but many bigger banking institutions are starting to support it, and now you can add Wells Fargo to that list. </p>
<p> Today Wells Fargo announced that over 5,000 of the company's 13,000 ATMs support NFC for card-free access. Wells Fargo customers can now initiate an ATM transaction with little more than their phone and PIN, no card required. This is in addition to the one-time access code ATM system deployed earlier this year. </p>
<p> Paypal announced in early 2016 a desire to return to the idea of NFC payments in the wake of Apple and Google's success. Earlier this morning, PayPal announced the ability to link it to Android Pay, so you could at least use your PayPal funds over NFC that way. Now Wells Fargo has announced they're rolling out support for PayPal customers to link and pay using NFC. It looks like PayPal has NFC on the mind. </p>
<p> Google added support for fingerprint readers back in Android 6.0. It has taken developers a while to get on board with that feature, and some are still playing catch up. Enter: Wells Fargo. The Android app has been updated with fingerprint support. Better late than never, I guess. </p>
<p> Android Pay is perhaps the most exciting aspect of Android Wear 2.0, but it has some caveats. It won't work if your phone has an unlocked bootloader, much to the disappointment of custom ROM and root users. Now it appears that some cards already compatible with Android Pay won't work on watches - namely CITI and Wells Fargo cards. </p>
<p> Samsung continues to push its Pay platform on every front, and according to the latest press release, it's working. The company claims that "about five million users" have used Samsung Pay to spend more than half a billion dollars. That's probably thanks to Samsung's unique system that doesn't require retailers to buy new payment processing hardware. A wide array of compatible banks, credit unions, and credit card companies probably doesn't hurt. Today Samsung announced that Wells Fargo, one of the largest American banks, is joining the program. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/wemo/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549344" filename="wemo">
<p> Belkin has produced smart home products for years under its Wemo brand, but Wemo devices have never had the best reputation. Most of its previous products suffered from connectivity and software issues, and when so many alternative options exist for smart plugs or internet-connected lights, there wasn't much of a point in purchasing Wemo products. </p>
<p> Thankfully, Wemo is starting to address its long-running software problems. The company switched to an online account system earlier this year, paving the way for a more streamlined experience. Wemo has also released a new smart plug, which is incredibly compact and actually works properly. </p>
<p> When it comes to setting up a smart home infrastructure, there's a bunch of brands to chose from. If you have a tendency to trust major ones more than unknown manufacturers, you'd be happy to know Belkin's Wemo WiFi smart plug, which was announced at CES earlier this year, is now available for sale. </p>
<p> Wemo's smart home products are far from perfect, with sometimes-difficult setup processes, tricky integration with third-party services, and an Android app that currently has 2/5 stars on the Play Store. Some of those issues stem from how Wemo doesn't have a unified account system, but the company is fixing that today. </p>
<p> For years we've dreamed of the smart home, but when we anticipated it, we didn't really picture a dozen hubs littered all over our house that do nothing but control only one type of device. Sadly, that's the truth we've come to. But Google seems to be taking the first steps to remedy this situation, starting with opening local control of smart devices to all developers and smart home manufacturers. </p>
<p> The Wemo Mini Smart Plug can turn virtually any dumb appliance into an intelligent, app-connected accessory that can be controlled from your favorite smartphone. Today, Wemo is selling its mini smart plug for the lowest price we've ever seen at just $16 ($19 off) for a single plug and $59 ($26 off) for a triple pack on Amazon. </p>
<p> Smart lighting may seem frivolous (and it totally is), but once you use it for a while, you start to see the benefit. An inexpensive way to try it out is with a smart light switch, and right now, Wemo's Wi-Fi-enabled switch is just $27.99 on Amazon, $22 off its normal $49.99 price. </p>
<p> For years, Taiwan-based Foxconn has been best-known for manufacturing Apple products, but it also builds countless other consumer electronics. Today, one of the company's subsidiaries (Foxconn Interconnect Technology) announced it is purchasing US-based Belkin for $866 million in cash. Belkin owns a number of major brands, including Linksys and Wemo. </p>
<p> With a couple of months of use behind me, my feelings about the Belkin WeMo switches are just as conflicted now as they were when I unpacked these. On paper, the idea of a switch that you can plug anything in to make it smart is fantastic. In reality, I struggled to find many, if any honestly, devices I wanted to use the WeMo with. But that's not even the meat of my issue with WeMo's switches. Their connectivity has been iffy at best, the app is laughably old, and integration with other smart home devices is hit and miss, mostly because of the aforementioned connectivity issues. </p>
<p> One of the biggest trends in consumer technology over the last few years has been the rise of the smart home. The number of different device categories that now make up the 'Internet of Things' (IoT) has grown immensely, with connected appliances now found in many households across the US and beyond. </p>
<p> The smart home was once an expensive hobby for tech-fiends only but has now become an affordable aspiration for normal people. You can get started for less than $30 these days, with some lights or a smart switch that can connect to your Wi-Fi network and be controlled with your phone. </p>
<p> 'Tis the season for things to go on sale, and sometimes more than one sale. The Google Home Mini is already discounted $20 for the holiday season, and Target will also knock $20 more off if you also pick up a Wemo smart plug. It's quite a festive deal. </p>

<p> wemo update </p>
<p> If you have anything from Belkin's WeMo line, there's a chance you may be less-than-pleased with the app – it is pretty basic, after all. Today's update, however, brings some much-needed usefulness to the table, like better integration with IFTTT, and a home security enhancement. </p>
<p> What's New </p>
<p> Greater flexibility when scheduling events related to sunrise and sunset. </p>
<p> New Rule: Away Mode makes it look you’re home even when you’re not. </p>
<p> New IFTTT trigger: long-press the Light Switch to trigger customizable IFTTT recipes without turning on the light. </p>
<p> Back in mid-February, Belkin released and early beta build of its WeMo for Android app. It was very light on features at the time (and only available for the Galaxy S III), but has been receiving updates ever since to get it up to snuff with the experience Belkin was looking for. </p>
<p> For those who may not be familiar with WeMo, here's the in-a-nutshell explanation: it's a family of devices – WeMo Switch, WeMo Light Switch, and WeMo Motion – that connect to your Wi-Fi network and allow to you control household electronics directly from your smartphone. </p>

<p> The planets have aligned: MeeGo, the latest operating system that will power phones and tablets and which you've probably never heard of, has just collided with Android, a mobile operating system made by... oh, you all know what Android is. Right? </p>
<p> Anyhow, the WeTab, which does indeed run the former of those two operating systems, will also be able to run applications designed for the latter, ie Android! It isn't clear whether this means that it will offer access to the Android Market or merely be able to run Android apps downloaded off the Internet, though the tablet will ship with an app store called the "Meta Store". </p>
<p> Another day, another delay. Recently, Fox Business News sat down with Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen to talk about their new Creative Suite 5 and the controversy regarding Apple excluding Flash from their recent software updates when he let slip that a mobile version of Flash on a variety of platforms, including Android, will be available in the second half of the year. </p>
<p> You can find full video here, but I've excerpted the juicy bits below: </p>
<p> We have a number of excited partners who are working aggressively with us to bring Flash to their devices whether they be smartphones, as well as handsets, and so companies like Google and RIM and Palm are going to be releasing Flash on smartphones and tablets in the second half of the year. </p>

<p> Fitbit's Ionic smartwatch was the brand's first product to feature an SpO2 sensor, which is used in estimating blood oxygen levels. Several other Fitbit products, namely the Versa, Versa Lite, Versa 2, and Charge 3, came with a similar sensor, but it had stayed dormant until December. After being tested with a few users, the feature appears to be rolling out more widely. </p>
<p> Didn't make it to Google I/O? Well, Motorola wants you to get a closer look at the Moto 360 smart watch anyway. In a two minute video demo, we get to see a few watch faces, notifications, and more. </p>
<p> Of particular interest in this video is the way the display works. When not in use, the Moto 360 display appears to be on, but very dim. So you'd be able to look at your wrist and see the time without touching it. To wake the display, simply press the button on the side or tap the screen. It's not clear from the video if the display will be completely off when you arm is at your side, but that has been the belief recently. </p>

<p> The Lone Ranger has been a real flop for Disney thus far, and I'm sure I know why. The company was late to debut an Android game to coincide with the release. Many of this summer's other successful blockbusters - Man of Steel, Monsters University, and Despicable Me 2 - all had games that predated or matched their theater debuts. While this form of marketing has never had any effect on me, it's apparently what the masses want, and Disney has since resolved the issue. </p>
<p> On paper, it seemed like a winning formula: take a bunch of cowboys, pit them against invading aliens, and see who comes out of it alive. Hot on the heels of a major theatrical release, GameLoft is releasing a Cowboys & Aliens game to the Market. </p>
<p> However, instead of the star-studded film (which, if you figure the $89 million earnings and $160 budget, was a huge flop), this game chooses to focus on the comic they used as source material. </p>

<p> If Prime Day shopping has led you to picking up some fun new gear, there's a decent chance you're also looking for some accessories to make the best of it. One of the most common add-ons you'll need for that new drone or camera is some extra storage. It will come as no surprise that Amazon has you covered there, too — microSD cards, SD cards, thumb drives, SSDs, hard drives, and even NAS systems in any capacity for any particular situation. </p>
<p> If you've been looking to pick up a few microSD cards, today is the day of the week to do it: Amazon has opened up its Gold Box and is featuring sales on a few SanDisk microSD cards and a lot of savings to pass around, whether you need 200GB or 512GB. </p>
<p> Since the Department of Commerce added Chinese manufacturer Huawei to its 'Entity List,' thus limiting its ability to import U.S.-made products, we've seen some of the company's most important supplier relationships take a hit. Alphabet may have been the vendor with the highest profile as many of Huawei's Android products rely on software services from Google. But chip producers, including one in Germany, have also had to limit their ties to the telecommunications company. </p>
<p> If you find that today's largest microSD cards just aren't enough for you, SanDisk has you covered. The company just announced the 1TB Extreme at MWC, a ridiculous amount of storage in a tiny, tiny form factor. It won't come cheap, though, ringing it at a staggering $449.99 MSRP. </p>
<p> IFTTT is a godsend solution for people who use different services and platforms and wish they could make them work better together. The idea of tying triggers from one device to actions on another is especially practical in the smart home, and even more so when you can use Google Home to control all those devices through IFTTT even if they don't have direct Assistant integration - yet. </p>
<p> With that said, IFTTT has just added support for 3 new products through new channels. </p>
<p> USB-C seems to get more widely used with every passing day - ASUS's new ZenFones all have USB-C charging ports - and that is no more apparent than when SanDisk, a major manufacturer of storage devices (until Western Digital acquired the company last month) announces new USB-C flash drives, with a normal USB-A port on the other end for convenient movement of files. </p>
<p> The new flash drives, catchily named "SanDisk Ultra Dual Drive USB Type-C flash drives," are faster (thanks to USB 3.1), reversible, and have multiple purposes, according to the vice president of SanDisk product marketing at Western Digital, Dinesh Bahal. While more and more smartphones are using the connector to charge the battery, very few laptops have USB-C ports at the moment, making a full-size USB a necessity, at least for the time being. </p>
<p> There are plenty of network-attached storage ("NAS") solutions available, however if you are a fan of Western Digital, you may be the owner of their My Book Live line of devices (available much cheaper on Amazon). Although reviews indicate that it is a solid product, it lacks a convenient method of remotely accessing the data, especially considering its MioNet solution is "nearly useless." Owners of this NAS will be pleased to hear that WD has launched the WD 2go Android app that helps bridge the remote access gap by providing an alternative method of viewing the content on your NAS. </p>

<p> Xiaomi has published its financial results for the second quarter of 2018. Turns out, as you'd expect from a company that recently became more valuable than LG, things are going pretty well for the Chinese manufacturer. </p>
<p> Continuing to expand its international Honor device portfolio, Huawei is bringing another previously limited-market phone to other parts of the world. The Honor 9 Lite, previously only released in China and India, is a toned down version of the Honor 9 and it is coming to Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and the U.K. for a mere €229 via Honor's online store starting today, February 6. </p>
<p> Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi recently announced it's intention to expand its business into Western Europe, and today the company hosted a launch event in Spain to celebrate this news. At the 'Change the Game' event, which was live-streamed on YouTube, Senior Vice President Wang Xiang took to the stage to formally introduce Xiaomi and its Android products that are being launched in Spain. </p>
<p> It wasn't too long ago that Xiaomi only sold its products within the confines of China, but over the past few years, the company has extended its reach. It currently sells devices in China, India, Southeast Asia, Mexico, the Middle East, South Korea, Egypt, Poland, Ukraine, and Mexico. Now Xiaomi is looking to enter Western Europe, starting with Spain. </p>

<p> CES is wrapping up (I left Thursday afternoon), so we figured it would be a good time to sit down and give all of you an easy place to find a bunch of the stuff announced that is related to Android. This post will focus on all of the television sets that will come with Android TV installed. I got see a few of them on the show floor, but they weren't all that exciting from a brief glance standpoint — we've all seen TVs and most of us know what Android TV looks like by now. </p>
<p> New TVs are a classic tradition at CES. A lot of the big and small brands take the time to announce new sets with some feature they hope will entice consumers to buy one. So how does a 4K TV with Amazon's Fire TV built in sound? If that interests you then Seiki, Westinghouse, and Element have you covered. </p>

<p> WF-1000XM3 </p>
<p> There are a few unusual things about the Xperia 1 II, including the super-tall display and the stupid name, but arguably the most unusual thing is the price. Back when B&H first put the One-Two up for pre-order, we were amazed at that $1,198 price, and thought that Sony might be reconsidering the price when the number was taken down. However, Sony confirmed that price a few days later, though it did mention it'd be throwing in a free pair of WF-1000XM3s for pre-orders. </p>
<p> The Xperia 1 II, with its 4K HDR OLED display and 5G-capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 865, is going to cost every penny we thought we would and a couple dollars more. Customers who intend on reserving a device in the month of June will find themselves handsomely rewarded when the phone finally ships on July 24 — yep, that's going to be a while from now. </p>
<p> Are you in the market for some wireless earbuds? If so, one of the best options around — Sony's WF-1000XM3 — is now just $198.00 from multiple retailers. That's $31 below the usual cost, and the lowest recorded price for the earbuds yet. </p>
<p> It's rare that earbuds get significant new features after launch, but Sony is doing that for the WF-1000XM3 true wireless earbuds. The WF-1000MX3s were already fantastic, but now they've gotten even better with Alexa support, volume controls, and more. </p>
<p> Sony's WH-1000XM3 over-ear headphones have been lauded for their audio fidelity and noise cancellation since they launched, but not everyone wants to devote so much space in their bag to headphones. Enter, the WF-1000XM3, a set of true wireless earbuds that promise a high-quality audio experience with active noise cancelation. The WF-1000XM3s are bulkier than most other true wireless earbuds, but you get something for that extra mass. These earbuds offer superb sound and effective noise cancellation almost on par with Sony's full-sized headphones. They're spendy at $230, but this is one of those times you get what you pay for. </p>
<p> When it comes to over-ear headphones with active noise cancellation, Sony's WH-1000XM3 are probably the best in class, but the Japanese tech giant hasn't yet wowed us with an equally impressive pair of true wireless earbuds. That could be set to change, however, with the introduction of the (also obtusely named) WF-1000XM3, coming next month for $230/£220/€250. </p>

<p> WH1000XM3 </p>
<p> Sony phones always follow the same pattern: they start off far too expensive in the United States, then slowly fall in price until they are acceptable purchases. Now you can get an Xperia 1 and a pair of Sony's WH1000XM3 noise-cancelling headphones together for $750, a savings of around $150 compared to buying the phone and headphones separately. </p>
<p> Sony just unveiled a new pair of wireless ANC headphones, the WH-1000XM4, which you can pre-order for about $350. However, the previous generation remains more than functional and is now about $100 off, at just $248 on Amazon. </p>
<p> Bose has been one of the most popular brands when it comes to ANC headphones. However, Sony has managed to dethrone the title with its WH-1000XM3 noise-canceling headset, which has been praised as one of the best on the market. Sadly, the device traditionally sells for about $350, which can be a roadblock for many. Thankfully, you can now snatch a new pair for just $230, which is $120 off the MSRP. </p>
<p> You've probably heard praises sung about the Sony WH-1000XM3 as a pair of active noise canceling wireless headphones. While its name is the bane of tech blog writers (including this one) and practically anyone with decent marketing sense, those praises do shine through. And you might just sing of them, too, if you grab a pair from Amazon right now at a good discount this holiday shopping weekend. </p>
<p> If you like your phones big, tall, and new, the Sony Xperia 1 might be your go-to. But man, that list price of $1,000 has never felt right, especially when we reviewed it and all the little annoyances and stumbling blocks brought down the sum of its parts. However, the 1 is one of Amazon's Deals of the Day today and you might consider this lower price a bit fairer... if you're willing to accept Alexa and Amazon apps into your life. </p>

<p> WH-1000XM4 </p>
<p> You're probably surfing Prime Day for some sweet tech deals, and audio equipment is no exception. Sony's WH-1000XM4s are the top of the line in Bluetooth audio, and their price reflects that — though today that price is a little bit lower. The XM4s are on sale for $298 ($52 off), plus you get a free $25 gift card from Amazon. </p>
<p> Sony has been making noise-canceling headphones for years, and it's gotten pretty good at it. We had very few complaints about Sony's WH-1000XM3 headphones, so there wasn't much to fix in the latest iteration. Still, Sony listened to customer feedback and made several notable improvements in the new WH-1000XM4. They still sound phenomenal, but Sony added wear detection, some new Bluetooth tricks, and made the noise cancelation even more effective. At the same time, the XM4s look almost identical to the last-gen headphones. They don't look ugly or cheap, but the design isn't as striking as I'd expect from the best noise-canceling headphones on the market. </p>
<p> Noise-canceling headphones are no longer rare—you can even get a passable pair for well under $100 now. However, Sony still makes some of the best over-ear Bluetooth headphones money can buy, and now Sony is ready to take your money for the new WH-1000XM4 cans. These headphones look very similar to the popular WH-1000XM3s, but Sony added a few new features, and improved noise-canceling. Pre-orders are up today for $350, the same as the XM3s at launch. </p>
<p> Sony's WH-1000XM3 headphones (above) are among the best when it comes to over-the-ear Bluetooth audio, and it looks like the successor will be launching soon. Just a few weeks ago, a teardown of the Sony's Headphones Connect app uncovered some features that the upcoming WH-1000XM4 would bring. Now, a listing for the 1000XM4 has appeared on Walmart's website. </p>
<p> Sony's WH-1000XM3 headphones are pretty much the gold standard for over-ear Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones, topping the recommendation lists everywhere, including here. Building upon everything Sony's accomplished (including the derpy name), details surrounding the upcoming WH-1000XM4 have leaked courtesy of a teardown of Sony's Headphones Connect app. </p>

<p> what </p>
<p> I've been told that smartphone enthusiasts are often a bit prickly about their preferences, though OnePlus is taking things to a bizarre new extreme with their latest campaign. Apparently titled "The OnePlus 5T Smart Tests," the first in the series features two men in underwear—one holding a OnePlus 5T, the other holding a Samsung Galaxy S8—having bits of cactus thrown at them, only able to leave after they open 20 "everyday apps." Truly, this takes advertising to a bizarre and unwarranted new level, and you should trust me on this because I live in Japan. </p>
<p> No sooner do we think we've spent a few good weeks without any major WhatsApp news than a series of updates to the app start hitting us left and right. Just after the last batch of Material Design changes went live for everyone on the Play Store yesterday, we got a new "beta" of the app on the service's website (also available on APK Mirror). </p>
<p> Version 2.12.87 fixes some of the last remnants of Holo in WhatsApp, materializing the calling interface, changing the default wallpaper to a nicer one, cleaning up the search bar UI, and removing those pesky Gingerbread icons that were forgotten under the More menu in a chat's overflow options. </p>
<p> In a story that makes flabbergastingly (yes, I'm making that a word now) little sense to me, Google is allegedly building a competitor to WhatsApp for emerging markets. That is, a mobile messaging application that combines SMS and internet-based communication in a unified, merged, and seamless platform. This does not sound like any kind of Google product I am aware of... said somebody who has literally never heard of Hangouts. </p>
<p> Apparently, the big difference will be that this new service won't require a Google account, which must be a nagging issue for consumers in emerging markets for some reason or another I frankly do not understand. </p>
<p> If you're a fan of the new slide-out menu that has slowly been making its way into all of Google's official apps and also like to watch movies/TV shows, today's your lucky day! Play Movies just got a sizeable update that not only brings said menu, but also a sleeker look and a couple of new features: </p>
<p> New layout and visual design. Watch Now provides quick access to what you’re likely to watch next. Personal videos now available via overflow menu. </p>
<p> Aside from the updated interface, the newest iteration of the app also brings a new feature called Watch Now that aims to predict what you're going to watch next and provide quick access to those titles. </p>
<p> If I were to tell you that you could easily insert the iconic Kool-Aid man into your pictures in one easy step, would your response be "OH YEAAAAH?" Then you, my friend, are about to have the best day ever. But stop smiling so much – your Kool-Aid-stained teeth will scare small children. </p>
<p> Like all red-blooded American males, I spend my days sitting around thinking, "Man, I sure wish I could play a button-masher fighting game on my phone staring the one and only Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson." Today my prayers were answered in a totally extreme way. WWE has released Rockpocalypse, with The Rock himself punching and kicking his way through 18 levels of pain. Did I mention it's extreme? EXTREME! </p>
<p> This isn't a wrestling game, despite being published by WWE. The premise is that The Rock is on the set of his new movie (a chart-topping blockbuster, I'm sure) when suddenly everyone on the studio lot starts changing into a raving lunatic bent on destroying The Rock. </p>
<p> Hi, everyone. I'd like to introduce you to the Samsung Muse. This is a music player with no screen and a mere 4GB of storage that requires a phone with music on it in order to sync. It costs $50 and is going on sale in the U.S. soon. Why is this handy little thingy going to be made available here? Because screw you, that's why. </p>
<p> 'What is this device?' you ask? It's a music player. 4GB of storage for all the music you can handle so long as you can't handle that much music. Also, you need to have the music on your phone already. </p>
<p> Well, you've already seen what gear David, Cameron, Eric, and Liam use. I suppose now it's my turn - though, a disclaimer: I like to keep things very streamlined. The less clutter (physical and digital) I have, the better. While I may not have as much stuff as them, the things I do use, I use more. </p>
<p> The Hardware </p>
<p> Desktop </p>
<p> There's no denying that my desktop is dated, but it's capable enough for my needs. It's a self-built PC with an Intel Core i5 750 CPU overclocked to 3.4 GHz, 4GB of RAM, a 1TB HDD, Radeon HD 6850, Sound Blaster X-Fi, and old Creative 5.1 speakers, coupled to two 22" monitors. </p>
<p> I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? LG? Making an interesting video? Pshaw, I say! Before you dismiss it, though, let me ask you something. Have you ever seen a phone built out of magic and diamonds?! No? Then I've got something new to show you. In this four-minute promo video for the LG Optimus G, we see a man who is, apparently, a sparkle bender, forge a block of pure obsidian, then literally carve the phone out of this block with telekinesis. And that is just the beginning. </p>

<p> what does this button do </p>
<p> Sometimes telling my own story is a challenge. So, after more than 5 years at AP, figuring out what to include in this post and how to write it hasn't been easy. But in the interest of eliminating suspense, I’ll give you the news up front: </p>
<p> I'm joining Google as part of the Design Relations team! </p>
<p> Android Police has been a big part of my life since I first started talking to Artem about contributing back in 2011. I won’t spell out the whole story here - if you want all the gory details I’ll tell you over coffee. But being part of the AP team has given me innumerable opportunities for new experiences, exploration, expression, and friendship. </p>
<p> Hey, did you notice yet? Our other site, APK Mirror, got an update a little while ago. Things are... different. The site's design has been updated, and that means we've made some functional changes too. </p>
<p> We considered renting an all-white studio and some film equipment to tell a heartfelt (and, frankly, heartwarming) story about the new design - about how subatomic particles are related to APK files, how we carefully cut each button out of aircraft grade aluminum, how each material sheet is thinner and lighter than anything you've seen before, or something along those lines. But I couldn't get the budget cleared with Artem in time for this post, so we thought a simpler overview of what we've changed (and fixed) might be better. </p>
<p> In case you missed it, the Google+ app for Android got updated recently to version 7.1. </p>
<p> The update is mostly comprised of bug fixes - 37 bug fixes to be exact - but it also offers fixes for 17 "accessibility issues," a fix for the "keep contacts up to date" setting, and one pretty handy feature that makes the bottom tab bar just a little more useful. </p>
<p> Google added the handy "bell" icon to the YouTube app's channel screens last summer to make signing up for "new upload" notifications quick and painless. But until now, users could only watch the video immediately, or take a shortcut to settings to disable the notification. </p>
<p> Recently though, it seems the YouTube app's upload notifications are gaining a new action - watch later. If you don't want to see the latest video from your favorite channel right this second, you can tap this new action to add it to your Watch Later list on YouTube. Here's a before-and-after shot of the notification: </p>
<p> Filed in the category of "things we just noticed" is a pretty strange interface element discovered in the "help" interface of Google Settings. When opening an article, users can tap a "full screen exit" icon in the toolbar to trigger the little floating window seen above. </p>
<p> The window is reminiscent of the one found in YouTube, where users can collapse a video and keep browsing, but this window can be moved up to the top of the screen as well. Sliding it to either side will dismiss the mini-window. Here's a quick video demo: </p>
<p> There's no doubt this element seems a little out of place in Google Settings, but my first guess is that, functionally, it would serve a similar purpose to YouTube's mini player - if a user is following step-by-step instructions in a help article, they may want a fast way to switch between the steps and the app that they're dealing with. </p>
<p> Something interesting is happening on the Play Store this evening. Users are reporting mysterious "Play Daily" and "Dogfood Apps" buttons appearing on the store's home and apps pages, respectively. </p>
<p> The Play Daily button - at the time of writing - leads to an error page (the app gets a 500 error trying to reach https://android.clients.google.com/fdfe/daily), while the "Dogfood Apps" button leads somewhat predictably to a special apps collection called "Google Apps for Googlers." Inside the collection is, well, a bunch of Google apps including apps from Google Samples like Pie Noon and VoltAir. Worth noting is that the Play Store is not dispensing actual dogfood apps from this collection, just the normal variants that are always exposed to the public. </p>
<p> In case you haven't noticed, there's a new button at the bottom of each post on Android Police these days. The green "subscribe" button appearing across from tags brings new Pushbullet integration to the site, and who doesn't love Pushbullet? </p>

<p> what has science done </p>
<p> For a lot of us kiddos back in the late 90's, Furbies were something of a craze. I know I had at least one of the retrospectively terrifying gadgets—though I'm at a loss to remember why, exactly, I thought it was cool. Whatever my youthful motivations may have been, enterprising hobbyist Zack of howchoo fame has turned our collective childhood memories into an intelligent Lovecraftian abomination. Meet Furlexa. </p>
<p> Video on your watch. Video... on your watch. Yup, it's a thing now. And not just any video, millions and millions of videos (at least 20% of which feature cats) on the world's biggest distribution service. Pack it in, NASA. Hit the showers, CERN. Go suck eggs, DARPA. There's no need to try anymore: now that we've got a YouTube app for Android Wear, humanity has reached its absolute peak. </p>
<p> Video for Android Wear & YouTube comes from appfour, the developer of AIDE, Gmail for Wear, and the Android Wear web browser. In that context this is sort of a natural progression, but it's still hard to think of the app as anything more than a novelty. </p>

<p> whatsapp </p>
<p> We're all on our desktops for video conferences hours on end, but when it comes to hitting up all the people you need to without having to grab the phone you threw into a corner to avoid distraction, well, it's still a dilemma — especially if you use WhatsApp, where voice and video calls are still mobile-only features. But there are signs of a remedy for that need coming soon. </p>
<p> Do you trade more voice messages than texts with your contacts? You may appreciate the ability to do that with the help of Google Assistant as it gains dedicated command branches for sending clips. That means you can even do it hands-free while driving! </p>
<p> Early last year, Facebook promised that it would create a unified backend for all of its messaging platforms. Messenger, Instagram direct messages, and WhatsApp are all supposed to be interoperable, so you wouldn't have to worry about which Facebook app to use with which of your contacts. It looks like the company is getting ready to make these cross-platform chats a reality, as it has started distributing a popup on Instagram that advertises a Messenger integration. </p>
<p> WhatsApp's search function has never been great. It does help you find your conversations and certain keywords if you know what you're looking for, but it has always only displayed text as results. WhatsApp wants to change that, as WABetaInfo and our tipster Moshe have spotted. The developers are testing an Advanced Search mode that helps you narrow down your results with specific filters, like text, images, videos, GIFs, audio, and more. </p>
<p> WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, but that also means a lot of misinformation and rumors are shared on the platform. Separating fact from fiction is important, especially with everything this year has thrown at us. Now WhatsApp is starting to roll out a feature that lets users quickly search Google for frequently shared messages to see if there's more info online. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/03/31 9:09am PDTon Mar 31, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/26 5:09am PDTon Jul 26, 2020. </p>
<p> WhatsApp has managed to reach a worldwide audience and break through 2 billion monthly users despite a severe handicap: The app doesn't support multiple devices for the same account. One phone number equals one phone or one tablet, that's always been the equation. And while there are workarounds to allow two different numbers on the same phone (for dual-SIM devices or Business users), there hasn't been any trick to make the same number available on two phones or tablets simultaneously. The great news is that WhatsApp is already working on this. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/27 1:10am PDTon Apr 27, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/11 9:25am PDTon Jul 11, 2020. </p>
<p> If you have a dual SIM phone, you already know the tremendous convenience the experience can provide. But for all the benefits, there are still apps out there that don't really recognize the dual SIM use case, like WhatsApp. Traditionally, using two WhatsApp accounts on a single smartphone wasn't really possible, but many phones now include built-in features like app cloning or work profiles that allow you to keep two instances of a single app on your device. Even if your phone doesn't have such an option, we've got other ways to work around this annoying limitation in our guide. Read on for more. </p>

<p> Last year, Google introduced integrations with WhatsApp that would let you start an audio or video call on the app via Assistant. While the feature is now widely available, the actual commands you need to use to utilize it are a little less than intuitive. You need to phrase things just so in order for Assistant to understand you actually want to use WhatsApp to make a call, which is mildly annoying. Fortunately, we've got a quick and easy guide to get you fluent in Google Assistant speak. </p>
<p> India’s biggest telecom operator Reliance Jio got richer by billions of dollars in the last couple of months with funds coming from left, right, and center. But it seems that instead of finding some good use for all that cash on hand, the company’s been busy cloning popular apps to offer its own alternatives. Last week, JioMeet was called out for being a Zoom rip-off, and now Jio is back with JioChat, which looks like a photocopy of WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Early last year, we got word that Facebook was considering cross-platform chats between WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger, running on a unified, encrypted backend. After the first small steps towards compatibility in the form of Messenger Rooms in WhatsApp, we now see this cross-app integration taking shape. According to WABetaInfo, a few hints have appeared in Facebook Messenger that reveal how the company is working on a way to contact WhatsApp users through the app. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/whatsapp-backup/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17553493" filename="whatsapp-backup">
<p> When you think about it, WhatsApp isn't the most intuitive messenger when it comes to moving from phone to phone. You need to turn on local backups or enable uploads to Google Drive and have to remember to back up before you factory reset your old phone, otherwise you might lose your most recent messages. And from a security standpoint, these backups are a nightmare, too — in contrast to messages you send and receive, they aren't encrypted. WhatsApp is looking to change that and is working on password protection for its cloud backups. </p>
<p> WhatsApp is a great alternative to the built-in voice and messaging apps on your phone, and it's especially handy for international travel or anytime you want to stay in touch while avoiding cellular charges. If you're a regular WhatsApp user, you probably want to ensure you have a dependable backup of all your texts and photos. It's easy to configure Google Drive to automatically back up your text messages, and sync incoming pictures with Google Photos. </p>
<p> Android developers have been able to use Google Drive to back up and restore app and game data for their users for a couple of years now. Android devices too have been able to back up some data like installed apps, device settings, call history, and more to Google Drive and restore it to the same device after a hard reset or to a new one when you switch over. </p>
<p> However, these backups remained mostly hidden in Google Drive. </p>

<p> WhatsApp beta </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/21 4:11am PDTon Apr 21, 2020 and last updated 2020/04/28 11:26pm PDTon Apr 28, 2020. </p>
<p> WhatsApp has supported group audio and video calls since 2018, but you have always been limited to calling three other people at one time. During times of stay-at-home orders and quarantines, that might not be enough to stay connected with all of your friends and family. An update to the WhatsApp beta channel improves that situation as it raises the limit to up to eight participants (including yourself) for the first few users, but it involves a server-side change, too. </p>
<p> Unicode 12.0 was officially announced many months ago, but the emojis and changes it brought have slowly been trickling down to different platforms. Google already implemented them in Android 10, but WhatsApp, which likes to use its own cross-platform designs, is just now following suit. </p>
<p> Whatsapp, which is used by billions around the world, might be upgraded in the near future to gain a new privacy-oriented feature. According to the folks at wabetainfo, the latest beta version of Whatsapp is starting to lay down the foundation for disappearing messages. However, the feature isn't live for anyone yet, and there is no promised and concrete timeline. </p>
<p> Just like almost any other app these days, WhatsApp offers status updates eerily similar to Snapchat and Instagram Stories. People who are into this feature have had the possibility to mute certain contacts (such as their colleagues) for quite some time already. However, muted updates would still show up in the status tab, greyed out but within a separate section below all others. The latest beta (version 2.19.260) is looking to change that with an option that lets you hide muted stories altogether. </p>
<p> Despite WhatsApp's near-ubiquity in my region, its Status feature has failed to gain much traction even though it's been available for over two years. Some of my friends love it and post multiple updates per day, but they're a clear minority. Yet, WhatsApp seems to think there's hidden potential in statuses and has already announced that ads would be coming to it in 2020. Another feature now rolling out in beta is the ability to share a status to other apps, most notably Facebook. </p>
<p> Back when I was six years old, a teacher showed us the image of an animal and asked us what it was. Several students answered "hippopotamus," and I was left wide-eyed and speechless. I was not used to being one of those who didn't know something, so the feeling stuck with me and I started working harder to avoid being as clueless as I was that day. If that incident is still imprinted in my memory, you can imagine that the hippo holds a special place in my heart too. My husband would tell you that I made him walk the entire Valencia Bioparc twice on our honeymoon because we missed the hippo on our first pass. </p>
<p> Move over, emojis and GIFs, stickers are the next hot item every social app or keyboard must have. As if we didn't have enough ways to express ourselves in our messages, there's even more pressure now on finding the right visual to convey our current state among a sea of potential sticker packs. WhatsApp is the latest messenger to join the game with its own sticker implementation in a beta release. </p>
<p> iOS users have enjoyed a neat gesture in WhatsApp for a long time that us Android fans have been denied: a simple swipe to reply on any message. For the past few weeks, this feature has been rumored to be coming to Android and now it's finally live in the latest beta. </p>
<p> Not to be outdone by Telegram's new "Mark as read" button on notifications, WhatsApp is rolling the same feature out to some users now. Not everyone is able to see this shortcut, even those of us on the latest beta, so it appears the function is enabled via a server-side switch. </p>
<p> Android 8.0 Oreo introduced one cool feature for app notifications: channels. Since not all notifications are created equal, even if they come from the same app, this would allow you to choose how different types of notifications appear, sound, and vibrate, or not, on your phone. However, that created one big issue: Google didn't have a fallback in place for apps that don't get updated to support the channels, which means that you couldn't assign importance to any notification coming from the app. That, as you can imagine, was very annoying with apps like WhatsApp where you couldn't disable the permanent WhatsApp Web running notification without disabling all of the app's notifications, for example. </p>

<p> WhatsApp calls </p>
<p> WhatsApp's voice calling doesn't seem like it has changed a lot since it was first tested as an invite-only feature then released to everyone in March of 2015. But the service, from my personal experience, has become more reliable, less spotty, with fewer delays and disconnections. Around me, everyone uses WhatsApp calls, because everyone is on WhatsApp to begin with, but also because local calls still aren't unlimited or cheap on any plan, not to mention the exorbitant prices of international calls. WhatsApp calls have almost completely replaced regular calls for us, and it's not hard to imagine that it must be the same in other countries where WhatsApp is popular too. </p>
<p> No sooner do we think we've spent a few good weeks without any major WhatsApp news than a series of updates to the app start hitting us left and right. Just after the last batch of Material Design changes went live for everyone on the Play Store yesterday, we got a new "beta" of the app on the service's website (also available on APK Mirror). </p>
<p> Version 2.12.87 fixes some of the last remnants of Holo in WhatsApp, materializing the calling interface, changing the default wallpaper to a nicer one, cleaning up the search bar UI, and removing those pesky Gingerbread icons that were forgotten under the More menu in a chat's overflow options. </p>
<p> Here's the news that the thousands of you who have been hovering over every update on our previous WhatsApp Calls post have been waiting for. The service's calling functionality now seems to be open, no questions asked, no invites needed, no hacks required. The only "catch" is that you seem to need version 2.12.19, which you can find hosted on APK Mirror or on WhatsApp's website. </p>
<p> Once you download the apk file and install it (make sure you have Unknown Sources enabled in your phone's Security Settings to be able to do so), you'll open WhatsApp and the app's UI will have switched over to the new one with the Calls functionality enabled. </p>
<p> You know the WhatsApp calling feature that has been rumored for almost a year and supposed to roll out by the end of 2014? Well, it seems to be here, a few months late, and with a major caveat for now. </p>
<p> Reddit user pradnesh07 has come across the feature by receiving a WhatsApp call from a friend. That's how the option is presumably activated for each user, in an invite-like system where you have to get called by someone who already has it enabled. Here is the app's updated UI and how the calling interface is supposed to look. </p>
<p> Pradnesh07 went on to call a few users too, trying to trigger a cascade of invites from his device. </p>

The developers are testing an Advanced Search mode that helps you narrow down your results with specific filters, like text, images, videos, GIFs, audio, and more. </p>
<p> Even though WhatsApp has existed for over ten years now, the messaging app still only lets us chat with our contacts. If you want to reach out to a new person, you need to first save them to your contact list on your phone, wait for WhatsApp to sync so that new name shows up inside the app, then start a chat with them. This usually takes several minutes and could often go on for hours if the contact doesn't sync quickly. </p>
<p> If you want to bypass this silly restriction and immediately chat with a new contact, there are several tricks for that. </p>
<p> If you try to look for WhatsApp on the Play Store now, you're likely to find nothing. For many users, searching for the app's name only returns WhatsApp Business, and the regular Messenger app has disappeared from both the Installed and Beta tabs under My apps & games. It is still accessible under its listing's URL though. </p>

<p> WhatsApp's recently launched digital payments system for Brazil has been suspended merely one week after its launch. The decision was handed down yesterday by Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) and the country's Central Bank, both of which are concerned about how it could harm competition with existing institutions in the domestic market. </p>
<p> For years, WhatsApp has been working towards launching its own payment service. While we always thought India would be the first country to see a full-blown rollout of the feature, it looks like Facebook struck a deal with Brazilian partners before. The company has announced that its bringing digital payments to WhatsApp in the Latin American country, powered by Facebook Pay. </p>
<p> For more than two years, WhatsApp has been working towards its own payment platform in India, and it looks like these efforts will soon pay off. As Moneycontrol reports, the company plans to launch WhatsApp Pay in cooperation with four financial institutions by the end of May. The service will be based on India's government-supported digital payment platform UPI (Universal Payment Interface). </p>

<p> whatsapp status </p>
<p> According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, Facebook has halted its plans to introduce ads in WhatsApp's Status feed. Talk of advertisements in WhatsApp, and specifically interspersed among ephemeral statuses, has been going for over a year, with the service's VP confirming that in October of 2018. But those plans seem to be paused, for now at least. </p>
<p> Despite WhatsApp's near-ubiquity in my region, its Status feature has failed to gain much traction even though it's been available for over two years. Some of my friends love it and post multiple updates per day, but they're a clear minority.

Another feature now rolling out in beta is the ability to share a status to other apps, most notably Facebook. </p>
<p> In what appears to be a server-side update to the service, WhatsApp has announced a new "statuses" feature today that really isn't about chat status so much as it is a rip-off of Snapchat's Stories (which was earlier ripped off by Instagram last year). If you know what Snapchat Stories is, you know what today's WhatsApp update is: it really is that similar. Take a look at the video and screenshots below. </p>

<p> Animated stickers have been available in Telegram and Gboard for a long while, but WhatsApp has only supported static sticker images so far. Be it through the app's few included packs or downloadable third-party packs from the Play Store, you got still image stickers. That's changing now in WhatsApp beta, as the app is introducing animated sticker support. </p>
<p> WhatsApp's developers suffer from a bit of a delay when it comes to updating their changelogs on the Play Store. Yesterday, they pushed version 2.16.262 (followed by 2.16.263) to the beta channel on the Play Store, but the changelog mentioned features we've seen in v2.16.230 like forwarding to multiple contacts and frequent chats, but didn't say anything about the new feature that was really newly implemented in 2.16.262: image drawing, nor did it say anything about the big emojis we've been seeing since 2.16.256. </p>

<p> WhatsApp Web </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/07/01 10:51am PDTon Jul 1, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/07 5:31am PDTon Jul 7, 2020. </p>
<p> WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, and it's only been getting more feature-rich thanks to recent updates like profile sharing via QR codes and animated stickers in chats. But the company isn't neglecting the basics either, and it's now adding a dark mode for the desktop and web. The rollout has started and will continue over the next couple of weeks. </p>
<p> A year ago, WhatsApp added picture-in-picture video playback in its iOS app. It wasn't until October that the feature made its way to Android in beta, then a few weeks ago, it rolled out to the stable version of the app. Now, it's making the switch from mobile to desktop, as PIP videos have appeared on WhatsApp Web. </p>
<p> Last January, Facebook launched WhatsApp Business, targeting small businesses looking to communicate with customers over WhatsApp. The app lets owners set up profiles with email addresses, working hours, and location details, along with a certain degree of automation: quick replies, Gmail-style labeling of conversations, and filters. This functionality had been specific to the Android app so far, but that changes today — WhatsApp Business users can now enjoy these features on the desktop and web app too. </p>
<p> We don't often cover WhatsApp Web here since it's not exactly Android, but it's related enough to the Android app that we do make an exception every now and then when there's something worth talking about. Today is one of those examples, but it's worth pointing out that some of these changes aren't new and have been there for a while — maybe even for a month or two. But again, we had to wait until there was enough news to warrant a post. </p>
<p> WhatsApp Web has been available for about half a year, and in the time since its announcement, it only got some minor changes like skin tone emojis. However, the service has received a backend update that adds a lot of the mobile app's features, making it easy for you to manage your conversations from the web interface without having to grab your phone. We don't know when exactly these changes were implemented, but they seem quite new to us. </p>
<p> First up, your profile photo and status are editable now. Simply hover over your photo and you'll get the option to change it. An edit icon appears next to the status and lets you share all of your feels with your contacts. </p>
<p> Deep breaths. It's happening. WhatsApp Web just went live. Wait, where did you run off to scrolling to the bottom of the page for the link? I have important things to discuss here, like the latest Archer episode. Literally. OK, OK, I won't stall any longer. </p>
<p> The web service, which we first heard about last month, has been officially announced on WhatsApp's blog. As the rumors suggested, it relies on the mobile WhatsApp application as the authenticator through a QR code authorization. It works for WhatsApp users on Android, Windows Phone, and Blackberry (and Symbian!), but not iOS. </p>
<p> One of the hindrances of using WhatsApp as your main messaging platform, like most of us do in my part of the world, is that you're tied to your phone (or connected tablet). WhatsApp doesn't authenticate you with usernames or passwords, instead requiring a SIM card to work on any device. It had thus far been completely alien (aside from "hacked" solutions like WhatsRemote) to our desktops and full, comfortable, typing-friendly keyboards. That is in contrast to its competitors, Line, Viber, Telegram, and WeChat, which have all developed a desktop counterpart to their mobile solutions. But WhatsApp's lag might be changing, well, sometime down the line. </p>

<p> what’s new in android 4.3 </p>
<p> Updates are rolling out to Nexus devices as we speak, but the public changelogs seem to only call for improvements to "Security." However, the latest round of commits just went up on the Android Open Source Project, bringing everything up to date with both JWR66Y (4.3_r1.1), which is going out to most Nexus devices, and JSS15Q (4.3_r2.2), which is destined for the 2013 Nexus 7. Thanks to Google's gracious sharing of the source code, we can comb through each and every little detail of what's new. </p>
<p> So, you want to know about everything that's new in Android 4.3. Every single change that's occurred since 4.2.2. Well, if you don't mind scrolling through a barely-human-readable, mile-long developer changelog, now you can satisfy that urge. </p>
<p> Al Sutton has posted a wonderfully-formatted AOSP commit changelog covering the changes from Android 4.2.2 (JDQ39) to Android 4.3_r2.1 (JSS15J). The JSS15J build is the most recent release of 4.3, and is the one currently shipping on the new Nexus 7. </p>

<p> what’s on my screen </p>
<p> Google Assistant has become quite notorious for its fickle features. One day something works, the other not. An excellent example of that is "What's on my screen?" which has disappeared and reappeared so many times we've nearly lost count. The last time it went away was in May of 2019, and now nine months later, it's making a surprise comeback. </p>
<p> Google Assistant does a lot of things. This invisible artificial intelligence residing (partly) inside our devices can answer all kinds of questions, control our homes, help us plan our day, play our favorite music, and, with the addition of features like What's on my screen and Google Lens, glean more from what we're looking at and provide contextual answers. What you may not be aware of, and something I recently discovered (though it isn't very new), is that Assistant can read your screen even when you don't explicitly ask it what's on your screen. That has the potential to be very handy, but also extremely creepy if you didn't know it was possible. </p>
<p> Long before Google Lens could be used to understand text and objects in photos you take, a feature called Now on Tap was introduced to analyze what was on your screen and bring you relevant search results relating to what it found. Of course, Google Now is no longer, and Now on Tap has morphed into a screen search function as part of the Google Assistant. It appears to be broken for some people at the moment, however. </p>

<p> what’s really new </p>
<p> Have issues with the Nexus 5 or Android 4.4 KitKat (we know you do)? Well, Google has iterated its way out of many of those issues while also polishing a few other things, rolling out Android 4.4.2 recently. We had actually been working on What's Really New in Android 4.4.1, but with the update to 4.4.2 close on its heels, we'll be discussing changes from both updates. </p>
<p> The hallmark of the 4.4.1 update, as described by Google, is camera enhancement for the Nexus 5. </p>
<p> Now that the insane week of Google app updates has passed (gotta love those Rollout Wednesdays, right?), I've had some time to dig into the APKs and have found a number of interesting things in some of them. </p>
<p> We'll start with Gmail, which received a fairly significant Card UI update with version 4.6. </p>
<p> Ads are coming to Gmail </p>
<p> The most significant under-the-hood and probably not active yet addition to Gmail 4.6 is ads. </p>
<p> Hello and welcome to a new feature! I'm going to start calling this "What's Really New," the series where we do more than just post a change log with the canned screenshots when something important gets updated. We're going in-depth (as usual). We'll be ripping apart APKs, doing full side-by-side comparisons, and, hopefully, letting you know about all the cool new stuff before it comes out. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/whats-this-song/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17560563" filename="whats-this-song">
<p> Google Search has long been able to identify songs playing nearby. After waiting anxiously for it to arrive, it finally rolled out for Google Assistant in 2017. Now Google's music identifying capabilities are getting an upgrade: finding the song stuck on the tip of your tongue is now as easy as humming into your phone. </p>
<p> Deezer has been testing SongCatcher, its in-app music recognition tool for several months, and now it's ready to launch it for all Android users. Later today, starting 3pm CET (in about 3 hours at the time of writing), the functionality should be live for everyone using the Android Deezer app. </p>
<p> We don't distribute "finally" in titles gratuitously. In order for a piece of news to earn its "finally," it has to be a popular request and one that's been long in the making and, more often than not, it has to be so logical that its absence baffled us. But today, we have a much-earned "finally" for song search on Assistant. </p>
<p> One of the most beloved features of Google Search has long been asking it what's playing to identify songs around you. It works like Shazam or SoundHound, but without requiring a third-party app. When Google introduced Assistant, everyone was disappointed to see what the command didn't work. </p>
<p> If you're on the list for beta updates to the Google app, a new version should have rolled out to you in the last day or so. We haven't seen any new features or notable changes yet, but there are quite a few interesting bits worthy of a teardown. There's a sign that rumors about an "Assistant" key on some new Chromebooks may be true and we may finally get to ask the Assistant to name songs again, among other things. As usual, we've got the apk linked at the bottom if you'd like to pick it up without waiting for an update to hit your device. </p>
<p> One of the new features that ships with Jelly Bean is Google's Sound Search widget that helps identify songs after listening to short samples. If you've ever used SoundHound or Shazam, you know exactly what this does. The difference is this widget is pre-installed on Jelly Bean, comes directly from Google, and hooks right into Google Play. </p>
<p> As it turns out, the widget works on ICS as well. I looked into the package and saw that compatibility goes back as far as Honeycomb, so I'm guessing it will install there too (sorry, no Gingerbread or below). I, however, don't have Honeycomb devices left anymore, so I have tested it on the EVO LTE running ICS, and it worked like a charm. </p>

<p> what to expect </p>
<p> We're just a week out from Google's October 15th hardware event, at which the company is expected to announce a pile of products, including the much-leaked Pixel 4. But there will be more to the next Made by Google event than just a new phone, plenty of other hardware (and software) is expected to land. Let's work through the list so that you know what to expect. </p>
<p> Google's yearly hardware event is nearly upon us. In this day and age, there are always bits of information leaked ahead of official announcements, but this event is completely different. Google has been as leaky as the Titanic over the past few months, so there's a good chance there aren't any surprises left. </p>
<p> If you've been living under a rock this whole time, or you haven't been able to keep track of all the leaks, we've summarized everything we know about the products Google will (probably) announce tomorrow. </p>
<p> After seeing a deluge of rumors, leaks, and hoax after hoax this season, it looks like we're finally starting to wind down. With Google's Android event a mere 8 days away, it's time to clear away the muck and take a look at what we expect to make an appearance just a couple days before Halloween. Let's start with the stuff we're most confident in and work our way down, shall we? </p>
<p> Android 4.2 Jelly Bean </p>
<p> We were already fairly confident that the next version of Android would not be 5.0. While Google is inconsistent with its naming and number scheme, The company does tend to at least save full number releases for big changes (2.0 brought a huge face lift, Navigation and the Droid, 3.0 introduced tablets, 4.0 brought tablets and phones together under the biggest UI change yet). </p>

<p> what we run </p>
<p> I love gadgets. I remember wandering around the electronics store, checking the specs on every portable radio cassette player, and drooling over an Aiwa one that could play both sides of the tape without requiring manual flipping. I was also the 14-year-old girl who went to the computer shop and had a list of every spec she wanted in her first computer. </p>
<p> Now in my (very) late twenties, that passion hasn't subsided. </p>
<p> When it came time to think about writing a “What We Use” post last year, I was still somewhat new to the AP team and I had just learned that I was about to be the new Teardown guy, so I took a pass on attempting to compile my entire toolset in a single article. I can’t say that I’m any more prepared to do one this year, but I couldn’t resist joining in on the fun. </p>
<p> As Cameron explained in his latest "What We Use" entry, technology can change a lot in just one year. Around this time last year, I was running with a 2012 Nexus 7, a Galaxy Tab 10.1, and an Evo LTE. All of those devices have changed since then, as have my favorite apps and other gadgets. The family of devices I use has grown and evolved significantly since last October, so I thought it may be fun to detail just what I use to get through a normal day. </p>
<p> With another week comes another entry in our new "What We Use" series. This time it's my turn. I may not have an eternal turtle or a crazy-sophisticated head razor, but the fourth time's a charm, right? Here's a rundown of the hardware, software, and miscellaneous whatnots that help me do what I do. </p>
<p> The Hardware </p>
<p> My Laptop </p>
<p> Unlike my colleagues, I rely primarily on my laptop. Having found myself either in class or overseas during the past four years, re-upping my old desktop build was neither cost-effective nor practical, so I opted for a beefy laptop solution. </p>
<p> Last week, we gave you a glimpse into what David uses: his favorite gadgets, accessories, apps, and all the other tech junk that he doesn't go a day without. Now it's my turn. With this series, you'll see how different each member of the AP team is when it comes to how we use our gear, which is one of the best things about Android: it's versatile. </p>
<p> Since David's already done the legwork of explaining what "What we use" is all about, I'm just going to jump right in. </p>
<p> We've been ruminating on the idea of a series like this for a while at Android Police, and today, we're finally taking the plunge. Want to know the Android apps, tools, and hardware the editors of Android Police use day to day? Now you can! I mean, if you want to know. We won't be offended if you don't. Promise. </p>
<p> So, how's this going to work? We're going to start with hardware, then get into apps. </p>

<p> what we use </p>
<p> It has been a year and a half since my last 'What We Use' post, where I explained what technology and products I used on a regular basis. Nearly every aspect of that post is now out of date — in my never-ending quest to find what devices, services, and applications are best for me, my arsenal of technology has completely changed. </p>
<p> I've upgraded my desktop, switched phones, bought and sold two laptops, and purchased a car. Like all 'What We Use' posts from the AP staff, this is mostly an opportunity for me to ramble about technology I like. </p>
<p> I spend my days writing about technology, and I spend much of my remaining time playing with it for fun. Consequently, I have a lot of nerdy stuff that's become integral to my life, and maybe you're interested in what it all is. It's been almost two years since I did a "what we use" post, and a lot has changed. My preferred phones are different, of course, but I've fallen deep down the mechanical keyboard rabbit hole, too. Events have also conspired against me to require that I build a new desktop computer. Here are all the things (mostly keyboards) that I can't live without. </p>
<p> So here we are already elbows-deep into 2017. Let me start off by saying that I love this job — I work with and I have met some great and intelligent people. By some miracle, I have earned the "right" to write up one of these posts. Now is your chance to see into the other side of your screen to get a glimpse of how I bring you such profound content. </p>
<p> You may recall Android Police's long-running 'What We Use' series, where the fantastic people that work here share the tech (and sometimes non-tech) products they use on a frequent basis. </p>
<p> I haven't actually written one of these posts yet - simply because I only joined AP last year. I've had a fascination with technology as long as I can remember, but my arsenal of toys is constantly changing. So without further ado, this is what I use. </p>
<p> This week's Android Police podcast is a bit different - it's all about stuff! As in, the stuff we use. We take a full episode to just talk about the various tools, gadgets, gizmos, and toys that we like. We do these kinds of posts on the site, so we figured why not an episode of the podcast? We've got some select items featured on the show that you can buy below, too. </p>
<p> When I was in my 20s, I was all about tinkering with things. I strived to always be at maximum geekiness. I built my own computers, it was Windows and Linux all the way, it was all about how much I could squeeze out of my tech. Then I got older. I'm 36 now, and as time has gone on, I've moved away from all that. These days, I prefer my tech to just work and actually allow me to get stuff done. I don't really care about the inner workings of things as much as I used to, or how much geek cred a particular piece of tech gives me. </p>
<p> My first computer was an old laptop with a dead battery and a dial-up modem. It ran Windows XP, but I didn't have the money to buy expensive software like Microsoft Office or PhotoShop. I discovered OpenOffice.org, AbiWord, and GIMP. I used Firefox, Thunderbird, and Pidgin. </p>
<p> Back then free cloud services weren't yet around, and I didn't have a strong enough Internet connection even if they were. Without an understanding of what open source software was, such applications gradually formed the majority of what I used. When I later went to college, I embraced Linux, and my appreciation for open source software grew. </p>
<p> I consider myself quite lucky to be able to make a living writing things on the internet because it gives me an outlet for my natural geekery. Even if I had never started crafting snarky blog posts on a daily basis, I suspect many of the things on this list would still be in my office (I guess then I'd call it something else). However, in this version of reality, I'm a professional nerd, and these are the things that I use every day. </p>
<p> In 2012, we started a series called "What We Use," where we, the AP staff, talked about the stuff that we can't live without. It started off as something where we just discussed our Android devices and computers, but last year we took that a step further (at Artem's request, no less) and discussed a lot more than that, basically covering everything that we love in our lives. The most important stuff to us, as people. </p>
<p> It's been over a year since my last WWU post, and you probably know what that means: time for a new one. I actually really enjoy writing these posts, and I hope you enjoy reading it. </p>
<p> Howdy. The name's Michael Crider, and I hope you've noticed that I've been hanging around here for the last year or so. I'm a web writer and general geek, born in Texas and now living in Colorado Springs. How I came to work for Android Police over the last 12 months (or possibly a bit longer) is a long and boring story. </p>
<p> Here are the bullet points you need to get context on the following exploration of my stuff: my dad was a computer engineer who worked for General Dynamics and Lockheed back in the 80s, and so I've been surrounded by varying bits of technology for essentially my entire life. </p>

<p> It's my turn to share what items I use to get stuff done each day, but first, I realize that I have yet to formally introduce myself to you guys. Hello, dear readers. My name is Bertel King, Jr., I'm 24 years old, and I consider myself incredibly fortunate. Back in 2012, I graduated from the second oldest college in the US and married the woman whom I dated for all four of my years there. </p>
<p> I can't believe it's already been a year since the last What We Use, but alas, it has. Basically everything has changed in my device collection since last year, so there's a lot to talk about this go around. Before we get into the stuff you're actually here to see, however, l want to point out that we're going to take a slightly different approach to the What We Use series this time. </p>

<p> It's been four years since I shared with you all the gadgets and quirky things that I own and love in my previous What We Use post. In the time since, a lot has changed in my personal life. I met the most awesome, weird, and pun-loving man. We got married, moved into an apartment of our own, and started traveling a little more frequently. </p>
<p> But a lot is still the same. I still pull double work duties: I own and manage my pharmacy, and I work here at Android Police, obviously. In between selling drugs and counseling patients, I sit back at my desk, clean up hundreds of emails a day, write a few posts, virtually shout at the entire team if they miss an Oxford comma, and come up with silly or inappropriate jokes. </p>

<p> wheel </p>
<p> First, A Brief Introduction... </p>
<p> If you've been paying even the slightest bit of attention to the tech world for the past year or two, you're probably well aware that Android has more or less taken over the smartphone scene. Way back in June of 2010, Google revealed that 160,000 Android devices were being activated per day - at the time, that was more than double the combined total of iPhone, Mac, and iPad activations. </p>
<p> One of the reasons I love Android is because you can customize the heck out of your experience. Replacing the stock launcher with Launcher Pro is pretty much the first thing I do now when I get a new phone because of the innovations a hard-working, smart, and dedicated engineer (Fede) can bring to the table. </p>
<p> However, Launcher Pro is not too much different from the stock UI, outside of tweaks and other little but important things - same goes for ADW and other home replacements. </p>

<p> wheel of fortune </p>
<p> You're probably well aware of HQ Trivia, the quiz app that doles out cash prizes to winners of its scheduled trivia sessions. The app has been wildly popular, and creator Intermedia Labs wants to keep its hot streak going with another game show-inspired app: HQ Words. </p>
<p> The Play Store is filled with great games to cram onto your mobile device, but there's another Android marketplace you may have forgotten to check. Don't worry, I have your back. Amazon is currently offering eight free games as part of today's Game Pack. If you throw in the usual free app of the day, that actually makes nine games you can get just by hitting up Amazon before the day is up. </p>
<p> This pack contains some real time killers. Gravity Guy is a compelling experience that has been around for a while, and Buddy & Me is just absolutely adorable. </p>

<p> where’s my water </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a quirky Tin Man game book, a gorgeous endless Neverending runner, and a fusion of Minecraft and Where's My Water. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got the latest pixelated title from Noodlecake, a game that rides Olympic coattails, a game for insane pony enthusiasts, and a (possible) driving sequel. </p>
<p> Where's My Water? was a surprise hit when it came out on mobile devices a few years ago, and now there is a sequel with a lot of the same great gameplay mechanics and a ton more content. Where's My Water 2 was released on iOS a few weeks ago, but it has finally washed up in Google Play. It's still a fun physics puzzler, but Disney is going with a free-to-play model and in-app purchases. </p>
<p> Will someone please tell Disney to stop passing the Where's My Water property around the corporate offices? After the physics puzzle game and its cutesy alligator mascot gained a nice little fanbase on Android, Where's My Perry was released last year, with a somewhat odd tie-in to the Phineas And Ferb cartoon. Now Disney has reached all the way back to Mister Mouse himself, and Where's My Mickey is available on the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Earlier this morning, something strange happened. A handful of paid Disney games – including Where's My Water?, Temple Run: Brave, and Wreck-it Ralph, among others – suddenly showed up as free in the Play Store. Naturally, stories started popping up in the Android world that a bunch of fairly popular games were suddenly available without charge for no apparent reason. Perhaps Disney decided that it was time to give some titles away – but that didn't make much sense, as the "lite" versions of most titles were still present alongside their formerly-paid counterparts. </p>
<p> In the latest installment of Disney's holiday-themed spinoff of 'Where's My Water?' our platypus and alligator heroes - Swampy and Perry - embark on a journey through 12 love-themed levels of physics puzzler action. These are twelve all-new challenges, and as you might guess, the amount of pink reaches pandemic proportions. </p>
<p> You can get 'Where's My Valentine?' on the Play Store now, via the link below. </p>
<p> Leave it to Disney to go all out like this. In a very rapid release of new apps, everyone's favorite kid-friendly distributor of films, TV shows, games and anything else that can empty parents' wallets has dropped on us three new titles. For starters, Nemo's Reef. This let's-call-it-a-game expands on the Finding Nemo franchise (naturally), and allows players to create their own underwater reef. You can customize the fish's home, add various characters from the movies including Gill, Dory, Bloat and Bubbles, and even plant a variety of seeds. </p>
<p> You made your nominations, and we've selected four of the most popular titles named as "Best New Android Game of 2011" for you to vote on. You voted. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner. </p>
<p> Best New Android Game Of 2011: Reader's Choice </p>
<p> And the Andy goes to.... Shadowgun - by a razor thin 14 votes. </p>
<p> While it was by the narrowest of margins that Shadowgun won a plurality of the votes (32% - see below), it's not hard to see why - truly amazing graphics, great over the shoulder gameplay, and console-level polish made it clear from the day we first saw screenshots of this game that it was going to do big things. </p>

<p> which should you buy </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Note20 Ultra packs in plenty of high-end specs like a Snapdragon 865+, big 120Hz display, one of the biggest camera sensors you can get, plus a periscope-style telephoto camera, laser autofocus, and the well-known S Pen. But before you go dropping $1,300 on a pre-order, you might want to consider what you're looking for in a phone, and the OnePlus 8 Pro might also be on your radar. </p>
<p> Samsung's Note20 Ultra is here, and as its name suggests, it shares quite a lot in common with the recent Galaxy S20 Ultra, and that includes a sky-high price tag. So, what did Samsung learn from the Galaxy S20 Ultra, and which should you get? </p>
<p> As with last year's Note10 and Note10+, Samsung has again released two Note-series phones, begging the usual question: Which should you buy? Of course, that always comes down to your wants and budget, but it should still be a surprisingly easy decision to make, given how different the two phones are. </p>

<p> whisper </p>
<p> Several months ago, we discussed something called Nearby, a project that - at the time - seemed to be Google's effort to let "people, places, and things" know when a user is, well, nearby. It seems that Google is still hard at work on its effort to connect various devices to each other and their surroundings, but Copresence (an internal name for this functionality) may have a more specific scope in this effort than we first estimated, apparently including iOS devices in the fun. </p>
<p> A couple of months ago, we posted one of our early Google Search/Now rumors, and it was something of a long range rumor compared to others. While things like parking reminders, proper timer management, and bill pay reminders have already seen their public release, the ability to set contact-based reminders ("remind me when I'm with this person"), hasn't come forward yet. But it will likely appear very soon with a new feature in Android called Nearby, which will allow new interactions between you and nearby people, places, and things. </p>

<p> whispering willows </p>
<p> Here we are with another week underway and another duo of an app and a game being discounted on the Play Store. This week's titles are Aqualert Premium and Whispering Willows. </p>
<p> The most interesting of the two is the game, Whispering Willows. It's a hand-drawn 2D adventure game originally funded on Kickstarter. You play as Elena who's on a journey in the Willows Mansion to find her missing father and who does so by solving puzzles using her astral projection. </p>
<p> As for Aqualert, it is a water drinking tracker and reminder app that makes it easy to enter how much water you drank and see how many more cups you need to reach your daily goal. </p>
<p> Whispering Willows is the kind of game we'd like to see more of on any platform. The art style alone shows how much care and attention the designers approached the game with. That it happens to be fun is almost a perk. </p>
<p> The hand-drawn experience centers on Elena, a girl who can project her spirit outside of her body. Controlling her astral projection to solve puzzles forms the crux of the gameplay. </p>
<p> Last week, we took a look at the nominees for Ouya's 10-day developer competition, Create. Today, we have the winners! These game devs will receive some undisclosed amount of money (out of a pot of $45,000) and almost certainly end up on the launch version of the Ouya console. So, what are they? Well, let's break them down by category. </p>
<p> "Pop Your Eyes Out" Award: Pipnis </p>
<p> We covered this one in our roundup last week, though we're at a loss to explain how it didn't win the "Best Couch with Friends" Award. This is the game that requires two players to share a single controller. </p>

<p> whisperpush </p>
<p> After being part of CyanogenMod for two years, the end of the road has come for WhisperPush. The project announced today that it would end support for its own implementation of the secure messaging protocol developed by Open Whisper Systems. </p>
<p> The CyanogenMod team has been working on a secure messaging component for the popular ROM in recent months, and the time has come for some real world testing. The new encrypted WhisperPush messaging system is being rolled out to CyanogenMod 10.2 nightlies for compatibility and server load testing. If all goes as planned, it will reach the CM11 branch soon. </p>
<p> CyanogenMod's secure messaging is an implementation of TextSecure, a cross-platform encrypted SMS platform maintained by Open WhisperSystems. The CyanogenMod version of TextSecure is being handled by the lead engineer from Open WhisperSystem, Moxie Marlinspike. This isn't the same as just bundling an app with the ROM, though. </p>

<p> White balance </p>
<p> Google has been pouring a lot of effort into nailing down photo processing on its flagships since it started building its own phones. In the Pixel 4 and 4 XL, the company may have added too many intelligent camera features for their own good. It introduced a new machine-learning-based white balance algorithm that is supposed to produce more natural-looking images under harsh lighting conditions, but as it turns out, some edge cases can end up looking worse instead. </p>
<p> A build of Android Q beta 5 leaked yesterday with a new sensitivity setting for the back gesture, and hidden within it is a new version of Google Camera 6.3. The current stable build we all have is v6.2, so 6.3 is still an unreleased update and could change in the future before it reaches the public. But it does give us a glimpse into what Google is working on with its Camera app. </p>
<p> Duo has done well positioning itself as a simple, yet innovative app for video chat. Despite a focus on simplicity, it's time to begin experimenting with enhancements that can establish Duo with new audiences. The latest update contains clues suggesting the development team may bring some advanced camera settings to the app so users can make sure they're sending the very best image possible. </p>
<p> Google bought photo editor Snapseed a little less than four years ago, and the developers have been steadily improving the app and adding new features since then. The latest version is 2.9, which started rolling out to new users yesterday and just hit the publicly-accessible Play Store a few hours ago. There's nothing mind-blowing in the updated version, but a handful of new features will make long-time users happy (and might get rid of one of the other photo apps you rely on concurrently). </p>
<p> Recent updates to both the Photos and Camera apps have included some really interesting clues, suggesting Google may be planning to put a lot of effort into upping its game with smartphone photographers. The latest update to Snapseed was no different; not only did it bring a few worthwhile new features, but some resources inside the apk also betray plans for the future. Snapseed will be adding enhanced controls for working with white balance in RAW mode and there's an effects randomizer coming to the editor. </p>
<p> Teardown </p>
<p> Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. </p>
<p> The Nexus 6 was a pretty good device when it was released last year, but it was not without its flaws. One glaring issue the phone had was an AMOLED panel with sub-par white balance and color reproduction. Well, it seems the Nexus team heard your complaints and confirmed on Reddit that they have addressed the problem by outfitting this year's flagship, the Nexus 6P, with the latest gen Samsung AMOLED panel. </p>
<p> What's more, they also spent a considerable amount of time fine tuning the white balance and color gamut on the panel to give it the highest amount of accuracy possible. </p>

<p> white Desire </p>
<p> If you live in European markets, you may be glad to hear that HTC is offering a new color for two of their phones: the HTC Desire, which will soon come in "Brilliant White", and the HTC Legend, which will soon be available in "Phantom Black." </p>
<p> There's no doubt that each phone looks really slick, but you've got to wonder the purpose of a black Legend: wasn't its main appeal the gorgeous metal finish? </p>
<p> If you read our review of the HTC Desire, you'll already know that the physical design of the phone is hardly the first thing that needs to be changed. </p>
<p> Regardless, we can't complain about the changes HTC is rumored to be making here: </p>
<p> Yep, what we're looking at is a white version of the Desire, and even though I'm not exactly known to go crazy over white gadgets (especially when they're phones), I've got to admit this one's pretty hot. </p>

<p> The Galaxy S20 is an incredibly expensive phone, no matter which one you buy, with the range-topping S20 Ultra starting a jaw-dropping $1400. When you're carrying a phone that's more expensive than some people's first cars, it's understandable that you'll want to buy a good case to keep it crack-free. Glass sandwiches may be all the rage in phone design right now, but there's no denying they're fragile, and picking a case to protect your new investment can be tough, especially with so many names and brands out there to choose from. We've got reviews of some of the top cases from brands like Spigen, Speck, Poetic, dbrand, Supcase, Pitaka, Ringke, and Samsung itself. </p>

<p> With phones getting as expensive as they are, you'd have to be nuts not to get a case to protect your investment. A base model Pixel 2 is nearly $700 out the door, with the 128GB Pixel 2 XL going into four-figure territory. But even after you've made the decision to spend a few bucks on a case, you might be wondering which one in particular you should buy. </p>

<p> A few days ago, I covered the new wallpaper collections that Google published on the Chrome OS Canary channel. I bring this up because while I was writing that article, I noticed that some of the wallpapers in the Elements collection have light and dark variants. I'll admit — I was unsure if this suggested we were getting a dark theme soon, but I knew it was coming thanks to several code changes discovered by Chrome Story. I did not expect Google also to be working on a light theme. </p>
<p> Google has been working on a Gboard redesign for more than two months now, and it looks like the company is finally starting to roll it out to the first few beta testers currently using version 9.8.07 of the app. The new look trades the Roboto font for Product Sans and fits the latest revisions to Google's Material Theme much better. </p>

<p> white UI </p>
<p> Google sure loves its negative space. Following bright refreshes of both Gmail and Google Drive earlier this year, Google Help has been overhauled with a new layout that includes way, way more white than the previous design. </p>
<p> Back at I/O in May, Google revealed a bunch of features for Lens—some of which were already being tested in some form, but all of which were pretty slick. Based on a mixture of recent reports, our own experiences, and Google's recent tweets, the new features Google described should have arrived on most compatible phones as of yesterday. The snazzy new functionality in Lens includes real-time detection, Smart Text selection, and a new white UI. </p>
<p> Over the past few weeks, Google has been changing the interface of a few applications, making them brighter with more rounded edges. The mobile search site recently switched to this layout, and the in-progress Chrome redesign has it too. Assistant now fits in with this design language, as a visual change has started to roll out to users. </p>

<p> Google quickly cracked down on apps claiming to help diagnose or detect the COVID-19 coronavirus, except those verified to come from health agencies. Now the World Health Organization (WHO) has published an Android app for COVID-19, designed to offer basic safety guidance and provide up-to-date news. </p>
<p> Google Now is a powerful tool. A step toward Google's vision of a Star Trek computer in the palm of your hand, Now is built to serve up information that you need, exactly when you need it, without you asking for it. </p>
<p> To that end, the service has seen many improvements since its debut. It will tell you when your favorite teams are playing, when you need to leave to make it to the airport on time, whether your plane is delayed, and plenty of info about your destination and surrounding attractions, among numerous other things. </p>
<p> One of the more impressive features of Now is its ability to set really smart reminders. </p>

<p> Nougat. Listen, I can get over the name, Google. And I know, this is such a hot take. But the name isn't my big problem here. The name could be salvageable, even if I'm pretty sure the last time someone ate "nougat" unironically was in like 1783 or something. No, the problem is this statue. It's just bad. </p>
<p> What we have here is a bugdroid, slightly posed, standing on top of what admittedly are probably the most appetizing representations possible of the candied joylessness that is nougat. It's just standing there... over some nougat. Who stands on nougat? Why? What does this statue convey - that the bugdroid feels so unexcited about its dessert-y namesake that it just decided to trample on it on its way to the big unveil? </p>

<p> The coronavirus pandemic continues on and social distancing is the new normal. But you've probably seen news footage of hordes of people at the supermarket, ready to pounce on a pallet of toilet paper or a bottle of hand sanitizer come the rooster's crow. Doesn't look too socially distant, huh? Maybe you'd be better off having your groceries delivered for you. If you're able to pay a small premium, then there are a bunch of apps that can help, and we've got the skinny on them. </p>

Additionally, all Whole Foods Market 365 stores nationwide will carry the Prime discounts, so you should be able to find one somewhere not too far away. </p>

<p> whoops </p>
<p> There have already been several Developer Previews of Android 11, and Google planned to release the first beta-quality build during an online 'Beta Launch Show' on June 3rd. That event was cancelled last week, due to widespread protests in the United States, but that hasn't stopped Google from rolling out the first Android 11 Beta to some Pixel owners — perhaps unintentionally. </p>
<p> Ever accidentally removed an icon from your home screen? Well, neither have I, but should it ever happen to you, Android Q makes it easier to fix on Pixel devices. When an item is removed, a little pop-up will present the option to bring it back. </p>
<p> You've almost certainly said something you regretted in a chat, whether it was because you were tired, angry, or just looking at the wrong conversation — but Facebook Messenger could soon get a feature that'll let you take those misguided statements back. Evidence has been found that an "unsend" option is in the works. </p>
<p> Google is expected to announce a refreshed Chromecast at its hardware event in New York today, but it seems a UK retailer got its timing a little off. Very, online purveyor of clothes, furniture, and electronics, is already selling the new model. </p>
<p> About two years ago, Huawei tried passing a photo from a $4,500 camera off as one from the then-new P9. Samsung Brazil's just done the same thing, but with a lot less justification, by attempting to pass a stock photo off as a sample from the Galaxy A8's front-facing camera - twice. </p>
<p> Applying machine learning to everything under the sun can be tricky. Case in point: Gboard's text prediction has been suggesting people type "my face and" after the words "sit on," resulting in a reference to a sexual act. Google says it's an accident, though, and it's working on a fix for the errant suggestion. </p>
<p> Besides a bevy of new features, Android's update to 4.4 brought forth a ton of tweaks to the interface through GEL launcher and a fresh round of updated stock apps. There's little doubt Android's user experience and overall design paradigms are continuing to evolve, becoming more refined, usable, and useful. We covered most of the changes to the interface in Getting to Know Android but, as with any major update, new changes come with new opportunities for error. </p>
<p> There are plenty of incongruences, inconsistencies, and lingering design problems in Android 4.4, and just like previous entries in the Stock Android Isn't Perfect series, we'll be running through those of note. </p>
<p> So far, the red Galaxy S III has been limited strictly to AT&T. If you wanted to get your hands on that device in the color that denotes danger and sexiness (you know, in keeping with the whole calming 'nature' theme), then two-thirds of U.S. mobile users would have to switch carriers. Now, however, you can get a red Galaxy S III 920 from Wal-Mart as long as you don't mind it being a Lumia 920, running Windows Phone, and not being a Galaxy S III at all. </p>
<p> Wait, that's not right. </p>
<p> Someone at Wal-Mart is either very confused, very stupid, or brilliant and out to make Artem's day. </p>

<p> wh-xb900n </p>
<p> While we couldn't offer a full-throated endorsement of the Sony WH-XB900N noise-canceling headphones in our review, a massive price cut off the list price of $248 may make them worthy of your consideration. Right now, you can grab a pair of these bass-packed wireless headphones from Amazon for only $123 ($125 off list price). </p>
<p> We didn't recommend the Sony WH-XB900N when reviewing the headphones, but now a tempting $128 price tag is making us give the pair a second look. At $120 off, this is the cheapest price we've seen for the headphones. </p>
<p> Most ANC headphones on the market, Sony's own WH-1000XM3 included, are fairly neutral-sounding. But given how popular Beats headphones are, it was only a matter of time before a bass-focused ANC offering popped up in the market. The WH-XB900N Extra Bass caters to that specific audience, and at $250, it undercuts the 1000XM3's MSRP by $100. </p>
<p> However, the XB900N feels like it's lost a lot more than that $100 in value when compared to the 1000XM3. It's worse in every measurable metric, and not just by a little. Consider the recent discounts that have brought the 1000XM3 to sub-$250 prices, and you can quickly see that it doesn't make much sense to recommend the XB900N at all. </p>

<p> why </p>
<p> Facial recognition on Android isn't the most robust method of securing your phone; it even says as much when you set it up. It shouldn't be very surprising, then, that it can be fooled by what is probably the least likely thing someone trying to get into your device will have access to: a lifelike, 3D-printed replica of your head. </p>
<p> For some reason, it seems like every single social media service wants to add stories to their platform. Snapchat really kicked the concept off, Instagram decided to copy it, and then Zuckerberg and friends decided to put it in Facebook too. Now, YouTube is joining in on the fun as well. </p>
<p> Bose is known for making high-end audio gear. It shouldn't be surprising, then, that its latest fully wireless earbuds cost $250. What is a little surprising, though, is that the new "revolutionary noise-masking sleepbuds" (sleepbuds is one word, lowercase) can't play music. These pricey, battery-powered, Bluetooth-connected earphones are made solely to drown out noise and help you sleep, and they literally can't do anything else. </p>
<p> When discussing smartwatches, most of us agree that Samsung's Gear S3 is one of the best. It's my personal favorite and I think that Sammy did a great job with it. However, as seems to be the trend these days, the Korean company has paired up with TUMI, a "travel lifestyle brand," to bring us a special version of the Gear S3 Frontier. Thanks! </p>
<p> How do you tell a Periscope streamer you like what they've got? Hearts. How do you tell them you really like what they've got? Super Hearts. The latter is a new item in the Periscope app, and it'll cost you. Twitter has added in-app purchases for Super hearts to its live streaming app to squeeze some revenue out of the previously free service. </p>
<p> Today Samsung announced that it has released the Galaxy J3 Pro in India. The phone is a low-to-midrange device with no exciting specifications to speak of, save one. It is launching with Android 5.1 Lollipop. This is noteworthy almost to the point of humor, as Lollipop is now two major updates behind and a year old. </p>
<p> Instagram is getting some new features to appeal to your creative side. If you've been dying for some face filters for your posts or Direct messages, you can now have them. More features are also being added, like video rewind and hashtags right on the Stories that you post. Sounds... engaging. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 plus are two of the most attractive smartphones that have come out in the past few years. With their super-slim bezels, rounded corners, and glass backs that come in a variety of colors, the S8 and S8+'s good looks can't be denied. Most of the accessories that debuted alongside the duo, such as the Alcantara Cover and Clear View Standing Cover, aren't bad-looking either. However, there's one exception to the rule - the 2Piece Cover. If you want to make your gorgeous new phone look like absolute crap, you should seriously consider one of these. </p>
<p> One of the newest storms to hit the Internet was the change to Evernote's privacy policy. While this is usually reserved for those of us who can wade through varying levels of legalese (I admit that I'm weird), I do recommend that all users of the note-taking service take a quick pass through one section in particular. And even though people all over are up in arms, there are a few key points to consider. </p>
<p> In this job I work with a lot of public relations people. Their task is similar to mine, but in the opposite direction: while the responsibility of tech journalists is to present consumers with information that helps them make buying decisions, PR agents are generally instructed to drive sales by getting the news out. There's nothing wrong with the profession itself, and I've known great PR agents and those who are not so great. But I often look across the professional aisle and feel profound sympathy for my counterparts on the corporate side of tech media. </p>

<p> why does it cost so much </p>
<p> In this job I work with a lot of public relations people. Their task is similar to mine, but in the opposite direction: while the responsibility of tech journalists is to present consumers with information that helps them make buying decisions, PR agents are generally instructed to drive sales by getting the news out. There's nothing wrong with the profession itself, and I've known great PR agents and those who are not so great. But I often look across the professional aisle and feel profound sympathy for my counterparts on the corporate side of tech media. </p>
<p> When it comes to insane, flashy, over-the-top launchers, two immediately come to mind: GO Launcher's Next and TSF Shell. They're both about as "cutting edge" as it gets, and have a price tag to match – Next is roughly $16, while TSF is closer to $17. Still, if you're a fan of the latter (or have been on the fence about picking it up), it just got a pretty sizable update that brings a new dock, "desktop menu buttons," and some other "amazing" new features: </p>
<p> What's in this version: </p>
<p> Version 1.9.9 Ari 4th 1.Innovative Smart Dock (free size/position/direction/capacity). 2.Desktop menu buttons integrate in Smart Dock, easy operation and save desktop space. </p>

<p> why does this exist </p>
<p> Robots on Kickstarter or Indiegogo usually are slow-moving and expensive products, with little or no real utility. I don't think 'Aire' is anything different, but it's certainly... special. For $699 (or $749, once the base tier runs out), you can have the privilege of owning a hovering upside-down lampshade with the Alexa voice assistant built-in. </p>
<p> Games made specifically for Android Wear devices were almost inevitable. Despite the small size, there's a lot of potential for Wear integration for full-sized Android games - you could use your watch as a Star Trek-style alert system for an RPG, or as a fun secondary screen, like the Visual Memory Unit on the old Dreamcast. Even games limited to Wear itself could do a lot with simple taps or swipes. So the fact that the first Android Wear game we've come across is a Flappy Bird clone, is, you might say, a bit disappointing. </p>
<p> Meet Flopsy Droid. It's a Flappy Bird clone in every sense of the term: one-touch gameplay, constant forward motion, weird arc physics. </p>
<p> I would like to personally thank the developers of Dickorate for making an app that is slightly less-obviously ripe for the banning on the Play Store. However, avoiding cartoon imagery of naughty bits still might not be enough to save this app from the banhammer. The Dickorate app allows you to take pictures of any elongated cylindrical object you have handy and add mustaches, hats, sunglasses, and more. To save you the trouble, I have personally tested this app and included the image I took below. </p>

<p> Why Google Why? </p>
<p> We've got some breaking news for you: Google has renamed its Keep app to 'Keep Notes.' We know, it's mind-boggling stuff. Nothing in the app seems to have changed otherwise, though, so it looks like someone at Google just got bored and decided to add another word to this app name. </p>
<p> You open a maps application, you expect to see a map of where you are. It's common sense, yet we have to start this news article with this pretty basic knowledge bit. The reason? Whoever is behind the latest Google Maps server-side test seems to have missed that "Map app making 101" lesson and went free-styling with their own ideas. </p>
<p> Oh Google! Oh Google! Oh Google! No sooner is the company putting to rest one social-slash-messaging app than it is working on three others in its wake. Today's newcomer is a photo sharing and editing app that Google confirmed to TechCrunch as "one of many [experiments] it's running." </p>
<p> According to TechCrunch, this new app would be like a mix of Path and Snapchat and Google Photos, leveraging Google's image recognition technology. It is less of a messaging app and more of a place where users create and join groups dedicated to photo sharing. Anyone could upload, edit, and tag the photos shared to a group, and Google would work its magic sauce behind the scenes to identify objects in photos, tag them, organize them, and make them easier to find in the future. </p>

<p> LineageOS is the most popular custom ROM around, and version 17.1 is based on the newest Android 10 release. The Lineage project has been slowly updating older devices to 17.1, and in the time since our previous coverage, even more devices have arrived in the official roster. </p>
<p> The LineageOS custom ROM used to support just about every phone imaginable, but lately the project has been going for quality over quantity. Oreo (15.1) builds have to fulfill stricter requirements to receive official status, and now Lineage is dropping support for 30 unmaintained phones and tablets. </p>
<p> TWRP is the tool of choice for everything from flashing custom ROMs to backing up your phone. Last time we covered the project, it added support for the Moto X4. Since then, a few more devices have been added, including the Sony Xperia XA2 and Verizon Wear24 smartwatch. </p>

<p> If you head over to Amazon's Facebook page right now and press "Like," you'll find the first product in Amazon's ongoing A-Z Sweepstakes, a Motorola XOOM, is up for grabs. Eight of them - to be precise. All you have to do is give Amazon your name, email address, and phone number to enter. This is a US residents-only contest, though (unlike our super-awesome Motorola XOOM Wi-Fi Giveaway.) </p>
<p> Great news for those of you holding out for that WiFi-only XOOM of your dreams: Costco has moved up its availability date for the LTE-less version of the tablet from April 1 to this coming Sunday, March 27. So if you walk into your local Costco this weekend, presumably the WiFi XOOM will be there to greet you for the reasonable price of $599.99. </p>
<p> But, if you order online, you'll get a couple of perks (even if it does mean you won't be getting your XOOM on Sunday). </p>

<p> The folks over at Android Authority today have an exclusive that confirms the specifications and appearance of the Moto X4. Just yesterday photos of a real device leaked, but now the precise details of Motorola's upcoming phone are known quantities. And those numbers and names look pretty good on paper, especially when it comes to the cameras. </p>
<p> Smartphone cameras have quickly taken over as the primary point-and-shoot for many people, and while they offer up a quick way to take a shot, their use is still fairly limited. If you're looking to get more out of your smartphone's camera, then these add-on lenses may be just what the doctor ordered. </p>
<p> What Are They? </p>
<p> They're small lenses that bring three commonly used mods to your smartphone camera: wide angle/macro, fisheye, and telephoto. They're very simple to use, but I'll warn you upfront - they do require a bit of modification to your phone in order to work. What sort of mod, you ask? </p>

<p> Google appears to be tired of the endless cycle of leaks and speculation when it comes to the Pixel 4. The company today has published a blog post and video showing off the upcoming phone's facial recognition tech, as well as gesture controls. We also get a tearaway view of the top of the Pixel 4 (pictured above) showing what that gap in previous leaks was for — a lot of things, it turns out. </p>
<p> Google's Pixel 3 and 3 XL didn't pack a whole lot of hardware surprises, considering the unceasing deluge of leaks over recent months, but the software was another story. There were plenty of new camera features shown off at the Made by Google 2018 event, with oodles of machine learning magic to go around. Unfortunately for owners of older Pixel phones, not all of these new features will be coming to older handsets. For your convenience, we put together a list of all the major software changes that will (and won't) be coming to previous models. </p>

<p> wide-angle video </p>
<p> A much-requested feature is hiding inside the Android 10 update for the OnePlus 7 Pro. Starting with Developer Preview 5, the 7 Pro picked up the ability to capture video with all three cameras, including the wide-angle and telephoto. In fact, several of the camera modes now work with more of the device's cameras. </p>
<p> These days, OnePlus is known for engaging with its customers more than most smartphone manufacturers do, feeling out their interests when it comes to certain features. Just earlier today, the company published a series of responses related to customer feedback for the 7 Pro, covering a range of topics from the "ghost touch" issue to ongoing camera improvements, and even the potential its latest phone might pick up always-on display functionality — one of the most common requests. </p>

<p> wide color gamut </p>
<p> This is a guest post from developer Carlos Lopez, also known as ShortFuse. He’s the developer of SuperOneClick and Fusion. </p>
<p> As detailed in my recent color explainer, the Pixel 2 and 2 XL have a default method of displaying colors in a limited color space. Google’s software doesn’t include an option to force a wide gamut, so I created an app that does it. You can download the new Oreo Colorizer right now, and you don’t even need to root your phone. </p>
<p> Color profiles aren't exactly a sexy topic, but in the worlds of professional photography and video, knowing what colors your display can accurately reproduce is hugely important, and equally important is knowing exactly which color profiles it's capable of representing. To date, supporting color profiles in Android has largely been incumbent upon device manufacturers and chip vendors, meaning there was no one solution for figuring out which profiles a device could display. With Android O, Google will offer a native way for developers to specify a way to display their apps in wide color gamut modes if a device marks them as supported. </p>

<p> Netflix users are probably familiar with the "Smart Downloads" feature that allows your device to automatically pull down the latest episodes of shows you watch, just in case you end up with a hankering for some TNG or Great British Baking Show later when data is harder to come by. Supplementing this existing feature, we've spotted a new "Downloads For You" feature that expands that functionality to shows and movies you haven't watched yet. Paired with that, the Playback Specification diagnostics screen and in-app brightness controls are also rolling out more widely. </p>
<p> Disney, lord and master of almost all entertainment media, will soon grace us with yet another subscription service. It's not taking any chances with you filthy pirates, though. Disney+ will reportedly require the most stringent type of Widevine DRM. So, it might not even work on your device. </p>
<p> It's a bit of a bummer that the OnePlus 7 is only able to stream Netflix at "HD" resolution — that's below the full 1440p resolution of its beautiful display, after all. But if you decide to unlock the bootloader for future root/ROM adventures, then you'll have to make do with just non-HD 480p Netflix streams. </p>
<p> Today's theme seems to be DRM. Security researcher David Buchanan has managed to crack open Widevine L3, one of Google's less secure Widevine DRM implementations used by apps like Netflix and Hulu. Once decrypted, streams using the DRM method can be played back in "plain old ffmpeg" — trivially easily, in other words. </p>
<p> Xiaomi's Pocophone F1 has already made waves in the smartphone industry for being incredibly affordable; a ~$300 phone with a Snapdragon 845 processor is virtually unheard of. Budget phones are inherently going to have some tradeoffs, and a less-obvious one has been discovered: lack of support for Widevine L1 DRM. </p>
<p> OnePlus' phones are a great value, but they've each individually had a few drawbacks. One negative they all had in common, though, was a DRM deficiency. None of the company's handsets supported the correct Widevine level required for HD playback in Netflix. Distress on the subject came to a head late last year, and OnePlus surprisingly announced that it would add the feature in the future. In a comment on OnePlus' forums today the company confirmed that it was now able to update handsets to support it, but the process will require that you physically send the phone back to OnePlus for the update. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 5T is one of our favorite phones at AP. It's a fantastic value, improving on its predecessor without costing a whole lot more. But there is still one unfortunate disadvantage to using one. Like OnePlus' older phones, it doesn't support the correct DRM level for HD playback on services such as Netflix. But OnePlus has promised us that this will be corrected in the future for the OnePlus 5 and 5T. </p>
<p> This May, Netflix started blocking rooted and unlocked devices from downloading the company's app on Google Play. It was an unfortunate restriction that locked out many people and stirred up a lot of anger. Over the last week, some of us at AP have started noticing the app reappearing, even though our devices still don't pass SafetyNet/Google Play device certification. </p>
<p> Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. </p>

<p> Ever wanted to make your 2020 lockscreen look like it stepped out of 2012? The good ol' days when you could view your upcoming calendar appointments, stock prices, and the weather without unlocking your phone? You're in luck, because a new app from developer Zachary Wander promises to put all the widgets you want on your lock screen where they belong. </p>
<p> Widgets were once triumphed as one of Android's small victories over other platforms, offering extra utility that almost everyone saw as a clear benefit — or, at least, a fun avenue for customization. They've been around now for over a decade, and though third party support has waxed and waned, we're curious to know: Do you use a widget on your home screen/launcher? If so, how many have you got? </p>
<p> Pixel phones, or more specific, the Pixel Launcher, comes with a neat widget that gives you an overview of the weather, the current date, upcoming appointments, and commute estimates. Google even includes a basic version of this widget for everyone else, but it's not as capable as the Pixel Launcher solution — colors don't adjust to the background, and you can't change the size of the text. Another Widget changes that and adds a ton of features on top, and after 2.5 years without updates, the developer has finally pushed version 2 to the Play Store. It includes dearly needed bug fixes and new capabilities. </p>
<p> Google seems to have recently been reminded of the existence of homescreen widgets on Android. After adding a widget for Tasks, another relatively new Google app is getting the same treatment: YouTube Music. </p>
<p> Google Tasks has taken several steps forward since its launch in April of last year. Many of the features that were then missing, like recurring tasks and timed reminders, app shortcuts, proper Gmail integration, sharing to the app, and more, have been implemented. The service now has the barebones necessities of a to-do manager and is continuing to improve. With the latest update, it has added two homescreen widgets and a dark theme. </p>
<p> What's that new gap on your home screen? No, your phone didn't get bigger—Spotify has decided to remove the playback widget from its Android app. The company has posted a message on its community forums about the change, and the response has been predictably negative. </p>
<p> Earlier this week, Spotify unceremoniously killed its Android widget, taking away home screen-based controls for the streaming service. Odds are that most of you didn't notice — or if you did, you probably didn't care too much since you can still use the ongoing notification's controls during playback — but for those that were upset at the loss, there's a workaround. Using Tasker and KWGT, you can re-create a convincing approximation of Spotify's lost widget. </p>
<p> One of the nicer features of the Pixel Launcher is the smart At A Glance widget that shows the date and weather most times, then surfaces important and timely information when you need it. Currently, it's the place for calendar events, upcoming flights, and traffic conditions, but it's working on adding two more types of info. </p>
<p> Widgets, once one of the most appealing features of Android and now all but abandoned. A few years ago, an update to a widget, especially one from a Google app, would be noticed immediately and we would get dozens of tips about it in the span of a few hours. Nowadays hardly anyone uses widgets to even notice or care. So you may forgive us for not seeing this major change in the Gmail widget, which occurred toward the end of last month. </p>
<p> Over the weekend, an update to the Google app beta accidentally broke weather for the At A Glance Widget, affecting Pixel owners, some third-party launcher users, and anyone who manually added the widget since that became an option. Thankfully, an update (v9.0.4) which is rolling out today fixes the problem. </p>

<p> widgetlocker </p>
<p> More and more developers are taking advantage of the nifty new ability to start a semi-closed beta on the Google Play Store via Google+. The latest is TeslaCoil Software, makers of the customization tool WidgetLocker (among other things). If you want to try out the latest and possibly greatest version of WidgetLocker, just head for this Google+ Community and join in. </p>
<p> Joining the beta is quite simple. Once you join the community, click the Play Store link that's displayed on the page, go through the standard warnings and whatnot, and you'll be directed to a seemingly normal Play Store entry for the app. </p>
<p> If Android's stock lockscreen has become mundane and boring to you, then WidgetLocker – which comes from TeslaCoil Software, the creator of Nova Launcher – is one of the best replacement options on the Play Store. It recently received a somewhat significant update that brings a handful of new and useful features, like the ability to swipe left or right to access apps or the camera, respectively. That's not all TeslaCoil packed into this update, however: </p>
<p> Yesterday, we highlighted the hidden "labs" feature in Nova Launcher. Turns out that's not the only of TeslaCoil's apps with a secret menu - popular lockscreen replacement app WidgetLocker has a similar feature, except it's called "experimental." For all intents and purposes, though, it's the same thing. </p>
<p> It's also activated the same way: simply head into WL's settings menu and hold volume down for 1-2 seconds. Just like with Nova, you'll see a toast notification to let you know that the new menu was successfully unlocked. </p>
<p> WidgetLocker is no stranger to the spotlight -- it's easily the most popular lockscreen replacement app on the Market. With good reason, too: it's highly customizable and allows you actually make good use of the otherwise useless lockscreen. </p>
<p> TeslaCoil Software, the creative minds behind WidgetLocker, pushed the newest version of the app to the Market just a bit ago, and with it came some really nice features to an already incredible app, like the ICS, Honeycomb, and Sense 3 Unlock sliders -- and they all work perfectly. </p>
<p> The long planned, much anticipated update to WidgetLocker that adds themes has been released, and it's every bit as awesome as we expected. Perhaps the best part about it is that there's already a broad selection of themes available in the XDA thread, and it's likely that number will increase substantially as time goes on thanks to the groundwork laid by previous WL mods. </p>
<p> Once you find a theme you like, installation is very, very easy: </p>
<p> 1) When clicking on a link in the form of http://…foo.wltheme.zip, </p>
<p> Many people who use custom themes or launchers are familiar with WidgetLocker. What many people don't realize, though, is that customizing WidgetLocker itself is a fairly straightforward task. Better still, there are plenty of existing customizations available, meaning that you have to do little more than shove your modified .PNG files into the APK. </p>
<p> Before / After </p>
<p> Dalton Gore - better known as @colormeandroid - is responsible for gathering the individual mods and creating the guide. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/17 10:05am PDTon May 17, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/04 8:02am PDTon Jul 4, 2020. </p>
<p> With iOS 14, Apple certainly felt very "inspired" by a choice selection of Android features. One of the biggest was undoubtedly homescreen widgets, a fundamental part of the Android experience from day one. While widgets may not be as popular on the platform these days, it sure seems they'll be poised for a comeback given Apple's newest mobile OS. With that in mind, here are 11 of our favorite widgets for the platform (that actually look and work well). </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/06/22 3:05pm PDTon Jun 22, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/27 10:41am PDTon Jun 27, 2020. </p>
<p> Unless you've been forcibly avoiding the news, you know iOS 14 is now a thing. But if you don't use an iPhone (or maybe even if you do), you might not have bothered checking out what was new in Apple's latest mobile operating system. But as fail to be basically every year we watch the WWDC keynote, no one on the Android Police was surprised to have one recurring thought: "hey, that feature looks familiar." Apple apparently felt very inspired by Android in the last year, and iOS 14 has a whole bunch of "world-first" innovations to show you that—very coincidentally!—also </p>
<p> Ever wanted to make your 2020 lockscreen look like it stepped out of 2012? The good ol' days when you could view your upcoming calendar appointments, stock prices, and the weather without unlocking your phone? You're in luck, because a new app from developer Zachary Wander promises to put all the widgets you want on your lock screen where they belong. </p>
<p> Choosing and setting up widgets is one of the joys of using Android over iOS, so you shouldn't neglect them — and you've got a broader range of top-quality widgets to choose from than you might have realized. We've picked out some of our favorites, and they all bring something genuinely useful and functional to your home screen. </p>
<p> Google is no stranger to making unannounced changes to apps and services, and sometimes the changes don't even show up for all users or devices. At least some Android users have noticed an alteration to the Google Search widget today. The microphone icon is gone, replaced with Discover and Lens. </p>
<p> A black pall is being cast on many an app these days. But for many users, dark theming brings power savings on OLED displays and an eye-friendly nighttime aesthetic. So, for Google Fi subscribers who interface with its corresponding app, the latest update might give them a bit of a dark theme to look forward to — specifically found in the widget. </p>
<p> Every week, I examine somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred app updates while looking for changes. The most interesting things turn into APK Teardowns or Download posts. Many of the remaining updates are unremarkable, amounting to a few bug fixes, routine updates to libraries, or even just pixel-level adjustments to layouts and images. However, there are usually a few updates that land somewhere in between. I don't want to spam readers with dozens of short posts, but I hate to ignore things that people might want to know about, so I'm going to wrap up the leftovers for a little weekend reading and call it Update Notes. </p>
<p> It may be the silliest idea to some, but it may be the most interesting idea to others. Wearable Widgets, an app that transforms your phone's widgets into Wear OS (né Android Wear) watch faces, has added support for complications. So instead of replacing your entire watch face with a widget, you can leave whichever design you like and choose a widget from your phone as a complication inside it. How well does it work? I tested it to find out. </p>
<p> Apps are not forever, and it seemed like the end of the road for Zooper Widget last week when it vanished from the Play Store. However, in something of a Christmas miracle, the apps have returned. Well, I guess a miracle would have been an update to Zooper, but this appears to be the same outdated version we had before. Hey, at least it's back. </p>
<p> Today Google started rolling out another update to Google Voice, bringing things up to 5.2. The new version of the app brings widgets in three new sizes. It also provides a new setting in the app for the 7-year-old call screening feature. The feature has been around for a while, but you can now enable and disable it via the app. It seems the last few months were no fluke, and Google is committed to keeping Voice updated now that it's been redesigned out of the Holo era. </p>

<p> Arlo's cameras are among the better options when it comes to home security. While the company's products are expensive, they offer a great feature set, even if you'll probably have to pay for Arlo's Smart subscription to unlock the full potential. Past models have always needed an additional hub to connect to Wi-Fi, but recent additions to the lineup have forgone that requirement for direct Wi-Fi connectivity. The same is true for the Arlo Pro 4 Spotlight the company has just announced, making the Pro Spotlight series finally independent from hubs. Like its predecessor, the Pro 4 starts at $200. </p>
<p> Google is working on a Phone Hub similar to Microsoft Your Phone that will make your handset interact better with your Chromebook, but the company isn't ready to bring the feature to stable just yet. In the latest release of Chrome OS, version 85, the company instead focuses on many little things that make for an overall better experience: Wi-Fi password sync, improved settings search, and a volume slider for your microphone. </p>
<p> In the last few months, we've seen an increase of reports regarding a "w5 error" for Nest thermostats, causing them to be unable to connect to Wi-Fi. Some device owners have accused an update of being the cause of their woes, but whatever might be triggering the problem, Google tells us its a known issue affecting a very small number of users, and the company is issuing replacement devices if and when other troubleshooting methods fail. </p>
<p> Public Wi-Fi hotspots with captive portals — those websites where you have to accept terms and conditions or log in before you can access the internet — are the bane of existence for people who frequent cafés. Sometimes Android's captive portal check fails, and you have to figure out which website to visit to accept the terms. Other times, you'll notice it's hard to revisit the captive portal when you want to check how much data allowance you have left. Google is trying to make that whole process a lot smoother with Android 11, but it has to rely on public Wi-Fi providers' help for that. </p>

<p> Sharing Wi-Fi passwords is one of those awkward parts of modern life that just never seems to have an easy fix. Even with guest networks, you still have to share some kind of information with visitors to your home, and that often means spelling out some nonsense numbers and letter that they'll probably get wrong twice before you just write it down or text it to them. Thankfully, with Android 10, there's a much easier, faster, and simpler way to share your Wi-Fi password, no awkward conversation required. </p>
<p> There are plenty of cases where you might want a Wi-Fi network saved on your phone, but don't want your phone to always connect to it. Maybe your cell service is sometimes faster than your home internet, or maybe you have a public network that you don't want to use all the time. Whatever the reason might be, Android 11 will let you disable automatically connecting to specific networks. </p>
<p> While Stadia's launch last year arguably packed fewer features than we initially anticipated, Google is hard at work to add long-promised capabilities. This Tuesday, the company announced that it would roll out wireless Stadia controller support for laptops and desktops, and it looks like the capability is now already widely available. Just like always could on Chromecast, you can finally enjoy Stadia wirelessly on your computer using its first-party hardware. </p>

<p> Google Maps is an amazing and often indispensable service, and a big part of that is just how good it is at figuring out where you are. And the reason it's so good at is, like so many things Google does, lots and lots of data. Maps doesn't just use GPS to find, but also a huge database of home and business Wi-Fi networks the company has mapped out over the years via crowdsourcing and Street View cars. You can set your phone to GPS-only, but what if you want to hinder Google from collecting data on your Wi-Fi network? There's a solution for that: Just add "_nomap" to the end of your SSID. </p>
<p> The FCC has just approved rules allowing unlicensed use of 1,200MHz of spectrum around the 6GHz band. This very technical-sounding government announcement has huge consumer implications, though. The frequencies will pave the way for a new generation of Wi-Fi — likely to be called Wi-Fi 6E — that will provide plenty of benefits. While your existing devices can't use it, it will mean faster and better Wi-Fi performance, especially in congested city environments where the existing 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands are stretched to their limits. </p>
<p> These days, most people connect to the internet via Wi-Fi. We've been taught that on unprotected, open hotspots, you can easily be followed around the web, but generally, we would assume that password-protected networks are relatively safe from outside attacks. As it turns out, a vulnerability in the widely used Wi-Fi protected access 2 (WPA2) protocol lets hackers view unencrypted connections on these networks, even if they don't know the password. Patches are already rolling out to current routers and client devices, leaving only older, unsupported hardware indefinitely affected. </p>

<p> Google is working on a Phone Hub similar to Microsoft Your Phone that will make your handset interact better with your Chromebook, but the company isn't ready to bring the feature to stable just yet. In the latest release of Chrome OS, version 85, the company instead focuses on many little things that make for an overall better experience: Wi-Fi password sync, improved settings search, and a volume slider for your microphone. </p>
<p> Getting all your devices logged in on a new Wi-Fi network can be a hassle: entering the same password again and again, hoping you don't make any mistakes. Google started experimenting with ways to simplify this process last year when Chrome OS Canary started syncing Wi-Fi passwords with other devices. That feature never rolled out widely, leaving us to wonder if its development had stalled. Thankfully that wasn't the case, and now Google is working on a new and improved Wi-Fi syncing solution for Chrome OS. </p>

<p> If anyone knows the internet, it's Google. So it makes sense that its Wifi routers are some of the most well regarded products in its hardware lineup. Google expanded Nest Wifi's availability to more countries last month — and with people around the world spending so much time at home these days, it's no wonder. Now users with Nest Wifi and Google Wifi systems are about to get their home internet upgraded, because the company is rolling out an update that will improve performance on slower Internet connections. </p>

<p> With it likely your home Wi-Fi network is dealing with more devices in more places than ever these days, it's not surprising if you've considered making the upgrade to a modern mesh network system, or whether one of those cheap range extenders will get the job done for adding coverage to some rooms of your home. In our experience, this is one area where dropping cold, hard cash really is the only bulletproof solution. While there are situations where a simple range extender can get the job done, they're such an imperfect solution that they may just end up just making you want a mesh system more in the end. </p>
<p> Android 10 brought with it the ability to share WiFi networks through QR codes, an incredibly useful feature for temporary guests and visitors. Even though Samsung makes a lot of changes to Android, it kept this feature in One UI 2.0. Here's how to share and scan WiFI networks on your Samsung smartphone running Android 10. </p>
<p> Mesh WiFi networks offer a great way to blanket your home in strong wireless coverage, keeping all your devices connected. But as our needs grow, occasionally it becomes time to augment that network with some additional access points. If you've got an existing Orbi Whole Home Mesh WiFi network, now's your chance to upgrade, as Amazon has the Netgear Orbi WiFi Satellite Extender for $50 off, blowing past even Black Friday deals. </p>
<p> CES 2020 gave the networking device market a solid head start for the rest of the year. We not only saw a more capable Wi-Fi standard come into being but also mainstream brands jumping in with a pile of new routers and mesh systems. Besides an expanded security camera lineup, D-Link’s CES announcement includes a long list of routers and range extenders that integrate the EasyMesh and Wi-Fi 6 standard. </p>
<p> The latest Wi-Fi 6 standard was established to increase the efficiency of the 2.4GHz and 5GHz spectrum that users have been relying on for decades. Unfortunately, as more of the devices we buy eat up precious bandwidth, these connections can still become congested and slow down like a highway during rush hour. To usher in a faster, more capable generation of high-speed data, the Wi-Fi Alliance has announced a new 6GHz spectrum dubbed Wi-Fi 6E. </p>

<p> Qualcomm revealed the budget Snapdragon 768G just last month, but now the company is announcing another System-On-a-Chip intended for mid-range devices. The Snapdragon 690 will appear in phones later this year, and it aims to bring 5G connectivity to more affordable price points. </p>

<p> Wi-Fi 6 has been around for months, if not years, but we’re yet to see a wave of mass-market routers and mesh systems supporting the latest standard — even Google’s Nest Wifi eschewed it. That is set to change in 2020 as mainstream networking brands like TP-Link are already taking the lead. The company yesterday refreshed its Deco line of mesh routers with three new systems that bring the wireless protocol to more price segments. </p>
<p> The Wi-Fi Alliance thinks that all that 802.whatever business was becoming too complicated, so get ready for a simpler naming scheme for your favorite wireless standards. For now on, the upcoming 802.11ax standard will be called Wi-Fi 6. The Alliance is also retconning past standards to match the new naming approach. </p>

<p> Wi-Fi 6e </p>
<p> A few days ago, Google asked the FCC if it could do some testing in 17 states for the new 6GHz bands that were recently freed up for Wi-Fi and other use cases. We know the ultimate technical goal — Google claims it wants to measure signal characteristics in real-life applications and environments so it can improve its technical understanding of things like signal propagation and Automatic Frequency Coordination — but redactions in the public-facing experimental license request spark the imagination. </p>
<p> The new bands that the upcoming Wi-Fi 6E standard depends on have only recently been approved for use by the FCC, but Qualcomm's been ready and waiting. The company has just announced two new products that will be Wi-Fi 6E compatible when they eventually land in as-yet-unannounced chipsets, with the higher-end version available in hardware as soon as the 2nd half of this year. </p>

<p> Wi-Fi Protected Setup authentication, or WPS for short, disappeared from Android 9 Pie in an intentional move by Google due to security concerns, although it then promised that the feature would return in a future Android release, although perhaps in a slightly different form. Instead, Android Q supports a similar technology called Wi-Fi Easy Connect. </p>
<p> Huawei has had a rough week — it was added to the US Entity List, and soon it will be cut off from most of the manufacturers and companies it relies on to make products. While perhaps not the most devastating blow Huawei has been dealt in recent days, it has now been excluded from the associations responsible for the development Wi-Fi, SD, and some USB standards. </p>
<p> The vast majority of people out there don't know much about network security, if at all, but thankfully there are talented groups and individuals out there who are on constant lookout for flaws and vulnerabilities. Each security protocol we've seen has had some kind of issue (sometimes crippling), but the still-young Wi-Fi Protected Access protocol version 3, aka WPA3, remains vulnerable to attack, thanks to some pretty serious design flaws. </p>
<p> Back in March, a trusted source revealed to us that a Palm-branded Android smartphone was slated to launch on Verizon in the second half of 2018. We haven't heard anything since then, but a Palm device with model name 'PVG100' has just rolled through both the FCC and Wi-Fi Alliance. </p>
<p> The original NVIDIA SHIELD (before the Tablet or the set-top box, so just called "SHIELD" at the time) was a surprise revelation at CES 2013. This high-powered Android device with an Xbox-style controller and a flip-up screen was unlike anything we had seen before, and though it never became a runaway hit, many (including yours truly) have been hoping that NVIDIA would update the design in addition to its more conventional SHIELD entries. Get your thumbs ready: it looks like a SHIELD 2 is being certified by both the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth trade groups. </p>
<p> NVIDIA has just announced that the Tegra 3 chip will support the Wi-Fi Alliance's upcoming wireless display technology, called Miracast. Miracast uses Wi-Fi Direct to wirelessly deliver HD content - including movies, images, and games -from mobile devices directly to supported devices, like HDTVs and set-top boxes. </p>
<p> For an example of what will be possible with Miracast, have a look at this: </p>
<p> The Miracast wireless display certification program should launch within the coming months, enabling display manufactures and other vendors to start incorporating the standard into future devices. We've reached out to NVIDIA to get a bit more information on whether or not the standard could be incorporated into Google TV devices and the like via a firmware upgrade, and will update when we hear something back. </p>

<p> Google's long-term plans for its MVNO carrier, Project Fi, remain uncertain. But for the time being, the carrier is continuing to roll out new software features. No, Fi isn't getting RCS support — but it is starting to test an always-on VPN service and improved network switching. </p>
<p> We've heard a number of rumors about Google launching its own Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO), codenamed Nova. According to reports, the service will source wireless service from Sprint and T-Mobile, but it will rely on Wi-Fi networks to bear most of the weight of both data and voice services (though VoIP). While the details of this plan still aren't clear, another piece of the puzzle just emerged that indicates Google is going to offer its own virtual private network (VPN) service, and it may be targeted specifically at Nova subscribers. </p>
<p> This information resulted from a tip we received a few days ago, pointing us in the direction of a new application called Google Connectivity Services. </p>

<p> wi-fi calling </p>
<p> If you use Google Voice, but are still able to catch most of your calls with your primary device, you may have encountered some funny behavior where they either pop up quickly, then disappear, and then either ring the phone again or move onto their other linked devices. The company has acknowledged the problem and, unfortunately, says it'll be sticking around for a while. Here's what you can do to get around it. </p>
<p> Even after a major rebranding last year that made most Android devices compatible with Google Fi, users have to choose either a Google phone or a specially adapted one from the likes of Motorola to get the full Fi experience. That's because "designed for Fi" phones have unique modem and firmware tailored for the company's MVNO network to enable special features like automatic networking switching. Today's announcement from the Google Fi team, however, should make non-Google phone owners feel less left out, as the company is rolling out some hitherto Fi-only features to more Android devices, such as spam call warnings, Wi-Fi calling, and VPN protection. </p>
<p> With all the recent issues cropping up on the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, it's probably about time for some good news, right? As it turns out, the Pixel 3 on AT&T has access to network features most other unlocked phones don't — including Wi-Fi calling, HD voice, and creating a hotspot. </p>
<p> It's always been hard to explain what Google Voice is because it feels like a VoIP service, but it's not. Google Voice has operated as a phonecall relay system all these years, forwarding your calls through another number. Earlier this year, Google started beta testing Wi-Fi calls in Google Voice, and it looks like the feature is rolling out to more users. </p>
<p> For mobile users juggling a bunch of different devices, Google Voice can be something of a godsend. Not only does it let you share a single point of contact through which people can reach you no matter which phone or tablet you're carrying at the moment, but it does so without requiring the party on the other end to install a specific app — everything travels over regular voice calls and text messages. </p>
<p> With the launch of Google's Pixel devices, consumers have to make the choice to buy from Verizon, the Google Store, or Project Fi. Unlocked phones sold outside the carrier sometimes don't work with carrier-specific features, like Wi-Fi calling. Thankfully, both Verizon and Google have confirmed to Android Police that all Pixel phones will work with Wi-Fi calling and HD voice on Verizon. </p>
<p> Google's statement says that even Pixel phones purchased through Project Fi will work fine with those features. This essentially means there is no reason to buy a Pixel phone through Verizon, as they will work identically. Buying the Pixel from them actually has some downsides, namely the locked bootloader. </p>
<p> Far be it from humble Android bloggers to tell a multi-billion-dollar telecom corporation what to do with its nigh-infinite resources. But when you're rolling out something that your competitors have offered for some time, it's usually prudent to make it available to as many people as possible. That doesn't seem to be the case for AT&T's Wi-Fi calling feature. The first phone to get it is the Galaxy S7... no, wait, sorry, I made a mistake. That's the choice that would make sense. The first phone to get AT&T Wi-Fi calling is the LG G4. </p>
<p> Last year Verizon Wireless launched Advanced Calling, a VoLTE service with video calling support on select phones. Now the carrier is pushing Advanced Calling 2.0. An over-the-air update is on its way to the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. </p>
<p> T-Mobile users with the latest devices (and sometimes with the latest software updates) appreciate the inclusion of Wi-Fi calling for those areas where the network doesn't reach or can't penetrate indoors. Of course, the fact that Wi-Fi calling is available is a good reason to abstain from flashing custom ROMs, even on multi-carrier devices like the latest batch of Nexus phones. Apparently that won't be a problem for much longer, at least if you're a fan of the CyanogenMod ROM. </p>
<p> Cyanogen Inc. employee (and former leader of the AOKP ROM team) Roman Birg posted the screenshot above to Google+, clearly showing T-Mobile Wi-Fi calling on an AOSP-style software build. </p>
<p> Vodafone UK announced its own Wi-Fi Calling service earlier this month, but support remains extremely limited. As of right now, the only devices listed are the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Fortunately that's about to change, though not by much. Android compatibility is coming in the form of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. </p>

<p> wifi calling </p>
<p> We live in an era when phones often support a dozen or more LTE bands, making them functional on virtually all carriers. Simply working on a carrier might not be enough anymore. There are advanced network technologies like VoLTE and WiFi calling that require device makers and carriers to collaborate to test and certify phones. The GMSA has taken note of this clunky process, and is now working with its partners to develop an open standard for delivering carrier features to more phones. </p>
<p> If you're not a Sprint customer who's in-tune with all the carrier's quirks and features, you probably haven't heard of Calling PLUS. After all, only three phones currently support it - that is, until now. The LG G6 has become the fourth Sprint phone to support Calling PLUS with this latest update. </p>
<p> VoLTE and WiFi calling are both features that have existed on multiple carriers for some years now, but until now, Sprint devices haven't been able to use them in conjunction with each other, save for two rather unimportant devices. The latest updates for the Sprint Galaxy S8 and S8+ enable Calling PLUS, Sprint's lingo for its VoLTE - WiFi calling combo. </p>
<p> With the launch of Google's Pixel devices, consumers have to make the choice to buy from Verizon, the Google Store, or Project Fi. Unlocked phones sold outside the carrier sometimes don't work with carrier-specific features, like Wi-Fi calling.

This essentially means there is no reason to buy a Pixel phone through Verizon, as they will work identically. Buying the Pixel from them actually has some downsides, namely the locked bootloader. </p>
<p> In recent years, WiFi calling has become increasingly prevalent on various carriers and devices; the recently-announced Pixel and Pixel XL back up this fact. Google has confirmed that the Pixel smartphones will support WiFi calling for both T-Mobile and Verizon upon launch. </p>
<p> The Verizon-exclusive Droid Turbo 2 was released almost a year ago, and promptly made headlines with claims of a shatterproof screen. Verizon and Motrola have at least made an effort to keep the device updated, compared to other devices on Big Red, and it even received Android 6.0 Marshmallow earlier this year. Now owners of the Turbo 2 can finally use WiFi calling, courtesy of a software update. </p>
<p> An update, titled '24.31.22.kinzie_verizon.verizon.en.US,' is being pushed to all Droid Turbo 2 devices with the "Latest Android™ security updates and bug fixes," as well as full WiFi calling support. </p>
<p> AT&T and Samsung are both notoriously bad with Android updates, but they've done a good job with this latest update for the Galaxy Note5 and the Galaxy S6 edge+. Not only does this update bring the latest security update, but it also adds support for AT&T WiFi calling and Advanced Messaging. </p>
<p> Nearly a year after Android 6.0 Marshmallow first debuted on the Nexus 5X and 6P, the AT&T models of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and Note Edge are finally receiving an OTA for 6.0.1. Samsung has never been reputable for fast updates, and neither has AT&T. This incredibly late update is what happens when you mash the two together. </p>
<p> With the almost limitless number of Android devices on the market, the amount supporting WiFi Calling on AT&T is somewhat limited. The first Android device that AT&T allowed into the WiFi calling club was the LG G4, even after the LG G5 had been available on the network for some time. </p>
<p> Aside from the G4, the only other supported devices were various iPhone models, a few recent Samsung flagships, and two other LG phones. Now the LG V10 is joining that list, with a software update pushing out to owners with the new feature. </p>
<p> The update, with a build number of MRA58K, apparently only includes the addition of WiFi calling; sorry if you got your hopes up for a Nougat update. </p>
<p> AT&T started rolling out WiFi calling to some of its devices a few months ago, starting mysteriously with the LG G4. The GS6 Active and LG K10 followed that, but now a pair of newer flagship phones finally have it too. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are getting WiFi calling in the latest OTA. </p>

<p> We've been taking a thorough look at smart monitoring cameras here on Android Police, but the overarching complaint in most of them from us and you, the readers, is always the price and the paid plans. That's why for my next two reviews, I will be focusing on two camera makers that don't require you break the bank to buy their hardware nor to use it. The first brand is Reolink and I'll be reviewing two of its cameras: the Keen ($119.99) and the Argus ($99.99), both of which offer MicroSD storage. (The second brand is Amcrest, which I'll review in a week or so.) </p>
<p> Despite trying out many brands, Canary is still one of my favorite connected cams but its software keeps advancing at a very slow pace and competitors are starting to catch up. That's why I was happy today to see several new features coming to Canary... until I realized most of them require a Membership subscription. Why does everything good in tech these days require a monthly bill? </p>
<p> Alright, I'll stop crying over my empty wallet now and start explaining what the new features are. </p>

<p> If you’re looking at making your home safer, security cameras are a great way to keep an eye on your property and receive alerts in case something might be wrong. Thanks to this deal on Arlo Q Wi-Fi cameras, you can save $73 on a two-pack bundle, down to $203. </p>
<p> Home security used to be something you couldn't effectively do yourself, but recent advances in connected cameras and alarms have changed things. Home security cameras you can monitor yourself can be pretty affordable, especially with sales like this one: you can currently grab Logitech's Circle 2 security cameras for $80 off. </p>
<p> A couple of weeks ago, we shared with you a deal for Arlo's Pro 2 cameras, but it was only for the 6-pack of cams. If you don't have a large surface to cover and you're interested in getting a new security system (or adding to your existing one), today's deals might be right up your alley. </p>
<p> Honeywell, a brand that's well known for its thermostats, also builds some smart and connected products. Previously, these were all controlled by the Honeywell Lyric app, but now that's being rebranded to Honeywell Home with plenty of under-the-hood and visual/functional changes. The company is also introducing new paid plans for its security cameras. </p>
<p> Netatmo's approach to security cameras is refreshing. In a market that's filled with companies limiting what you can do with the hardware you bought just in order to get you to sign up for a monthly subscription, Netatmo asks only that you purchase its camera. Video storage is free thanks to MicroSD card support as well as optional Dropbox and FTP uploads. Face recognition is free and gets better with time as it learns. A web app is provided so you can monitor everything from your computer, not just your phone. And privacy is respected because nothing other than a backup screenshot is sent to the Netatmo Cloud. </p>
<p> You know what users like even less than a company that takes features away from them? It's a company that doesn't seem to make up its own mind about what it wants and doesn't want to offer them. </p>
<p> The story of Canary goes like this: the company made a nice connected security camera that I actually loved. In September of 2016, Canary changed its plans to introduce Membership, but caused an uproar because it forced all paid users into a $9.99 plan and took away the cheaper but good-enough-for-most-users $4.99 option (initial plans screenshot), and it also changed the free plan from 12hrs/camera to 24hrs total, divided on all the cams you had: 24hrs for 1 = double, 12hrs for 2 = same as before, 8hrs for 3 = bad, and it only gets worse from there. </p>
<p> In her review, Rita called the Blink indoor home security camera "an interesting proposition that falters in execution." In spite of its shortcomings, one of the Blink's virtues was its battery life. Both the original Blink and the outdoors-ready Blink XT run on two AA lithium batteries, with two years of battery life under normal use. Now Blink is doubling down on that strength without hampering its cameras by enabling three video recording modes: Saver, Standard, and Best. </p>
<p> Blink has an interesting proposition as a connected security system: one sync module that plugs into MicroUSB for power but connects to your network over WiFi, and 1 to 10 completely wireless cameras that you can place anywhere without worrying about power or connection cables. They only get triggered by motion and record short clips (max. 60sec) then go back to idling. When I reviewed the system last week, I found the idea promising but complained about the slow app and the missing hardware features: no weatherproofing and no night vision were big deal-breakers for me, and the 720p resolution was limited too. </p>
<p> When I first heard about the Blink security cameras, I was immediately impressed and intrigued. Having tried both the Piper and Canary in my pharmacy, to more or less mitigated results, the Blink seemed like the perfect solution. </p>
<p> Piper (full review) suffers from one major flaw: the camera doesn't turn itself back on after a power failure if the back-up battery is empty (and since we have lots of blackouts here in Lebanon, I got tired of buying new batteries every two or three weeks). It also doesn't have a native scheduled arm/disarm feature; I really shouldn't have to manually arm and disarm my cameras when a simple time-based schedule is easy to implement. </p>
<p> There are plenty of choices when it comes to security cameras, but for the longest time, most of them needed to be tethered to electricity and couldn't be placed outdoors. Now, lots of companies like Nest and Canary are releasing outdoor-friendly cameras, but Arlo has been doing it for a while before them. The wireless Arlo security cam system is comprised of one smart home base connected to power and your router, and one or several small cameras interspersed around your house or business. </p>

<p> Wi-Fi doorbell </p>
<p> If you're looking for an easy solution to keep an eye on your front door without breaking the bank, take a look at Eufy's smart doorbell. It usually sells for about $160, but you can snatch it for just $100 on Amazon this Black Friday. </p>
<p> If you're looking for a convenient way to keep an eye on your front door but don't want to break the bank, Eufy has got you covered with its video doorbell. It normally sells for around $160, but you can snatch it for just $100 thanks to this coupon code. </p>
<p> Smart doorbells are a convenient way of adding an extra layer of security to your household, but they can be quite pricey and often require an additional monthly subscription. Of course, there are a few inexpensive options, but their resolution is usually limited to 1080p, which is decent, but not on par with new 4K standards. Eufy's approach offers a good compromise with great value for money, thanks to its 2K image quality at a reasonable price and with no monthly fees. The intelligent doorbell normally costs $160, but you can get it for just $112 thanks to this promo code. </p>

<p> wi-fi hotspot </p>
<p> Android P will come packing so many new features that it’s hard to keep up with what’s changed. One helpful function that slipped under our radar is the ability to have your Wi-Fi hotspot turned off automatically when no devices are connected. </p>
<p> Does a new mid-range Android phone on AT&T get your juices flowing? And by new, I mean one that was actually already announced last month? Fantastic, because I'm here to tell you about the Galaxy Express, Samsung's newest phone on AT&T that isn't a Galaxy S III. Here's a really big picture of it: </p>
<p> Not actual size. </p>
<p> Still interested? Then you may want to know what's inside this 4.5" middle-of-the-road monster. </p>
<p> 4.5" SAMOLED+ WVGA (480x800) </p>
<p> Dual-core 1.5GHz CPU (I'm guessing TI OMAP - but hey, it could be an S4) </p>
<p> 5MP rear camera, front camera of some resolution (probably VGA) </p>
<p> 2000mAh battery (pretty good for a mid-ranger) </p>
<p> Android 4.0 </p>
<p> 4G LTE </p>
<p> MicroSD slot </p>
<p> You'll be able to get your hands on this beast starting November 16th, for just $99.99 on a new 2-year agreement. </p>

<p> When Lollipop 5.0 first launched, it brought with it an interesting set of dynamic Quick Settings toggles. Drop down your notification shade and you could see the usual culprits like WiFi and Bluetooth, but a few toggles were hidden unless they were triggered once, like WiFi Hotspot or Invert Colors. The problem, however, was that once these showed up, they were there to stay ... at least for one month if you never touched them again. </p>
<p> The announcements are coming fast and loose out of Mobile World Congress. Huawei has been steadily sharing new phablets, watches, and more. One of the less conventional gadgets to join the company's lineup includes a Wi-Fi hotspot designed for automobiles, dubbed CarFi. It has been designed to share a 4G LTE connection with up to 10 devices simultaneously, and it doesn't look half bad. </p>
<p> CarFi is similar to many other cellular hotspot devices, but it plugs directly into the DC port found in most cars and trucks. </p>
<p> There's good news for frequent international travelers and Fon users alike today. Fon and AT&T have entered into a mutually-beneficial agreement to let each other's users access both networks when out and about. So AT&T International WiFi users will have access to Fon's distributed WiFi hotspots without having to buy the Fonera hardware, and Fon users won't have to pay an access fee on the AT&T WiFi hotspots that still charge one. </p>
<p> It could only last so long. Boy Genius Report received a tip today that T-Mobile USA is making preparations to follow other carriers' foot steps and is going to start charging for tethering on November 3rd. The $14.99 monthly plan is a surcharge on top of an obligatory $19.99 Unlimited Web plan, so don't go thinking you can replace one with the other. </p>
<p> T-Mobile was once praised for turning a blind eye to device tethering and portable WiFi hotspot functionality, but times are tough, so what better way to make money than charging customers for the same data twice? </p>

<p> wi-fi-only </p>
<p> The latest post to the official Google Maps blog brings some welcome news. A couple of features that have been exclusive to betas of the Android app, not to mention hinted at by our cheeky teardown posts, are now in the public version. Specifically, that handy Wi-Fi-only mode for users on a limited data allotment should now be live for everyone (it was limited to a subset of users before), and the option to save local mapping data to the SD card is now active as well. </p>
<p> A couple of very useful features have started rolling out to a few lucky Google Maps users in the last couple of days. If you've been following along with our APK Teardowns, you might remember sections covering notifications for mass transit delays and an option to restrict data usage to Wi-Fi only. If you've been eager to see either of these, now might be a good time to open up Maps and poke around. But it looks like both features are launching as staged rollouts, so don't be too surprised if you're not in the opening group. </p>
<p> YouTube Music, the app built specifically for the YouTube Red music subscription service, is still somewhat in its infancy. There's plenty of room for improvement, and version 1.16 adds a couple of small but notable changes to better the listening experience. First, the standard Watch page (the one with the actual video on it) now has a "More from..." button, with the ellipses replaced with the relevant artist for each video. It allows users to find more music from that specific artist. Makes sense. To see the button you may need to expand the viewer in portrait mode. </p>
<p> If you really want Samsung's Galaxy Camera (our review), but aren't into the idea of being tied down to a carrier so you can take pictures, it's your lucky day. The company just announced the Galaxy Camera Wi-Fi, which quite frankly makes a whole lot more sense, anyway. </p>
<p> Essentially, the Galaxy Camera Wi-Fi is exactly like its cellular-connected counterpart in terms of pure spec (and aesthetics): </p>
<p> Image Sensor: 16.3 effective megapixel 1/2.3" BSI CMOS </p>
<p> Lens: 21x Optical Zoom Lens, 23 mm Wide Angle, F2.8 (W) ~ 5.9(T) </p>
<p> IS: OIS </p>
<p> Display: 121.2 mm (4.8"), 308 ppi, HD Super Clear Touch Display </p>
<p> ISO: Auto, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200 </p>
<p> Processor: 1.4GHz quad-core processor </p>
<p> OS: Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) </p>
<p> Memory: 8GB (including read-only sections such as Android operating system) ＋ memory slot : micro SDSC, micro SDHC, micro SDXC) </p>
<p> Image: JPEG format 16M, 14M, 12M Wide, 10M, 5M, 3M, 2M Wide, 1M </p>
<p> Video: MP4 (Video: MPEG4, AVC/H.264, Audio: AAC); Full HD 1920x1080 30fps; Slow motion Movie 768x512 120fps </p>
<p> Unfortunately, there's no word on pricing or availability, despite the fact that the PR states that the device is being "launched today." </p>

<p> wifi-only </p>
<p> While we reported earlier today that Motorola Xooms would be receiving Android 3.2 "in small batches," the update is available now for those of you who have the wifi-only model. The update brings long-awaited features like app zooming and support for SD cards. </p>
<p> Users from the XDA forums have found a way to get that update without having to rely on carrier distribution, which is detailed below. It involves the Xoom Wifi Android 3.2 update, flashing ClockworkMod Recovery for the Motorola Xoom, configuring the Android SDK for your computer, and having adb functioning properly. </p>
<p> Although not yet officially announced by Dell, Amazon has made the Wi-Fi-only version of the Dell Streak 7 tablet available for pre-order on its website for $379.99. </p>
<p> The 4G version of Dell's latest tablet went on sale over a month ago, however its unsubsidized price on Amazon is $449.99. So, the sub-$400 price tag of the WiFi version of this tablet may be an attractive proposition for first time tablet purchasers looking to get their feet wet. </p>
<p> Now that we know that the Wi-Fi-only model of the Motorola XOOM is just around the corner (launching March 27 to be exact) perhaps you are looking for the best deal on the tablet. Costco's website may be the place to look, as they are offering not only a $10 discount (from the listed $600 price tag) but they are also throwing in a free gel case and shipping it to you for free. </p>
<p> It's another day, and we have yet another bit of news about the Wi-Fi-only Motorola XOOM. Only, this time, the news is nothing less than concrete and final, as Moto themselves announced that the carrier-free version of the the 10.1" beauty will be hitting store shelves on March 27 for $599. </p>
<p> The manufacturer lists the retailers who are lined up to carry the slate later this month, including: </p>
<p> RadioShack </p>
<p> While they tell us it will have a $599 price tag, we would recommend keeping an eye on Costco and Sam's Club (if you have a membership already), as they generally sell their goods at lower prices than other retailers. </p>
<p> Take it as you wish, but a flyer that (according to Droid Life) was passed out by Samsung representatives at a technology fair today clearly shows that a Wifi-only version of the original 7" Galaxy Tab is set to hit store shelves on April 4 at $399. </p>
<p> If this turns out to be legit, it may be viewed as a mixed bag by Android users. On the one hand, it's a quality tablet from a major manufacturer offered for $100 less than the iPad, but on the other hand, this isn't November and the original Tab's specs are easily dwarfed by the current generation of Tegra 2 slates that are becoming available. </p>
<p> The latest in a string of rumors about the upcoming Wi-Fi-only version of the Motorola XOOM comes from the team at Droid Life, who say that the carrier-free model may be hitting Staples stores on or around April 3. The same folks are also now reporting another leak from Staples which shows that employees will get the slate in their hands to begin training on March 23. </p>
<p> This dates come from a tip offered up by a Staples insider. </p>
<p> After last week's launch of the 3G (soon to be LTE) Motorola XOOM, many of us began to wonder about that cheaper Wi-Fi-only model that has been promised. We are still (agonizingly) without a confirmed release date, but those sitting on the edges of their seats in anticipation may want to know that the UK version has been priced at £449.99 ($732). </p>
<p> PC World's website announced the arrival and pricing of the much-anticipated slate, also advertising pre-orders (which were not active yet). </p>
<p> Do you love the Motorola XOOM but hate the idea of signing up for yet another contract? Looks like you might just be in luck - according to Maurizio Angelone, Motorola Latin America's General Manager, a WiFi-only version of the XOOM is very real and will, in fact, be launching in April. </p>
<p> Of course, it's always possible that the April timeframe will be exclusive to Argentina, and there's no word on pricing, but we can always hope it'll come to the States along with an iPad-esque $499 asking price. </p>
<p> Remember back when Samsung first introduced us to the Galaxy Tab, the tablet to save us Android fans from the iPad? They promised that a WiFi-only version would eventually come out for those who didn't want to pay for another data plan. </p>
<p> Well today, Samsung finally announced that it will be coming to the US in the first quarter of 2011. No dates have been given for international releases, but since this is a WiFi device, it should be easy to ship it over from the US for international use. </p>

<p> Google is working on a Phone Hub similar to Microsoft Your Phone that will make your handset interact better with your Chromebook, but the company isn't ready to bring the feature to stable just yet. In the latest release of Chrome OS, version 85, the company instead focuses on many little things that make for an overall better experience: Wi-Fi password sync, improved settings search, and a volume slider for your microphone. </p>
<p> We've all faced a similar situation: You're looking up some restaurants online, you find a nice one and want to call them up to make a reservation. Unfortunately, you end up dialing a wrong number and have to try again. Wouldn't it have been much easier if you could just click that number to call it from your phone? </p>
<p> It's already possible if you own Apple devices, but, surprisingly, Google's Android and Chrome OS don't communicate so seamlessly with each other. Nevertheless, this is about to change as the company may allow both operating systems to share clipboard, phone numbers, and Wi-Fi credentials with each other. </p>

<p> wi-fi problem </p>
<p> Last month it was revealed that Google Cast-supported devices were causing networking issues for many. After the story garnered widespread attention, Google quickly pushed out a fix in the form of the Play services 11.9.74 beta. Affected parties were able to manually install this version or jump into the testing program to get it, and it was supposed to fix the issue. But, that was a beta release that not everyone received (since betas are opt-in). The beta seems to have gone well, though, as Google has now pushed these fixes to everyone else via the latest stable release, v11.9.75. </p>
<p> A few days back we reported that the Google Home Max (among other Cast-enabled devices) might be connected with some recent reports for widespread Wi-Fi troubles. Google has indirectly responded to this issue in a page on the Device Support section for Google Home support, in which the company acknowledges the existence and cause of the problem, promising a fix tomorrow. </p>
<p> Update: According to HTC, this problem is currently only affecting the Tegra 3 (international) version of the One X - not the Rogers/AT&T One X or international One XL. HTC advises those affected to contact customer support, though the channel through which you purchased your device is a good bet as well, especially if it was from a carrier or brick and mortar store where they can exchange the unit immediately. </p>
<p> If you're a One X owner (or an avid XDA reader), you're probably aware that some poor souls have been basically unable to reliably use Wi-Fi on their devices because of a manufacturing defect. </p>

<p> wifi problem </p>
<p> Wi-Fi is a staple among most smartphone users. While we tend to talk more about cellular data, it's really just there to sustain us as we travel from one access point to another. We aren't just demanding more data at higher speeds, we're connecting more devices than ever before. The inevitable overcrowding of the 2.4 GHz brought about the expansion into the 5 GHz range. Unfortunately, many Nexus devices (and at least a few others) are having trouble making and maintaining connections to this higher frequency band. </p>

<p> If anyone knows the internet, it's Google. So it makes sense that its Wifi routers are some of the most well regarded products in its hardware lineup. Google expanded Nest Wifi's availability to more countries last month — and with people around the world spending so much time at home these days, it's no wonder. Now users with Nest Wifi and Google Wifi systems are about to get their home internet upgraded, because the company is rolling out an update that will improve performance on slower Internet connections. </p>
<p> We're all deeper into the coronavirus pandemic and that Wi-Fi router of yours just isn't cutting it anymore. You hate to see it, but for a lot of people, it's true. Well, if you've been looking into getting a mesh network and are considering getting a Nest Wifi system, you can save a good bit of money today through Woot's deal of the day. </p>
<p> There are some things in life you just can't have enough of: unconditional love, flash drives, USB-C dongles, and arguably even Wi-Fi routers. If you're looking to upgrade your aging router but have been scared off by steep prices, you're going to want to check out this Netgear deal at Walmart, where a shiny new router can be yours for a measly $20. </p>
<p> OnHub-schmonhub: two sources are now telling us that Google will introduce an own-brand Wi-Fi router called Google Wifi, and that the device will cost $129. A source that has proved reliable in the past has told us that the device will be launched alongside Google's Pixel phones, Google Home, and the 4K 'Chromecast Ultra' on October 4th. </p>
<p> That source additionally claims that Google will advertise the router as having "smart" features - probably similar to OnHub in some respects - and that Google will claim it provides enhanced range over typical Wi-Fi routers (a claim we see basically every router make, to be fair). </p>

<p> wifi security camera </p>
<p> Everyone and their mother seems to be making a stationary home security camera these days, but there are also an increasing number of 360-degree cameras. These small motorized units might be a preferable option, depending on what you need to keep an eye on. I tested the Yi Dome Camera a few months ago and found it to be overall pretty neat, but perhaps a little gimmicky. Lately, I've been using the EZVIZ Mini 360 Plus, which is very similar to the Yi 360. It's a low-cost camera that can rotate to get a full 360-degree view of the room. </p>
<p> The Mini 360 Plus is a touch cheaper than many home security cameras, and the design is cool. </p>
<p> Nest's new Cam has been available for a few months with its 1080p video capture and better WiFi signals, but it's not the cheapest connected security cam you can get for your home. If you've been wanting one but the $199 price was a little too hard to digest, you may be happy to know that the Cam has dropped by $25 online. </p>
<p> Both Amazon and Walmart are showing the new Nest Cam at a $175 price (minus a few pennies here and there) and that could be all the persuasion you need to grab one. Or if it was already on your Holiday shopping list, now might be a better time to jump the gun and get one. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/wifi-speaker/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17555585" filename="wifi-speaker">
<p> Right now on Amazon, you can get a great deal on an Ultimate Ears Megablast WiFi and Bluetooth speaker. On its own, the Megablast costs just $207, which is $93 less than the MSRP of $299. That's a significant saving, and it applies if you add the charging dock too. With it, the price is $247, adding $40 for the extra convenience. </p>
<p> Tis the season for deals and today there's more to be thankful about if you love great sound and even better features. One of our favorite audio brands, JBL, is having a big discount on many of its speakers. This includes small and more significant discounts on long-time Bluetooth favorites like the Clip 2 ($30 off), Charge 3 (a neat $60 off), Flip 4 ($20 off), and Xtreme ($150 off, half-price), but also really cool discounts on the newly announced streaming speaker range. </p>
<p> Scandinavian brand Urbanears is branching out of the headphones market to launch its first speakers: the Baggen and the Stammen. These are almost the same speaker made in two different sizes, wrapped in 360-deg fabric, and available in neutral colors like black, grey, and navy, but also interesting shades like light pink, dark green, and bold orange. </p>
<p> The reason we're talking about them is that they're connected speakers and come with plenty of integrations out of the box: Chromecast Built-in, Apple Airplay, and Spotify Connect. </p>
<p> Sonos makes some super expensive speakers. The name is the first that comes to mind when thinking about connected speakers, so much so that it's the first brand of speakers any company tries to support when it's entering some adjacent market in the smart home, connected home, or audio software/hardware space. While I doubt that I'd personally buy a Sonos speaker even if I had the money to spend on it, I know that a lot of people swear by their Sonos and would purchase more if they could. For those people, there's a new candidate in town vying for their wallet's wad of cash: the PLAYBASE. </p>
<p> The Amazon Echo and its integrated assistant Alexa have seen a lot of success and popularity over the past year, and now more companies have been tempted to build their own iterations of the product. Some, like Lenovo, have decided to nearly copy the entire idea, from the form factor to the Alexa integration. The result is the Lenovo Smart Assistant Speaker. </p>
<p> It's a cylindrical tower, much like the Echo, with a speaker grille at the bottom and what seems to be a rising control panel with volume and trigger buttons and an array of 8 360-deg far-field microphones with noise suppression that can pick up voices from up to 5m away. </p>
<p> I've never owned or used a Sonos speaker, but people who have say they are rather nice. They are also rather expensive. But, as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for. If you want a great sounding WiFi speaker system that works throughout your entire house, Sonos may just be the best in the business. </p>
<p> A whole home speaker system is one of the finer things in life, and do you know who enjoys the finer things in life? Dads, that's who. Amazon must know this, because they are offering a special promotion on Sonos speakers for Father's day. </p>

<p> wifi tether </p>
<p> It could only last so long. Boy Genius Report received a tip today that T-Mobile USA is making preparations to follow other carriers' foot steps and is going to start charging for tethering on November 3rd. The $14.99 monthly plan is a surcharge on top of an obligatory $19.99 Unlimited Web plan, so don't go thinking you can replace one with the other. </p>
<p> T-Mobile was once praised for turning a blind eye to device tethering and portable WiFi hotspot functionality, but times are tough, so what better way to make money than charging customers for the same data twice? </p>
<p> As you may know, the HTC EVO 4G comes with a mobile hotspot capability out of the box, even in Android 2.1, for $30 a month. </p>
<p> While Froyo (Android 2.2) will indeed include a similar mobile hotspot capability baked right into the OS, it is unknown at this point whether Sprint will rip it out before shipping to the EVO 4G customers or not. </p>
<p> Regardless of what will happen in the future, we are here now, and Sprint included a mobile hotspot app with the EVO that is in dire need of reviewing. </p>

<p> wifi xoom </p>
<p> Yesterday Motorola officially announced that Android 3.1 would be hitting Verizon 3G XOOMs first, then WiFi and other variants "in the next several weeks." I'm not really sure how Motorola defines "several weeks," but it appears to be a little bit different than the rest of the world, as we're starting to see reports pop up all over the net that suggest the update may already be underway. </p>
<p> That's about as deep as the details go for now, but if you get the update on your XOOM, make sure to let us know! </p>
<p> Yesterday at Google I/O, The Goog announced the next version of Honeycomb (Android 3.1), and said that the first tablet to see the update would be the Verizon version of the Motorola XOOM. Motorola followed up that announcement with an official statement today, including when the other XOOM variants could expect to see to get some updated Honeycomb action. </p>
<p> XOOM owners will be able to enjoy some nice improvements with this update, including support for the new Movies feature in the Android Market, resizable widgets, full support for the newest version of Adobe Flash player (10.2), which brings drastic improvements to performance and stability; and support for USB peripherals like game controllers, keyboards, and mice. </p>

<p> wiimote </p>
<p> Perhaps you recall the rash of Wiimote-related accidents seven or eight years ago. See, people got really, super into playing Wii, and sometimes the Wiimote just slipped and crashed into the TV. Motion Tennis Cast is kind of like Wii Sports Tennis, but you're controlling it with your phone. That's two expensive things you can break if the phone slips. </p>
<p> If you excuse the name (it started as an iPhone-only device), the iControlPad appears to be a pretty nice solution for "real" gaming on a touchscreen phone. Culled from left-over Open Pandora gaming console parts, the iControlPad includes dual analog sticks along with rear trigger buttons. The device pairs with your phone over Bluetooth, so it should be supported by your favorite emulators. Craig Rothwell of the iCP/OPP team has just posted a video updating folks on the status of the project, finishing by saying that we should see the iControlPad shipping out by the end of the month. </p>

<p> wikipad </p>
<p> When touchscreen controls don’t cut it for games, you’re left with two options: switch to a dedicated gaming machine or add your own hardware controls. For the past few years, Wikipad has sold its Gamevice detachable controllers which work with several Samsung Galaxy models and iPhones. The Google devices were sadly left out of the fray, until now as the company released a version that supports the Pixel 2, 3, and their XL variants. </p>
<p> On-screen and accelerometer controls work great for some mobile games, but other times you just want a real controller. Wikipad, the company behind the gaming-centric Wikipad tablet is introducing a new product called the Gamevice at CES. This is a split controller that expands and contracts to fit on your mobile device. </p>
<p> The Gamevice has what Wikipad calls a "flex bridge" design. Presumably the middle portion of the controller can be adjusted to snugly fit around your mobile device. The name probably refers to the vice-like grip it will have on your precious phone or tablet. It's a kind of pun, you see. </p>
<p> It's been a long road for the Wikipad, but in one short week, the odd little device will finally be available for purchase. After more than 18 months of development a complete redesign, the Wikipad will be launched next Tuesday, June 11th, at the reasonable price of $249 (including the unique controller add-on sleeve). The initial product push will be on Wal-mart.com, BestBuy.com, and TigerDirect.com, with more online and retail partners set to be announced after the E3 gaming show in July. </p>
<p> You could be forgiven for thinking the Wikipad tablet itself looks a lot like the Nexus 7, because it does, and not just on the outside. </p>
<p> One of these days, we're finally going to figure this whole buttons problem for Android devices. While touchscreens are great, the tactile feeling of physical controls will always have its appeal. Some solutions are better than others, but maybe the Wikipad can find the sweet spot. The tablet comes with an attached set of game controls that can be removed, leaving the player with a regular 7" Tegra 3 tablet. The entire unit costs $250. </p>
<p> Here are the specs for the tablet itself: </p>
<p> 7" 1280x800 IPS display (up to 5-point multitouch) </p>
<p> 16GB storage (expandable w/ 32GB micro SD) </p>
<p> 2MP front-camera </p>
<p> The attached buttons actually make this look a lot like a Wii U tablet, but this one is running Android 4.1. </p>

<p> Wikipedia Beta </p>
<p> The Wikipedia mobile app is a great way to access the site's massive wealth of information. The beta program for the Android app, as well as the separate Wikipedia Beta app, has just received a new update that drastically changes the reading list functionality. </p>
<p> Android 6.0 Marshmallow's text selection behavior changed, pushing the toolbar from the top of the screen to a floating one that pops up right above your finger. It also made this popup expandable and accessible to developers, some of which have since updated their apps to take advantage of this new option. First, Google Translate added a system-wide Translate button, making it possible for users to convert any word or sentence they come across into another language. Then Medium built a highlight and respond option inside the toolbar that only got triggered while using its app. Now Wikipedia's beta app has received an update to start searches from anywhere on your device. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/wildfire/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17548985" filename="wildfire">
<p> As of Sunday, more than 1.6 million acres across 13 states in the west have been burning in wildfires. The worst of them are located in California and Colorado and those areas are where AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon are providing specific responses to their customers. </p>
<p> With wildfires being more prevalent than ever in some parts of the world, it makes sense to improve the quality of information for those in the area. To better crisis response, Google will now show the boundaries of active wildfires via satellite data in near real-time. </p>
<p> If you've placed bets on when HTC will release its last smartphone (at least under its own name) and have marked that date prior to June of this year, you've lost your money. The financially-languishing Taiwanese phone maker still has some gusto left and it may look to continue getting its name out there one way or another. The latest news in its attempts to do so comes from Russia, where regulatory documents have indicated that the company will promote several new smartphones in the near future using a familiar name for longtime HTC fans. </p>
<p> The American Red Cross has been releasing a series of apps to help people deal with disasters. We've already seen apps dedicated to hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as one for first aid. The fourth app in the series just hit he Play Store, and this one's designed to keep people safe during a wildfire. </p>
<p> Much like the Hurricane and Earthquake apps, Wildfires can alert users of nearby fires and offer quick ways to stay safe: </p>
<p> Features Step-by-step instructions let you know what to do even before/during/after an wildfire, even if no data connectivity. • Get notified about current wildfires or wildfire-conducive weather. </p>
<p> Those following HTC's efforts to liberate bootloaders everywhere have a bit more to talk about tonight, as the Taiwanese manufacturer added support for a handful of devices. </p>
<p> For those not in the loop, HTC pledged to enable unlocking the bootloaders of all devices released after September 2011, but is doing the community one better by extending support to older models as well. HTC allows users to unlock their bootloaders using a quick, (relatively) easy online tool. </p>
<p> Among the newly unlockable devices are the original Desire, the Desire HD, Wildfire, and Wildfire S. To get started, just head over to HTC's Bootloader Unlock page. </p>
<p> Ever since the beginning of June, we've been teased by and patiently waiting for the mysterious AlphaRevX unlocker page that promised to completely unlock (S-OFF) the latest HTC Wildfire and even Incredible S, making root, custom ROMs, ClockworkMod recovery all possible. </p>
<p> After a period of private beta testing, the wraps have come off an hour ago, and the first public release of AlphaRevX is now available for download (see instructions below) for the following devices: </p>
<p> Incredible 2 and Desire S are not supported at the moment, though I suspect they use a similar protection scheme and will also be cracked shortly. </p>
<p> CyanogenMod 7 has earned its reputation as the most reliable Gingerbread ROM, even though it hasn't yet entered stable mode. And tonight, the fun goes on - RC4 RC3.14159265358979323846264338327, as the CM team so lovingly refers to it, has just been launched for all supported CM devices. </p>
<p> While RC4 doesn't contain any ground-breaking new features, it does bring a number of bug fixes - for example, hardware acceleration has been added to the Nook Color, and EGL has seen a big fix. It isn't perfect yet - kmobs notes that there may be some "lingering GPS issues on the EVO and the N1 call audio bug hasn't been fully fixed" - but it's still worth the update. </p>
<p> While the owners of HTC Wildfires have known for a while now that their devices would be eventually receiving Froyo, and that it probably wouldn't happen until Christmas, they were still secretly hoping HTC wouldn't take over 6 months to accomplish the feat. At least it looks like the company is keeping its word, which is refreshing nowadays, to say the least. </p>
<p> Starting this week, HTC will be rolling out Froyo to European Wildfire variants, with the rest of the world following sometime between now and February 2011. Better late than never, I suppose, although by then, we could be seeing Honeycomb and forgetting all about Froyo, let alone Gingerbread. </p>
<p> Today is obviously the day for popular applications to add QVGA support. As Rovio did only hours ago, Skype have added support for the increasingly-common 320x240 resolution in their application. That's good news for owners of the HTC Wildfire, Motorola Charm, Huawei IDEOS and LG Optimus T/S, who were left out in the cold until now. Skype for Android has had some nice bug fixes and improvements added, too: </p>
<p> Improvements: </p>
<p> 320*240 and 240*400 screen resolutions are now supported. </p>
<p> While the UK has had the Desire HD since early last week, the EVO look-a-like model and its sibling are only starting to trickle into Irish stores. Currently Vodafone appears to be the only carrier offering one of the new Desires, with the Desire HD available on pre-pay for €479 or €229 on an 18 month €35 contract. However, many Irish Android users appear to be holding out for their network of choice, Meteor, to announce the Desire HD and to a lesser extent the Desire Z. </p>
<p> Today Meteor released a press statement indicating that an end to that torturous wait is coming, although perhaps not as soon as hoped. </p>

<p> wileyfox </p>
<p> British company Wileyfox has had a whirlwind three years since it released its first budget devices back in 2015. The phones ran Cyanogen OS, but the startup that made the hardware ultimately didn't fare much better than the operating system itself, as Wileyfox entered administration last month in a bid to resolve a severe debt crisis. It was unclear if that would signal the end for the company, but apparently not entirely. </p>
<p> A community manager at Wileyfox has revealed on Reddit that Wileyfox is undergoing administration. For those of you not familiar with it, administration is a process in the UK where a company gives full control of itself to a person (or small group of people), in order to pay off debts to creditors. </p>
<p> TWRP is the recovery of choice for most power users - it's super easy to use, can be themed, and works on a massive number of Android devices. Over the past few months, the TWRP team has been working to expand the list of officially-supported devices. New additions include the Honor 6X, Wileyfox Swift 2X, Yoga Tab 3, various Galaxy phones and tablets, and more. </p>
<p> British smartphone maker Wileyfox has been using Cyanogen OS since it launched its first phone a few years ago. Thus, the demise of Cyanogen Inc. is a big problem for the company. A report making the rounds on the internet claims that Wileyfox has upped its game by hiring former Cyanogen employees as in-house devs, including former Director of System Engineering Ricardo Cerqueira. This claim is based on some very weak evidence, so we've reached out to get the real story. </p>
<p> UK smartphone maker Wileyfox has been one of Cyanogen Inc's most consistent partners lately, releasing new budget smartphones running the software on a regular basis. Cyanogen is over, but Wileyfox is forging onward with a new phone called the Swift 2X. It's running Cyanogen OS right now, which might be a problem, but it's also the most powerful (and expensive) phone the company has made. </p>
<p> Wileyfox is a tiny phone manufacturer based in Britain that focuses on solid budget and mid-range designs, with low profit margins partially enabled thanks to a partnership with Cyanogen Inc. for the phones' Android software. That partnership doesn't seem to be long for this world, after it was announced that Cyanogen is more or less shutting down its full Android development team. That leaves Wileyfox customers (among many others) in something of a lurch. </p>
<p> TWRP is an awesome tool for us Android enthusiasts; it allows users to make and restore backups, flash ROMs and other files, and is often the stepping stone to root access. Now, TWRP has become available for three smartphones and one Android TV device. </p>
<p> There aren't a ton of devices running the commercial Cyanogen OS ROM these days, but the Wileyfox Spark and Spark+ are two of the most prominent (which really tells you something). These UK phones launched with Cyanogen OS 12 (Lollipop) earlier this year, but now Cyanogen OS 13 is finally rolling out. </p>
<p> Phones have progressed enormously in the last few years. If I look at my beloved Nexus 4, bought new in 2012, it had a Snapdragon S4 Pro chip, 2GB RAM, and 16GB storage. It cost me £279, or $349 in the US. For a phone of that quality, $349 was a stupendous price, much cheaper than comparable phones from Samsung, Motorola, or HTC. It kept me going for two years before the battery finally gave out. </p>
<p> Fast forward to this year. A tiny British company, Wileyfox, has released a phone, the Spark, with 1GB RAM and 8GB storage, for £89.99 ($120). </p>
<p> Wileyfox and Cyanogen formed a partnership last summer to deliver smartphones running Cyanogen OS to Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. The Wileyfox Swift was the second phone to get version 13 of the operating system. Now the Wileyfox Storm is getting that same update. </p>

<p> TWRP is the recovery of choice for most custom ROM users. You can flash ROMs, manage your files in a pinch, install custom themes, and backup/restore your whole device. TWRP is also incredibly portable, meaning it is easily ported to more devices. Five more phones and tablets are now receiving official TWRP builds, and three devices now have a unified build. </p>
<p> CyanogenMod 13, based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, was formally released back in March, but it's only just arriving for some devices, in the form of nightlies. The most notable of these devices are probably the original HTC One and the Wileyfox Spark, plus the Spark X - the Spark's bigger, more powerful brother. </p>
<p> The HTC One is being bumped up from CM12.1, which was based on 5.1 Lollipop, while the Spark and Spark X are receiving their first taste of the custom ROM, albeit not their first Cyanogen flavored taste though, since they run the in-house Cyanogen OS, which has recently been killed off. </p>

<p> When I first picked this phone up, all I thought was "for £89.99, damn that is nice." It makes you wonder how Wileyfox does it; its previous phone, the Swift, was similarly received with exclamations of "how?!" when it launched for £129.99. </p>
<p> Onto the phone: it's very light, weighing only 136g. The screen, an IPS 5-inch display, seems to be bright and responsive, and the buttons are clicky. </p>
<p> Wileyfox are known - or rather, unknown - for their cheap, but well-specced smartphones. The Swift and Storm launched last year to generally good reviews, praising the affordability, performance, and design of the two phones, while criticising cameras and the occasional build quality issue. Today, the British company is announcing a range of phones, named Spark, Spark +, and Spark X. </p>
<p> The Spark is the most affordable handset of the three, costing just £89.99 ($120) off-contract. Despite this, it has a 5-inch, 720p IPS display, 8GB storage, two 8-megapixel camera, and runs CyanogenOS 13, based on Android 6.0 Lollipop. The processor is a quad-core MediaTek MT6735A running at 1.3GHz, with 1GB of RAM onboard. </p>

<p> LineageOS, the successor to the ill-fated CyanogenMod, is off to a great start. The ROM has already passed 600,000 active installs, and has steadily added support for more devices since launch. Now official LineageOS builds have expanded to several more phones and tablets. </p>
<p> Wileyfox and Cyanogen formed a partnership last summer to deliver smartphones running Cyanogen OS to Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. The Wileyfox Swift was the second phone to get version 13 of the operating system. Now the Wileyfox Storm is getting that same update. </p>
<p> Time to dust off your old phones. That Droid 4 in the back of your drawer, that Droid Bionic in the shoe box in your garage, and those RAZR and Droid RAZR that you can't even remember hiding or throwing away, they've all gotten a fresh breath of air. If you own of these you've probably scoured XDA's forums for months and found several custom ROMs based on Marshmallow for them, but if you prefer the CyanogenMod flavor in your ROMs then today is the day you can start flashing it. </p>
<p> But that's not all. Other devices are getting their first CyanogenMod 13 nightlies with Android 6.0 as well. </p>

<p> Wink recently caused an uproar when it launched a mandatory subscription plan out of nowhere, hindering anyone unwilling to pay from controlling their smart home hubs after a meager 14-day heads-up. The troubled company since backtracked and gave an indefinite extension of its free service, but of course, the business still wants to tap into a recurring income stream. It has announced that the $4.99-a-month subscription will become mandatory starting July 27, though this time around, free users will be able to retain some extremely limited functionality — if you even want to call it that. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/07 7:00am PDTon May 7, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/22 1:30am PDTon May 22, 2020. </p>
<p> Earlier this May, Wink announced out of the blue that it would charge customers $4.99 a month to continue using its services, or else their hardware would stop working. Following understandable customer backlash, the company first extended the cut-off deadline by a week, and has now indefinitely back-paddled, saying that it'll look for a new start date of the subscription. </p>
<p> Wink is a name that's decently well-known in the smart home space. Previously owned by the ill-fated Quirky, the home automation company got pawned off to Flextronics. Now, Wink will be joining i.am+, the firm founded by entertainer will.i.am. The sum of the acquisition is unknown right now, however, i.am+'s PR has confirmed the purchase. </p>

<p> The low-cost Sprint MVNO FreedomPop just launched its freemium phone service last month, but now it's expanding phone selection by letting users bring their own handsets. However, that doesn't mean you can take just any Sprint device over the FreedomPop and kiss your bill goodbye – there are some restrictions. </p>
<p> Spending too much on your phone service? You could maybe cut that bill down a bit, if you're willing to make a few sacrifices. How does free sound? FreedomPop, which previously started offering free mobile and home internet access, is expanding into phone service. For $0 per month, you can get 200 voice minutes, 500 texts, and 500MB of 3G/4G data. </p>
<p> This is obviously not a plan for heavy data users, but 500 MB might be workable if you're on WiFi most of the day. </p>
<p> In a post to the Android Building group earlier today, Jean-Baptiste Queru announced that Samsung's Nexus S 4G has officially and fully been brought into the AOSP fold. The device is now fully supported by AOSP, meaning its CDMA – and WiMax – binaries can now be "properly" distributed. Here's the full text of the announcement: </p>
<p> We've been able to resolve the issues around Nexus S 4G, and we can now properly distribute its CDMA and WiMAX binaries. </p>
<p> Sprint has long been the refuge for data-hungry users that don't want to deal with caps or overages. While Sprint's regular 3G and 4G data usage on phones is still unlimited, back in October the Now Network started capping the mobile hotspot feature at 5GB per month. Starting last Friday, May 18th, that plan is gone. In its place are two pricier options. </p>
<p> The low-end option comes with 2GB of monthly bandwidth and costs $19.99 per month. </p>
<p> If you've been looking to jump ship from the carrier juggernauts and get in on Sprint's promised "truly unlimited data", may we suggest now might be a good time to do so? From now until March 26th, all of Sprint's 4G phones (read: Sprint's best phones) are available for a penny with a new activation. Sorry upgraders. </p>
<p> Update 4/20/12: All Sprint Android phones are free again thanks to the Sprint Through Spring promotion... </p>
<p> It's only been a couple years since the EVO launched as not only the first WiMax phone, but the first "4G" phone (by carrier reckoning). Now, though, Sprint says that not only will there be no more WiMax phones, which we knew earlier, but no more WiMax devices at all. That means hotspots and tablets will also lack any WiMax antennae. Don't worry, though. Sprint has promised 15 LTE devices by year's end. </p>
<p> Sprint posted its fourth quarter earnings this morning, and they definitely painted a mixed picture of the company's financial position. On the one hand, the Alamo of unlimited data increased its subscriber base by 1.6 million in the last quarter, with big thanks likely owed to the addition of the iPhone to Sprint's lineup - giving them a significant advantage over their primary price point rival, T-Mobile. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, also because of the iPhone, the company managed a $1.3 billion net loss for the quarter, owed in large part to the massive cost of providing the device ($15.5 billion over 4 years) to customers at heavily subsidized price points. </p>
<p> It would appear that Sprint plans on going full speed ahead in focusing on product development for its 4G LTE lineup this year. David Owens, Sprint's VP of Product Development made clear at CES Wednesday that Sprint "won't be introducing any more WiMax smartphones," adding "April, May, June, July, August, those will be very aggressive times for us." This may be a hint that we could begin seeing LTE devices as early as April, which is great news for customers holding out for a new device (like Samsung's Galaxy Nexus, which is poised to be Sprint's first LTE device). </p>
<p> Update: Dow Jones Newswires apparently left out a key piece of information from Hesse's statement on throttling, in an example of truly stellar journalism and attention to detail (unfortunately, we have no audio or video record to verify Hesse's statements). Hesse was discussing throttling of those who are on networks that Sprint has roaming agreements with (which, admittedly, Sprint has a lot of - including with Verizon). While this still makes Sprint's ads technically misleading, the throttling really only applies to those who live in areas where Sprint's data network relies chiefly on roaming - not to those using primarily Sprint towers. </p>
<p> And so it begins - Android Police's First Annual Mega-Holiday Giveaway Series. For the next ten days, you'll have chances to win all sorts of awesome Android phones, tablets, and other goodies. (As a note to our international readers, this first contest features prizes that don't work outside the US, but don't worry, we have some more stuff coming for you later today.) </p>
<p> This contest is now over. Here are our winners, selected at random: </p>

<p> wimbledon </p>
<p> Remember when Google used to make its Android Easter eggs fun? My personal favorite is the Flappy Bird knockoff that was in Lollipop. If you, too, are a fan of Google's simple little Easter egg games, you may want to take a look at what it's drawn up for Wimbledon — a pixelated little tennis game. </p>
<p> For those looking forward to 2012's playing of what is widely considered the oldest (and most well-known) tennis tournament in existence, the official Wimbledon app hit the Play Store recently, bringing live scores, results, schedules, and more. </p>
<p> The app, despite its somewhat all-over-the-place UI, provides a ton of functionality, not only giving users information about the games, but also about players – Wimbledon's official app gives users player profiles, video previews, highlight reels, features, interviews and "golden moments" photos. If that isn't enough, players can tune in to three "Live @ Wimbledon" radio channels – one providing general "Daily Coverage" and two channels dedicated to Centre Court and No. </p>

<p> win </p>
<p> Fans of game shows have yet another thing to be happy about this Christmas. Yesterday HQ Trivia announced that it was bringing its live trivia app to Android. Although a date doesn't seem to have been set just yet, you can pre-register to be notified when the app goes live in the Play Store. </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy S7 is one of the most impressive Android smartphones released to date, and this is not just my opinion, but that of almost everyone I've talked to about the phone. It has a fantastic build quality and finishing, one of the best displays we've seen, a powerful processor (regardless if it's the Exynos or Snapdragon version), a capable camera, and decent-to-amazing battery life. </p>
<p> So how would you like to win one from us and our friends over at Ting? </p>
<p> You've sure heard of Ting, the MVNO that only wants to charge you for what you use instead of offering you plans with plenty of bundled options that you may never need. </p>
<p> At this very moment in time, the new Nexus 7 is probably the hottest tablet on the planet. There's a good reason for that, too: Google built on what it started last year with the first gen N7, improving it in almost every way. The new generation has a faster processor, double the RAM, and a higher-resolution display, just to name some of the most obvious changes. Early reviews of the device (worry not, ours is on the way) have praised it almost endlessly, proving that Google really hit the mark with its newest small tablet. </p>
<p> Naturally, as an Android user, you want this tablet. </p>
<p> Don't let your eyes deceive you. That is not a Galaxy S III (or IV) you're seeing. No, that is a new phone from Samsung. Yes, it has a name. You know what else it has? A 4.7" 800x480 display powered by a 1.2GHz quad core processor. What's that? You want to know the name? No, you don't. You want to hear about the 5MP camera, or the 8 whole GB of internal storage! </p>
<p> Let me tell you all about how this phone is a decent device for mid-range customers. Not cutting edge, but not too terrible, either. Hmm? You still want me to tell you the name? </p>
<p> For the past few weeks, I've been testing Hideman - a VPN solution with a feature set I've been seeking for a very long time. I've been using both Android and Windows apps to test the service, and let me tell you - it is everything I was hoping it would be and then some. </p>
<p> Hideman is available for the following operating systems: </p>
<p> Encouraging players to "go for the big win," Hothead Games recently released Big Win Football to the Play Store. The makers of the artistic masterpiece that is Machinarium and the similarly sports-minded Big Win Soccer have added another entry to their catalogue of "Big Win" sports games, bringing the same customizable, competitive and unique gameplay dynamic to football fans, allowing them to create their own customized dream team, play against opponents online, and enhance player skills with game-changing boosts. </p>
<p> One of the things that makes Big Win Football different from other football games, besides its Mii-like character style, is the ability to play big impact cards. </p>
<p> A court in Tokyo returned a favorable ruling for Samsung Friday, finding that Samsung's mobile devices were not in violation of an Apple patent related to inter-device media transfer. </p>
<p> This news comes one week after Samsung lost in what was (and continues to be) one of the most compelling trials tech has seen in a long time, with a San Jose jury ruling that Sammy owed Apple over $1 billion in damages over various trade dress and patent claims levied by Apple. By contrast, the jury awarded no damages to Samsung, finding that Apple didn't violate any of Samsung's patents and that all of Apple's patents retained validity. </p>
<p> If you listen to music on your Android phone (and who doesn't?) then you need PowerAmp. What is PowerAmp, you ask? It's probably the best music player for Android. It's packed with basically every feature you could possibly want in a music player, all wrapped up in a sexy looking package. And we have fifty licenses to give away to fifty different people. </p>
<p> This contest is now over. Here are our winners, selected at random: </p>
<p> Congratulations, guys - all of you will be contacted for your information in the near future! </p>
<p> A few days ago, we received a mystery package from the good folks at RadioShack. Inside the package were three phones - the Samsung Stratosphere on Verizon, HTC EVO Design 4G on Sprint, and Samsung Infuse 4G on AT&T. Since these phones are ours to do with what we please, we've decided to do what we always do when we end up with extra goodies: give them away. </p>
<p> Since we have three phones to hand out, we're going to make each contest quick and dirty. Each one will last for one day, and one day only. </p>

<p> winamp </p>
<p> The internet got all sad and nostalgic in November when AOL announced with little fanfare that Winamp was shutting down. The music player and streaming service had been whipping llamas for 15 years, and it seemed like a depressing and inauspicious end. AOL smartly held off on the shutdown when there appeared to be interest in buying Winamp, and that's just what happened. Winamp is being sold to Belgian online radio purveyor Radionomy. </p>
<p> Winamp has been around since 1997, and though it has amassed a large and faithful following in the years since, the good times are coming to an end. The software will cease to be available come December 20th. Anyone who visits the download page is now greeted by a message warning that they better grab the goods while they're still available, because they won't be a month from now. </p>
<p> The page doesn't explicitly mention the Android version, and there isn't yet a warning on either the Play Store or the app's website. </p>
<p> The variety of software that I've had installed on my different Windows computers over the past decade and a half has changed dramatically throughout time. However, there is one piece of software that I have had on every PC I've ever owned: Winamp. I first used Winamp at version 1, and have just stuck with it ever since; no matter how many other media players I tried, I always went back to Winamp. </p>
<p> Nullsoft, creator of WinAmp, a favorite media player for over 10 million Android users, is adding its premium track directly to the Android Market. Users have previously been able to download the Pro version via an in-app purchase, but now the Pro license is also available directly from the Android Market. So, what do you get for your $5? Here's a look at the feature list: </p>
<p> Customizable home screen </p>
<p> Browse by Folder </p>
<p> Crossfade </p>
<p> In what seems to be its biggest update since the initial release, the Winamp team just pushed some pretty major changes to Winamp for Android. For starters, this update now allows Mac users to sync with Winamp -- something that has previously been missing. Aside from that, there is now a pro version available, offering enough new features to easily justify the $5 pricetag: </p>
<p> 10-band graphic equalizer </p>
<p> A customizable home screen </p>
<p> The ability to navigate or browse your music by Folders </p>
<p> Crossfade between tracks </p>
<p> Gapless playback </p>
<p> Support for FLAC playback in Browse by Folders nav (lossless audio playback) </p>
<p> Replay Gain Support (configurable in Settings menu) </p>
<p> Personalized SHOUTcast station recommendations (based on music in your Android device) </p>
<p> The ability to play any streaming audio URL in SHOUTcast (supported formats only) </p>
<p> Ad Free </p>
<p> The update is available now in the Android Market -- hit the widget to grab it. </p>
<p> Listening to tunes on your Android device is serious business - no doubt about it. </p>
<p> It's so serious that many of us are pretty well set in our ways for what we consider the "choice" Android music-listening application, and we aren't willing to budge on it. </p>
<p> PowerAMP users, for example, swear by the application's seemingly endless list of customizations and options. On the other hand, Subsonic devotees like myself are advocates of what is probably the most configurable music streaming experience in existence. </p>
<p> Winamp feels incomplete without Shoutcast radio streaming support, and 2 weeks ago, some folks at DownloadSquad got their hands on a private beta version that had just that. Fast forward to today, and you can finally download the new Shoutcast-enabled v0.9.2 from the Market. </p>
<p> Top stations, search, favorites, recent, and genre browsing are all there and work exactly as expected. Now if only we could play custom .pls playlists, such as the one di.fm </p>
<p> Winamp, one of my favorite desktop music players, recently landed in the Android Market, and has since become one of my favorite mobile players as well, at least until PowerAMP came along. One glaring omission, however, has been the absence of Shoutcast streaming, meaning thousands of online radio stations (such as DI.fm) that are easily accessible via the desktop version, weren't available on mobile. I don't like having to use a whole different app just for radio, but, alas, I had to resort to using TuneWiki or XiiaLive, neither of which I was a fan of. </p>
<p> There is no shortage of media applications for Android - in fact, Winamp that came out last week was the most serious and robust media offering I've seen so far. However, when it comes to strictly the media player functionality, even Winamp can't touch what I'm about to show you - a new beta app called PowerAMP. </p>
<p> PowerAMP is an Android media player developed by a cool Russian dude by the name of Maxim Petrov (Max MP). </p>
<p> Have I gotten a treat for you music lovers? Winamp, the very first good music player for Windows - and one I still use religiously to this day - hit the Android Marketplace today, largely unnoticed in the Androidosphere. </p>
<p> It's still in Beta, but after using it for 15 minutes, I was so impressed that I set it as my default player and uninstalled the others. Let me tell you why, in the order of importance. </p>

<p> Wind Down </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/06/22 3:05pm PDTon Jun 22, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/27 10:41am PDTon Jun 27, 2020. </p>
<p> Unless you've been forcibly avoiding the news, you know iOS 14 is now a thing. But if you don't use an iPhone (or maybe even if you do), you might not have bothered checking out what was new in Apple's latest mobile operating system. But as fail to be basically every year we watch the WWDC keynote, no one on the Android Police was surprised to have one recurring thought: "hey, that feature looks familiar." Apple apparently felt very inspired by Android in the last year, and iOS 14 has a whole bunch of "world-first" innovations to show you that—very coincidentally!—also </p>
<p> Some subtle rebranding is happening inside Google's Digital Wellbeing app, which offers ways to monitor and manage your phone use. The previously named "Wind Down" mode is being renamed to "Bedtime mode," and the change brings a few other minor tweaks with it. </p>
<p> One of the pillar features of Digital Wellbeing is the ability to "wind down" your device. That means switching the display to grayscale to make time-sink apps like social media ones less visually appealing, and turning on Do Not Disturb to stop notifications from waking you up or grabbing your attention. However, this setting was the same for every day — you couldn't disable it on Saturdays but keep it running every other day. But now you can. </p>
<p> Google has just announced a "major" OTA update for all smart displays. Coming at the end of the month, the update will introduce some much-requested changes, such as multi-room audio grouping, as well as features shown off at the recent Made By Google event. That includes the Home View smart home device management; some trickle-over functionality from Digital Wellbeing; tighter Next Hello Doorbell integration; and new/improved control for devices including TVs, set-top boxes, speakers, and smart remotes — including the Logitech Harmony. </p>
<p> Android Pie is ready to look after your digital health, but only if you let it. The suite of features that were announced as part of Digital Wellbeing at I/O 2018 finally came to life when Pie 9.0 was released earlier this week, but you had to sign up for them, wait for an email, and then join the beta to get them on your device. Now, the process is much faster. </p>
<p> As they say, "If you haven't got your health, you haven't got anything." Most of us probably don't realize that there's more to the subject than just diet and exercise, and how we use our phones can have an impact, too. Once upon a time, our work/life balance was separated by real, physical distance, but thanks to the magic of mobile phones, we can all carry our work home with us in the form of life-interrupting notifications. That's not to mention social media's constant dopamine drip, which keeps us all scrolling like zombies and wasting away the best years of our life envying the lives of Instagram "influencers," or learning random, pointless facts from Reddit. </p>
<p> Today is P-Day, ground zero for the Android 9 phone invasion, but Google has an extra health-related surprise waiting with Pie's release. The Digital Wellbeing features shown off by Google at I/O didn't make an appearance during the Android P developer previews, but a test for the health-related tools has just launched. Interested Pixel-equipped parties can enroll in the beta starting today. </p>
<p> You would think that Google wants you on your phone as much as possible. That's where it can sell you ads and services in order to make money — that's its bread and butter. Yet Google CEO Sundar Pichai made a surprising announcement at Google I/O today. Upcoming new features in Android are going to help you get away from your phone and spend more time by yourself or with your family. </p>

<p> Regular followers of HTC's customer relations will recognize Mo Versi, the company's vice president of product management. He often gives out helpful information on his personal Twitter account, explaining when notable updates are coming for HTC phones and even giving support answers one at a time to his followers. He's considered, in the somewhat insular circles of Android-focused tech blogging, a good dude. And yesterday he gave out some good news: the HTC One M9 Marshmallow update is scheduled to hit a handful of Canadian carriers on Monday. </p>
<p> Great news for our Sasktel, Rogers, Wind and Videotron HTC One M9 owners! </p>
<p> Canada's mobile market might be only a fraction of the size of its southern neighbor's, but that's still millions and millions of potential customers. Shaw Communications, a major Canadian phone and Internet provider based in Calgary, is making a move to grab a portion of it. Yesterday Shaw announced its intention to buy Wind Mobile, the country's fourth-largest mobile carrier. Shaw will buy the company from its parent Mid-Bowline Group for 1.6 billion Canadian dollars (about 1.15 billion USD). </p>
<p> Wind has only been operating for almost exactly six years, and in an impressively short time has amassed just under a million subscribers in Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario. </p>
<p> Imagine the horror: one minute, you think you're finally getting Lollipop on your phone, the next your phone is soft bricked. That's the reality for owners of the 2014 Moto X on Canada's WIND Mobile, according to a flurry of reports on Reddit and elsewhere. At this point, the only surefire recourse seems to be bringing the phone to WIND to get it sent away for repair. </p>
<p> MotoX users experiencing update issues w/ Android L - we're working with @Motorola_CA to address the matter. Sorry for any inconvenience. </p>

<p> CrossOver is a commercial compatibility layer by CodeWeavers, based on the Wine project, which aims to run popular Windows software on Unix-based operating systems. CodeWeavers released the first beta of CrossOver for Chrome OS three years ago, and now it's finally ready for the masses. </p>
<p> Chromebooks were initially designed to be lightweight web-browsing laptops but gradually started gaining more features, especially when it came to offline computing. However, unlike macOS or Linux, Chrome OS doesn't have the ability to locally run Windows apps, which can sometimes be essential, especially when it comes to corporate apps. Back in June, Parallels and Google announced a partnership stating Chromebooks would soon be able to run Windows apps "seamlessly." The promise is now closer to reality, with the Parallels Desktop for Chromebook Enterprise set to be released this fall. </p>
<p> Last month, Google announced that Chrome OS was getting support for Windows apps via Parallels, and while we knew the "why?" much of the "how?" remained to be determined. But in an interview today with The Verge, Google is revealing more of the juicy details behind the change. </p>
<p> For more than three years, you've been able to save articles for later via Chrome on iOS. Google never cared to introduce the feature on other platforms, but it looks like that's about to change rather soon. An entry spotted in the Chromium Gerrit (via Techdows) shows that the company is working on bringing a Read Later feature to Chrome OS, macOS, Windows, and Linux. </p>
<p> No matter how much we slam Apple for its closed ecosystem, many of us often find ourselves raving about how well coordinated the iPhone and Mac are. Then we turn to Android, which just can't do all those tricks, leaving us feeling a little peeved— at least until Microsoft came into the picture. Microsoft has all but adopted Google’s mobile OS after its own phone business crumbled, and it has increasing sought to bridge the deep divide between Windows 10 and Android with the Your Phone app. </p>
<p> Chromebooks weren't originally designed to run traditional PC software, but Google is slowly attempting to fill that gap. Chrome OS already has an optional Linux container for running some desktop software (albeit with poor graphical performance), but now Windows applications will soon appear on the platform in some capacity </p>
<p> Microsoft and Samsung partnered up to bring us an enhanced version of the Your Phone service that connects Android phones with Windows machines. The Korean company promised to add even more exclusive improvements to the syncing utility for the Galaxy S20 and the Z Flip, like cross-platform copy and pasting and RCS support. As part of the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Build announcement, the partners took the chance to make good of that word. </p>
<p> Dark modes are becoming increasingly popular these days. Not only do they look cool, they can also save battery on AMOLED screens, as they limit the number of pixels that need to be lit. A lot of apps have started boasting darker schemes, and following popular demand, Microsoft is working on one for OneNote, which will be available across all platforms. </p>
<p> Wine has been giving users of Unix-like platforms access to Windows software for many, many years. The open source project just added support for Android back in 2018 with the v3.0 update and continued that with Wine v4.0 last year. Now, Wine v5.0 is available on multiple platforms including Android. </p>
<p> VPNs are rather popular with the security conscious, but it can be difficult to find trustworthy services since there are so many to choose from, and often, these services aren't very user-friendly. This is why AP is proud to present CyberGhost VPN. Not only does this particular VPN include access to fast and secure Android app, but you can also expect a quality desktop app that supports Windows, Mac, iOS, and Linux, and there are dedicated apps for smart TVs and routers as well. So if you've ever struggled with viewing streamable content while vacationing or traveling for work away from the US, and are looking for a secure VPN that will allow easy connections that unblock your favorite streaming sites when away from home, CyberGhost VPN is the solution you've been looking for. </p>

<p> Microsoft's 'Your Phone' app allows you to connect any Android phone to a Windows 10 PC, but some features require deeper system integration. If you have a Galaxy Note20, you can use your mobile apps from your Windows PC, and the same functionality will be available on the Surface Duo at launch. </p>
<p> If you have a phone paired to your Windows 10 machine with the Your Phone app, you'll be able to take advantage of a small improvement that may be useful to those of you who prefer listening to content on your Android device while you're working on the desktop. </p>
<p> Microsoft and Samsung partnered up to bring us an enhanced version of the Your Phone service that connects Android phones with Windows machines. The Korean company promised to add even more exclusive improvements to the syncing utility for the Galaxy S20 and the Z Flip, like cross-platform copy and pasting and RCS support. As part of the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Build announcement, the partners took the chance to make good of that word. </p>
<p> Microsoft bringing screen mirroring to Your Phone was a big deal since it was supposed to work irrespective of your phone or PC make, unlike some branded applications. Besides ironing out some bugs, the company now wants to make "Phone screen" compatible with more Windows 10 computers. But its approach pulled a classic one step forward, two steps back, as the feature has dropped support for all phones except for some newer Samsung models. </p>
<p> Microsoft's been toying with the idea of mirroring your phone's notifications (and more) to Windows 10 for quite a while. The feature was previously present for beta-testing folks running the so-called "insider" builds, and yesterday the company formally announced that notification mirroring has arrived for the rest of us — though reports indicate that the rollout is happening gradually. </p>
<p> As Samsung and Huawei attempt to re-engineer their foldable phones so that they don't break so easily once they limp to market, we're left with smartphones with tack-on screens, laptops, and convertible or so-called 2-in-1 tablets. Microsoft seems to have mastered the folding aspect of its hardware with its Surface lineup of PCs, but it may be stretching to produce a new "foldable" tablet that will run, of all things, Android apps. </p>
<p> Microsoft is bolstering its PC-to-phone bridging app, Your Phone, with the release of the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview — in fact, it's the bulk of the changes touted in this preview version. For build 18908 (20H1), fast ring insiders will be able to try out new accessibility tools and messaging features with more Android devices. Oh, and there's a new logo, too, but that's just the start of things. </p>
<p> It has always been the dream to reliably control one's smartphone from a computer — through syncing notifications, texting from the PC, and screen mirroring. Several apps have targetted different aspects of this — Microsoft's Your Phone being one of the more high-profile ones. With the recent v.3.8.4 update, the Your Phone app now supports MMS and using mobile data to sync notifications, photos, and messages. </p>
<p> Not too long ago, Microsoft announced phone screen mirroring between Windows 10 and Android. It's a neat feature, letting you effectively have your Android apps on your computer. It was previously limited to a handful of devices and select testers, but now the tech giant is opening it up to more devices. </p>
<p> Qualcomm has been building laptop processors for a while now, designed for always-on Windows 10 ultraportables. Now that an ARM version of Windows 10 is widely available and works with Snapdragon processors, the gates have opened for porting the operating system to smartphones. @NTAuthority on Twitter already demoed Windows 10 on a Pixel 3 XL, but now they have ported it to the OnePlus 6T. </p>
<p> In a series of tweets and replies, NTAuthority showed off the touchscreen working, with many applications (including Google Chrome) fully functional. The most impressive demo was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 running on the phone, using Windows' built-in x86 emulation compatibility layer. </p>

<p> Windows 10 Mobile </p>
<p> The Android army marches on, killing other operating systems left and right, leaving carcasses of once vibrant and flourishing platforms in its wake, dangling them more and more from the Gartner and IDC market share tables, until there's no place left for them but the ambiguous "Others" row. </p>
<p> The latest report is brutal for both BlackBerry OS and Windows Phone / Windows 10 Mobile / whatever Microsoft is calling its platform nowadays. It's the Q4 2016 report from Gartner and in it we learn that smartphone sales have grown 7% compared to Q3, that overall 2016 sales also increased a little, that Samsung lost its top spot as smartphone vendor for the first time in a while to Apple (likely thanks to the Note 7 kaboom), but most importantly, we also learn that Android still managed to grow its market share by 1% year-on-year, despite having crossed 80% worldwide. </p>

<p> windows 8 </p>
<p> ASUS re-announced at IFA today a slew of new devices, some of which aren't actually new. We first heard about the Transformer Book Trio back in June when ASUS Chairman Jonney Shih introduced just under a dozen products in under an hour. The Transformer Book Trio is billed as a"three-in-one" ultraportable, though there are only two pieces - a tablet and a keyboard dock. If you're familiar with the ASUS Transformer line of products, there is nothing new about this form-factor. </p>
<p> Dual OS devices featuring Windows 8 and Android are nothing new (if anything, they're becoming more and more common), and Samsung decided it was time to throw its name into the we can do two things at once arena with the just-announce Ativ Q. At its core, the Ativ Q is a 13.3-inch laptop/tablet hybrid, but the real allure here is its insane 275PPI display that runs at a massive 3200x1800 resolution. </p>
<p> Today at Computex 2013, ASUS' Chairman Jonney Shih gave birth to no less than 11 products in a span of less than an hour, a surprising rate of fire we're not used to even at flagship events like MWC or CES, let alone Computex. Not bad at all, ASUS. </p>
<p> Undoubtedly, the most interesting and important announcement was the Transformer Book Trio, "the world’s first three-in-one mobile device." The Trio actually consists of two pieces: </p>
<p> Hey, you got your Jellybean in my Windows 8! No, you got your Windows 8 in my Jellybean! The ASUS Transformer AiO probably isn't as tasty as Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, but it will have a slimming effect... On your wallet. You may remember this odd tablet-meets-PC from our previous coverage. In short, it's an 18.4" Android tablet that also plugs into a base unit running Windows 8. The screen can be toggled between the Android and Windows 8 modes when docked, and it includes SplashTop Remote Desktop for connecting to the base unit while roaming freely. </p>
<p> The first time I tried using ADB after updating my PCs to Windows was a very unpleasant experience. What worked so well on Windows 7 was apparently borked in Windows 8 thanks to the new driver verification system that disallows unsigned drivers from running without this mode being first disabled, which requires a reboot. Upon subsequent reboots, driver verification is re-enabled, making the entire process tedious and beyond frustrating. I've since resorted to using a portable version of Linux Mint install virtualized within Windows – a less than ideal setup, it is. </p>
<p> Back at Computex 2012 last year, ASUS showed off an 18" Windows 8 all-in-one desktop that could turn into a gigantic Android tablet simply by sliding the display out of the dock. Questions aside about whether anyone needs or wants an 18" Android tablet, the tech was certainly neat. This isn't a dual-boot situation, but rather two completely concurrent OSes being run on two separate systems in the same device. The whole of the hardware carries an Intel processor and NVIDIA SoC. </p>
<p> I want to ask everyone a question - well, everyone who owns an Android tablet, that is - how often do you instinctively reach for it, as opposed to your phone or laptop? I don't care what the reason is, I'm just genuinely curious how much of a "tweener" role your Android tablet has taken in your life. And after you read this editorial, share that story with me in the comments, because I'd really like to have a discussion with people on this. </p>
<p> Splashtop makes some great remote desktop software. I like Splashtop. So please friends, readers, and developers over at Splashtop, keep in mind my love for the company as a whole when I say the following sentence: Charging users $25 to try out Windows 8 on an Android tablet is an absurd, opportunistic, rip off of an idea. Most disappointingly, it will work for a small minority of users. And their money spends just the same as any other. </p>
<p> Last week, ASUS released a couple of videos teasing its announcements for Computex 2012. Given the contents of the videos, our first guess was that the company would be announcing a dual-boot Windows 8/Android tablet. And we were right... kind of. </p>
<p> It is a dual OS device - but it's not exactly dual-boot, nor is it exactly a tablet. It's an all-in-one 18.4" desktop that can seamlessly transition between Windows 8 and Android 4.0. </p>

<p> The Android army marches on, killing other operating systems left and right, leaving carcasses of once vibrant and flourishing platforms in its wake, dangling them more and more from the Gartner and IDC market share tables, until there's no place left for them but the ambiguous "Others" row. </p>
<p> The latest report is brutal for both BlackBerry OS and Windows Phone / Windows 10 Mobile / whatever Microsoft is calling its platform nowadays. It's the Q4 2016 report from Gartner and in it we learn that smartphone sales have grown 7% compared to Q3, that overall 2016 sales also increased a little, that Samsung lost its top spot as smartphone vendor for the first time in a while to Apple (likely thanks to the Note 7 kaboom), but most importantly, we also learn that Android still managed to grow its market share by 1% year-on-year, despite having crossed 80% worldwide. </p>
<p> Microsoft is getting ready for a big Windows 10 Mobile push after more than five years of toiling in vain on Windows Phone. In hopes of encouraging Android users to jump ship, Microsoft has released AppCompare, an app that tells you if the apps you have installed on your Android device are available on Windows Phone. If this sounds familiar, that's because Microsoft already tried this, and it didn't go well. </p>
<p> It might surprise you to learn that the Android Police staff does not work on a series of networked Chromebook Pixels connected to Google's sentient God-Cloud. Nope, most of us use Windows for daily posting and other general tech stuff. So it's awfully interesting that Microsoft is making a push to bring Android apps to its various Windows platforms starting with the upcoming Windows 10. At today's Build 2015 developer keynote, Microsoft said that devs will be able to "reuse nearly all the Java and C++ code from an Android phone app to create apps for phones running Windows 10.” </p>
<p> Huawei recently shared plans to release a dual-OS Android/Windows device in the US come Q2 of this year. Now, the company has publically stepped back from those words. It didn't provide an explanation, but it did emphasize its "open approach" towards mobile operating systems and a desire to provide "a range of choices for consumers." Most of the Huawei's handsets will continue to run Android, and while Windows Phone still isn't off the table completely, the two platforms won't play along anytime soon. </p>
<p> Huawei likes Windows Phone. However, it thinks the mobile OS would taste better when served alongside Android. That's why, despite expressing commitment to Microsoft's platform, the company reportedly plans to bring a dual-booting Android/Windows Phone handset to the US sometime this spring. </p>
<p> Here's Huawei Chief Marketing Officer Shao Yang, speaking with TrustedReviews: </p>
<p> “With Windows Phone, one direction for us – and one that we are now following – is dual OS. Dual OS as in Android and Windows together.” </p>
<p> He goes on to say: </p>
<p> “We think the dual OS can be a new choice for the consumer. It will be on sale in the US in Q2.” </p>
<p> Back many moons ago, HTC and Microsoft we're buddy-buddy. HTC was producing Windows Mobile devices, Microsoft was happy to be one of the leaders in the smartphone business, and everything chugged along nicely. Then the iPhone and Android showed up, changed the smartphone game completely, and Microsoft was essentially left in the dust. The company has since been trying to get back in the ring with Windows Phone, but high licensing costs and lack of third-party support make this an unappealing option to many hardware vendors – why pay for the OS (Windows Phone), when you can get one for free (Android)? </p>
<p> If you're a dedicated follower of tech news, you've probably heard the big story from late last night: Microsoft is buying Nokia. Holy cow, Redmond has an end-to-end distribution model! This could finally make Windows Phone a competitor! The phone and tablet market is getting its first major shakeup since the rise of Android! </p>
<p> Well, yes, and then again no. While it's true that the upcoming acquisition is a huge deal for Microsoft, and an even bigger deal for Nokia and anyone who's invested in the company (either in a monetary sense or as a customer), I can't see it having a huge impact on Android. </p>
<p> Changing ecosystems is hard. You have to download your apps all over again and if you're going to a platform that's not made by Google or Apple, you have to wonder whether or not you'll even have your apps available to you. Well, thankfully, Microsoft has stepped in to provide a tool for users to find out whether or not you'll be covered if you switch. I tried it out and guess what it found? 92% of the applications I use are available on Windows Phone! Except... </p>
<p> Yes, Microsoft insists that a full 92% of my apps are available on Windows Phone. </p>
<p> The Developer Economics 2013 report—a sort of State of the Union on app development—is out and it's packed with helpful tidbits, both for armchair analysts and programmers trying to make some sense out of this crazy software world. One of the most interesting observations the survey showed is there is still demand for a third platform. And right now they're getting it in a surprising place: on Blackberries. </p>
<p> Above is the graph of OSes that developers list as their "main" platform. That is not to say that any of them code exclusively for them, just that it is the primary target for attention. </p>
<p> Well, this sure came out of left field. Microsoft has released an official Xbox LIVE app for Android! The app can be used to view and modify your 3D Xbox avatar, track your achievements, connect with Xbox LIVE friends, and even get news and information from the Xbox Spotlight feeds. Color us surprised at how fully featured this app is. </p>
<p> The app has a distinctly Metro UI feel to it, which is unsurprising as Redmond has been keen to slather the vector-based UI on all of its properties these days, but the theme definitely clashes with Android. Functionally, however, it's very robust. </p>

<p> I want to ask everyone a question - well, everyone who owns an Android tablet, that is - how often do you instinctively reach for it, as opposed to your phone or laptop? I don't care what the reason is, I'm just genuinely curious how much of a "tweener" role your Android tablet has taken in your life. And after you read this editorial, share that story with me in the comments, because I'd really like to have a discussion with people on this. </p>
<p> In the increasingly crowded market for Twitter clients on Android, another big player is about to jump into the fray - Carbon. You may know Carbon from its days on WebOS, but now that HP's mobile operating system is little more than an open source zombie, Carbon's developers are looking for a new (and more profitable) home. </p>
<p> While the app is already available on Windows Phone 7, that version is styled quite differently from the upcoming Android version, shown in the video below. </p>
<p> It certainly seems like it. Yesterday, Microsoft announced via blog that it had concluded negotiations with Samsung and reached a licensing deal for the same seven patents it previously licensed to HTC for Android (along with other, smaller Android manufacturers). There were rumblings about just what royalty rate Samsung is paying, but the guess is anywhere from $5 to $15 per handset (it's likely on a percentage-of-MSRP basis - so think about 1-3% per $500 MSRP phone). </p>
<p> For every Windows Phone 7-inspired app, launcher, or theme we've written about, a half-dozen more, often clones, go unmentioned. But every now and then we find something we haven't seen before, and this is one of those times. It's called WP7Contacts, and as you would surmise, it's a contact manager inspired by Windows Phone 7. </p>
<p> Ah, Android hackers. Aren't they the best? They take our beloved operating system and install it on everything possible! Most recently, they have managed to evict Windows Phone 7 from the HD7 and replace it with the little green robot. Have a look at this hot video action: </p>
<p> Pretty slick, right? While I'm not sure that there is any practical reason behind doing this, it's always cool to see Andy kicking ass where he wasn't meant to be. </p>
<p> Are you one of the many that likes the look of Windows Phone 7, but doesn’t want to give up your existing launcher in lieu of a WP7 lookalike? If so, we have an app for you. It’s called Launcher Wall and feels similar to Windows Phone 7, without duplicating the interface. </p>
<p> Launcher Wall is an interactive live wallpaper comprised of customizable, animated tile-style icons with an animated background. It is pretty straightforward; each tile corresponds to a user defined app in which you can change the size, placement, angle, size, transparency, and animation. </p>
<p> It's official: Nokia and Microsoft have formed a strategic alliance. Which, in layman's terms, means Nokia smartphones will be powered by Windows Phone 7, and search across all Nokia devices will be powered by Bing. What does this mean for Android, though? </p>
<p> Well, who knows. On the one hand, this is a move by Nokia to try to stop hemorrhaging customers, especially from the highly profitable smartphone segment. </p>
<p> After many weeks of speculations, Nokia and Microsoft finally announced minutes ago that the 2 companies are entering a strategic partnership "to build a new global mobile ecosystem." </p>
<p> Nokia has been struggling to keep up with the exploding smartphone market in the past years, and it was clear that something needed to be done. </p>
<p> MeeGo, Nokia's latest bet at replacing its aging Symbian system with a new, open sourced, Linux-based OS, has been in development since 2010, but no phones running this OS have been released by the company yet. </p>

<p> windpad </p>
<p> It seems that a lot of Android tablet news is coming out of Computex already - we've already seen the Padfone and Eee Pad MeMO 3D from ASUS, the ViewPad 7x and 10Pro from ViewSonic, and now, the WIndPad 100A from MSI. </p>
<p> The 10.1 inch WindPad 100A sports a 1280x800 IPS display with an unnamed ARM Cortex A9 dual-core processer under the hood, but we're guessing it's most likely the Tegra 2. </p>
<p> MSI announced two new tablets at CES 2011: the Android-powered WindPad 100A and the Windows-operated WindPad 100W. </p>
<p> A few months ago, MSI demoed its WindPad 110 at Computex. The device sported a 10" capacitive touch screen and was powered by NVIDIA's Tegra 2 chip. Engadget's hands-on demonstrated a fairly unpolished interface that needed a lot of work. </p>
<p> The newly rechristened WindPad 100A is a slim 10.1" device weighing in at 1.6 pounds and packing: </p>
<p> An ARM Cortex A8 chip (from an undisclosed vendor) </p>
<p> 1GB of RAM </p>
<p> A digital compass </p>
<p> A GPS Locator </p>
<p> G-Sensor gravity detection (protects the internal hardware in case the unit is dropped) </p>
<p> ALS light sensor (adjusts screen brightness according to the surrounding light source) </p>
<p> WiFi with a 3G option </p>
<p> USB and HDMI slots </p>
<p> Front and rear cameras </p>
<p> MSI estimates that the WindPad's battery will last about 8-10 hours on a single charge. </p>
<p> There’s no doubt that 2010 is the year of the tablet, with manufacturers promptly following suit after the release of the iPad. With Computex getting into full swing, there’s no shortage of tablets on the showroom floor, with many of them running Android. </p>
<p> One such tablet is the MSI WindPad 110, which, according to Engadget, is running Android 2.1. Sporting a 10-inch touch screen interface, the WindPad 110 has a glossy, black exterior and is powered by NVIDIA’s Tegra 2 chip, as opposed to many tablets which are running Intel’s Atom processor. </p>

<p> wind-up knight </p>
<p> Wind-up Knight 2 first appeared in the Play Store last month, but it was geo-restricted to Canada to get the kinks worked out. Now it's ready for everyone else to take a look at. Just like the previous title, Wind-up Knight 2 is an action-platformer with style to spare. It offers in-app purchases, but does so in a pretty reasonable way. </p>
<p> The original Wind-Up Knight was an endearing little platfomer, and it's looking like the sequel is just as cute and includes some new gameplay mechanics. This game has launched in Canada first, with access expanding to other countries soon. Most of you will have to make do with the trailer for now. </p>
<p> Wind-Up Knight was one of the first truly great platformers on Android, and now developer Robot Invader is taking on puzzles with a new game called Rise of the Blobs. It's a little bit like a fusion of Tetris and Collapse, but with food. It is up to you to hold off the ever expanding army of blobs as they seek to (presumably) consume your marshmallow hero. I mean, you almost can't blame them – he looks so tasty. </p>
<p> Over on the AndroidDevelopers YouTube account, Google has produced a little video about the development of Wind-Up Knight. </p>
<p> It's a short interview with the founders of Robot Invader, the developer behind the game. They talk about what a good idea it was to develop for Android, and go over some of Android's advantages for developers. They reach 100 devices with a single binary, they can update builds in 24 hours, (*ahem* ..Apple) </p>
<p> Wind-Up Knight is a high-end 3D action game that will destroy you. That is the first sentence of the Market listing for the new game from development team Robot Invader. Pretty big words to live up to, don't you think? Whether it will actually destroy me or not will have to be seen, but, after watching the gameplay trailer, I can safely say that it looks awesome. </p>
<p> Impressive, no? It has more to offer than smooth side-scrolling graphics and a quirky-cute aesthetic appeal, too. </p>

<p> Windy Day </p>
<p> Google surprised everybody back in 2014 with an unusual project called Cardboard, a low cost and simple viewer that could work with a smartphone to create simple virtual reality environments. Cardboard has quickly grown into a very engaging tool and it has been adopted in many classrooms as a result. The latest update to the demo app polishes up the experience as well as makes it a bit easier to find new apps to play with. Sadly, Windy Day is no longer included. </p>
<p> What's New </p>
<p> Welcome Video </p>
<p> The first time you launch Cardboard after the update, you'll be greeted immediately by one of the big changes: a brand new welcome video. </p>
<p> Motorola's Spotlight Player, available only for the Moto X, serves you interactive films stuck somewhere between being as involving as a game and as passive as a movie. Motorola's first "Spotlight Story" came out late last year with the name Windy Day. The film, created by Ratatouille director Jan Pinkava, tasked players with moving their Moto Xs around to find items and trigger parts of the experience. Now another story is available by the name of Buggy Night (this time directed by animator Mark Oftedal), and it works much the same way. </p>

<p> At next week's Galaxy Unpacked 2020 event, Samsung is expected to take the wraps off a total of five devices, which includes its new flagship tablet range. The Galaxy Tab S7 for 2020 is rumored to be accompanied by a bigger Plus model, and we’ve already heard a lot about the two. But the latest WinFuture report gives away nearly everything about the two slates. What’s most surprising here is that Samsung looks set to downgrade the standard model’s screen by using LCD technology instead of keeping the AMOLED from last year. </p>
<p> We were pretty dang sure Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Beans Buds Live headphones were going to include active noise cancellation based on the details in a previously leaked video, but an update to the Samsung Galaxy Buds listing on Apple's App Store has the final proof positive we needed: A big, clear ANC toggle for the Galaxy Buds Live in the app's screenshots. New renders of the upcoming earbuds, including their charging case, have also leaked courtesy of WinFuture's Roland Quandt, who further provides battery life, specs, and prices for the bean-shaped buds. </p>
<p> Samsung is set to unveil the big-screen Note20 series at its Unpacked event early next month. But before that happens, leaks and rumors have already painted a pretty good picture of how the lineup will shape up. Just a day after detailing the top-tier Note20 Ultra model, WinFuture has now shared almost everything that there is to know about the standard Note20 — a stylus-clad flagship that will lack some of the bells and whistles of the Ultra. </p>
<p> Following all the previous rumors renders and confirmed specs for the Galaxy Z Flip have just been published, courtesy of @rquandt and WinFuture. This gives us the clearest glimpse of the upcoming folding phone that we've seen yet, showing off the phone's front design, hinge, tiny clamshell-mounted display, and side-mounted fingerprint sensor in surprising detail, and illuminating its interior with a full spec sheet. </p>
<p> Images of Google's upcoming Nest Mini, successor to the earlier Home Mini, have just leaked courtesy of the folks at WinFuture. Based on these images, you'd be forgiven for confusing the new speaker with the older model, since it basically looks the same, excluding a hole on the bottom for mounting it more easily on a wall. </p>
<p> Noted leaker Roland Quandt published a series of photos over at WinFuture today, showing off a refresh of the Huawei Watch GT — alleged to go by the immensely creative name "Huawei Watch GT 2." The design is strikingly reminiscent of the original, though it appears to have smaller bezels, a slightly bigger display, slimmer design, a larger battery, and both an integrated speaker and microphone. It also won't be running Android Wear, like the previous model. </p>
<p> More specs for Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Note10 have leaked. According to well-known leaker Ice universe, the Note10 will support charging at up to 25W, and the larger Note10+ will support up to 45W — though it will only come with a 25W charger in the box. WinFuture further believes that the Note10 will be using a Snapdragon 855 in the US, and not the upcoming Snapdragon 855 Plus. </p>
<p> According to a report by WinFuture, Qualcomm is planning another new chipset for Wear OS devices, even though the existing Wear 3100 has barely materialized in any devices. The upcoming silicon will feature 64-bit support, 12nm node, Cortex A53 CPU cores, and is alleged to go by one of two potential names: "Snapdragon Wear 429" or "Snapdragon Wear 2700". In short, it sounds like it might actually bring some decent performance to the platform. </p>
<p> We know a fair bit about Sony's plans for Mobile World Congress by now, including the launch of a new flagship in the shape of the Xperia XZ4 (which may end up being renamed for the 10th anniversary of the Xperia brand) and two mid-range phones. We've also been hearing about another budget model called the Xperia L3, which we're now seeing official renders for. </p>
<p> The latest leaks come in the form of a range of official-looking renders, likely intended for a stockist's website. </p>

<p> There isn't a dual-screen smartphone quite like the LG Wing and after weeks of build-up and anticipation, consumers will be able to put down money for this swivel-out, lit-up board-on-a-board starting this week at Verizon. And if the machinery alone isn't enough for you to make a pre-order, the carrier is dealing out some saccharides. </p>
<p> The LG Wing is the latest consumer handheld device to test the limits of people's wills to not go click-clack back and forth while flipping — or, in this case, swiveling — it open. With two screens, a pop-up camera, and a lot of screen real estate to go around, some will have questions about its durability and the company is trying to address them with performative CGI in a new video. </p>
<p> Following leak upon leak (and a pre-announcement), LG finally made one of its weirdest smartphones yet official during a live event. The LG Wing is a dual-screen handset with a swiveling mechanism — you can rotate its display by 90 degrees, revealing another smaller one underneath it. LG hopes that this unique form factor will help with multitasking, like when you're navigating in your car while listening to music or watching a video while chatting with friends. To make it even more unique, LG has also added a pop-up selfie cam. </p>

<p> We've already seen LG's different-for-the-sake-of-being-different Wing leaked in two videos, but LG has just published a video teaser for the highly unusual phone. It's slated to be unveiled September 14th. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/08/26 9:54am PDTon Aug 26, 2020 and last updated 2020/08/29 1:19pm PDTon Aug 29, 2020. </p>
<p> While much of the smartphone industry looks to folding screens for the future of handset design, LG sure seems to have different tastes. Though LG phones have long had secondary displays in some form, the last few have stepped that up with full-size Dual Screen accessories. Earlier this year we heard about a new effort that would try something else entirely — now a short video of this alleged LG Wing has surfaced, giving us a look at a rotating dual-screen phone that’s unlike anything else out there. </p>
<p> It's a concept that's been teased by megacorporations for years yet has only had meaningful progress in recent years: delivery by drone. For Google, Project Wing was conceived some 6 years ago as a way to shoot dog food from a local warehouse to your house. Today, the FAA announced that Wing, now the bona fide Alphabet company, has become the first drone delivery company to receive an Air Carrier Certification, meaning that it can now legally do business in the United States. </p>
<p> As part of Google's big 2015 reorganization, many of the divisions tucked away inside Google became their own companies under the Alphabet umbrella. For example, the Google X's self-driving car project became Waymo. Now, two more wacky former Google projects are getting the same opportunity. Project Wing and Loon are both becoming Alphabet businesses. </p>

<p> Wink sells smart home hubs that can connect to countless products, including thermostats, door locks, fans, and lights. The company's hubs were a popular option for enthusiasts until last month, when it switched to a subscription requirement for most functionality. On top of all that, Wink is now suffering an outage that has lasted nearly a day, and it seemingly has lost access to its primary wink.com domain. </p>
<p> Wink recently caused an uproar when it launched a mandatory subscription plan out of nowhere, hindering anyone unwilling to pay from controlling their smart home hubs after a meager 14-day heads-up. The troubled company since backtracked and gave an indefinite extension of its free service, but of course, the business still wants to tap into a recurring income stream. It has announced that the $4.99-a-month subscription will become mandatory starting July 27, though this time around, free users will be able to retain some extremely limited functionality — if you even want to call it that. </p>
<p> IFTTT is the cloud-based service that links together hundreds of smart home and web platforms, enabling you to automate tasks across ecosystems. The service regularly adds new connections and removes non-working ones, and this time around, IFTTT has done some (late) spring cleaning and added a few more connections. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/07 7:00am PDTon May 7, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/22 1:30am PDTon May 22, 2020. </p>
<p> Earlier this May, Wink announced out of the blue that it would charge customers $4.99 a month to continue using its services, or else their hardware would stop working. Following understandable customer backlash, the company first extended the cut-off deadline by a week, and has now indefinitely back-paddled, saying that it'll look for a new start date of the subscription. </p>
<p> One of the biggest trends in consumer technology over the last few years has been the rise of the smart home. The number of different device categories that now make up the 'Internet of Things' (IoT) has grown immensely, with connected appliances now found in many households across the US and beyond. </p>
<p> The smart home was once an expensive hobby for tech-fiends only but has now become an affordable aspiration for normal people. You can get started for less than $30 these days, with some lights or a smart switch that can connect to your Wi-Fi network and be controlled with your phone. </p>
<p> If you're looking for an easy way to get into home automation, then this deal alert may interest you. The Wink Hub 2 is currently on sale, dropping down to $69.17 on a few websites. That's about $30 off of the MSRP, which is pretty decent. </p>
<p> Wink is a well-known name when it comes to the smart home space, and in a blog post today the company announced support for a bunch of new products. It supports five new lighting solutions, seven new security products/sensors, and three motorized window solutions (fancy words for automated window blinds). Connecting all your smart home devices into one seamless solution has never been easier. </p>
<p> Wink is a name that's decently well-known in the smart home space. Previously owned by the ill-fated Quirky, the home automation company got pawned off to Flextronics. Now, Wink will be joining i.am+, the firm founded by entertainer will.i.am. The sum of the acquisition is unknown right now, however, i.am+'s PR has confirmed the purchase. </p>
<p> There are increasing numbers of people looking into smart home products and services, and Wink provides a pretty robust option for them. "Powerful, but fun and easy to use" was how we described the Wink Home Hub 2 in our review late last year. Since then, compatibility for a variety of products and services has been added, including control of lights and thermostats through Google Home. Now, Wink is introducing a new light bulb starter pack and two new automation features in the app. </p>
<p> We have an interesting deal for you today, courtesy of Wink and Amazon. You can get the Wink Hub 2 for $80, a savings of $20, if you order through Alexa. This sale is good starting today and goes through 9:00 AM PST next Wednesday (3/15). You will need Amazon Prime and an Alexa-enabled device to take advantage of this. To get going, just say "Alexa, order a Wink Hub." </p>

<p> Smart home gadgets can get pretty expensive, and some might be tempted to pick up their hardware in used condition to save a bit of dough. Unfortunately for them, Wirecutter recently discovered that used Nest cams could provide the original owner with limited access to the new owner's feed, though the issue has since been fixed by Google. </p>
<p> Getting into home automation and smart home appliances can be a very elitist and expensive endeavor. If you want to take things a little seriously, you need a central hub that talks to your different smart objects and sensors over Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Z-Wave, and more, then automates processes between them. You can use it to make the light turn on when you open a door, or the siren sound off when some motion is detected. Hub choices are varied, but the two that keep coming back again and again in the smart home conversation are Wink and Samsung's SmartThings, both with Android apps and Google Assistant/Home integration. </p>
<p> Following the recent onslaught of home security systems from Nest, SmartThings, and Ring, Wink is throwing its name into the game and announcing Wink Lookout. The Lookout kit will cost $199, which is more in line with Ring's pricing, but it doesn't ask for any monthly subscription fees. That's both a plus and a minus. </p>
<p> But before we get ahead of ourselves, let's look at the kit. It comes with the Wink Hub 2 ($99), two open/close door and window sensors ($29 each), one motion sensor with adjustable sensitivity ($39), and one siren and chime with a built-in ring of LED lights and 10 selectable sounds ($39). </p>

<p> Prime Day is underway at Amazon and there are great deals to be had on plenty of gadgets and accessories for the nerdiest of folks. We've already covered deals on phones/tablets/Chromebooks, but what if you're more interested in making your home a little smarter? Well, fret not, because I've scoured the discounts and used my search-fu skills to find the best deals for the smart home noobs and veterans alike, deals that are especially catered for you, the Android user. </p>
<p> But before I start with my list, let me remind you of the couple of deals we've already covered that are relevant in a smart home setting: the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot are at an all-time low of $90 and $35 ($90 and $15 off, respectively), and the NVIDIA Shield TV is $20 off (remember that it's still slated to get SmartThings Hub integration and the SPOT for a cheap add-on Google Home-like experience). </p>

<p> I bought an apartment in October. You can imagine the joy at the thought that it'd be my future family's home, terror at the sight of the mortgage value on the signed contract, and all the excitement about getting to set up a house from scratch. I could pick everything that I loved from design to materials to colors to organization, and yes, also automation. </p>
<p> I wanted lights that turn on when the doors open, A/C units that cool the place when I'm coming home and the outside heat is too much to bear, cameras that catch intruders the moment they are detected, a washing machine that notifies me when the load is done, colored lights that coordinate with whatever I'm watching on TV, blinds that open and close with the sunset and sunrise, and much more. </p>

<p> Wink Lookout </p>
<p> If you're interested in a new security kit for your home or a way to get started setting up a smart home, Wink has a nice offering that's pretty much foolproof for newbies. I reviewed the hub a while ago, and though I moved to SmartThings for its more advanced features, I can still recommend Wink because it makes the basics a lot easier than SmartThings. And Wink's new Lookout takes that one step further by providing sensors and a siren that are pre-paired with the included hub, requiring even less setup. The system may not be as sturdy as other home security offerings from Nest and SmartThings + ADT, but it costs much less and requires no monthly fees. </p>

<p> winners </p>
<p> In Late 2014, Google - along with Adidas, Polar, and Withings - opened a Google Fit developer challenge, hoping to get more apps into Google's burgeoning fitness ecosystem. </p>
<p> Today, the winners of that challenge have been announced. The twelve grand prize winners will get special promotion in the Play Store, greatly increasing their visibility to potential users. Additionally, winners (grand prize and runners up) will receive the X_CELL and SPEED_CELL from Adidas, an unspecified "new" Android Wear device, a Loop activity tracker from Polar, and a Smart Body Analyzer from Withings. </p>
<p> Last week, we took a look at the nominees for Ouya's 10-day developer competition, Create. Today, we have the winners! These game devs will receive some undisclosed amount of money (out of a pot of $45,000) and almost certainly end up on the launch version of the Ouya console. So, what are they? Well, let's break them down by category. </p>
<p> "Pop Your Eyes Out" Award: Pipnis </p>
<p> We covered this one in our roundup last week, though we're at a loss to explain how it didn't win the "Best Couch with Friends" Award. </p>
<p> Our inaugural Monthly Home Screen Challenge for the month of October was a great success. So much so that we decided to keep the challenge going, and we got some awesome submissions for November. As always, it was tricky picking a winner, and after much deliberation we finally settled on Hotmann, who came up with an interesting take on the periodic table. </p>
<p> Just like last month's challenge, we have taken the winning submission and broken it down into its basic components for your reading/designing pleasure. </p>
<p> There were a ton of excellent entries for our first Home Screen Challenge, and whittling down all the home screens was no easy task. That's why we've chosen two winners this month - Xal and Austin C, who each showed us their own twist on a visually stimulating, yet practical home screen layout. Our winners will be contacted shortly to claim their AP shirts. </p>
<p> As promised, we've prepared a full overview of each of our winning home screens, highlighting each of their elements so that you too can create a home screen design that is both beautiful and functional. </p>
<p> O'Reilly's Android Open conference, which is happening October 9-11, is our first real media sponsorship of an Android event (yay!), and as media partners, we were given 2 free tickets to the event, along with an exclusive 20% off code: AN11AP. </p>
<p> Since nothing would make us happier than giving away the 2 free tickets we've gotten (worth $1295 each) to the most deserving AP readers, I had Cameron immediately fire up the giveaway last week. </p>
<p> Wow, you guys sure like Android figurines - with almost 1,100 entries, the giveaway post is now our most commented post ever. After letting a whirlwind of randomness and chaos work its magic on the list of entries, I'm now ready to congratulate the following folks who will be getting a free figurine from VinylFigurines.com shipped to their doorsteps: </p>
<p> We've passed your emails to Omar from Vinyl Figurines, so you should be getting some info from him shortly. </p>
<p> Remember our Out of Milk giveaway? Come on, it was like, a few days ago. If you don't, we gave away 25 copies of the Pro version of this absolutely fantastic shopping and pantry organization app to the comments here and on Google+ that we enjoyed the most. Here they are. </p>
<p> When milk is what you need and shopping warnings were not heed Then You, my friend, are out of luck and in the doghouse surely stuck </p>
<p> You need to shop with care and plan your trip with flair </p>
<p> Can’t decipher illegible doodles will end you up buying noodles </p>
<p> Don’t bring home salami knowing everyone eats pastrami </p>
<p> And when all that’s needed is a bit of oats you better not come rolling home with goats </p>
<p> No listed item should be carelessly omitted or for sure you will be deemed nit-witted. </p>
<p> The WakeVoice license giveaway attracted over 600 entries, and after sorting through all of them and picking 20 at random, we're ready to congratulate the following folks and send them free licenses: </p>
<p> We've passed your emails along to WakeVoice, so you should be getting your codes shortly. </p>
<p> Last week, we took the wraps off a new accessory contest sponsored by Seidio, in which five lucky winners will be the recipients of a case and desktop charger of their choosing. </p>
<p> After reading through all 170+ entries - some funny, some tragic, some that make you feel awful for the story teller, and some that were just downright crazy, we've reached a decision on who the winners are. </p>
<p> So, without further ado, here they are (in no particular order): </p>
<p> The Winners </p>
<p> Ryan Duncan </p>
<p> First up is a tragic story of a love almost lost thanks to a dead battery, but fortunately, it has a happy ending. </p>
<p> You may not remember the contest we had last month for the JLabs J4M ruggedized headphones, but I suggest you check the review out - they're a pretty good set of very tough earbuds. We gave away three pairs of J4Ms, courtesy of JLab, as part of the review. And the winners are: </p>
<p> Jason Taylor, from Texas, who entered via Twitter. </p>
<p> Bruce Cheek of Illinois, who entered via Google+. </p>
<p> Keith McCrory of Ireland, who entered via Google+. </p>

<p> Earlier today, I reviewed the ZAGGkeys Flex Bluetooth keyboard, and loved it. It's a fantastic little keyboard - ultraportable, has incredibly battery life, and is a pleasure to type one. Not only that, but it can easily pair with your Android tablet or smartphone, as well as any iOS device that you may have. Say what you will about iOS, but the ability to have one keyboard that can pair with both Android and iOS is just awesome. </p>
<p> Temple Run could possibly be the most anticipated game to come to Android since... well, ever. We've seen fake after fake after fake hit the Android Market in an attempt to garner downloads from unsuspecting folks looking to grab this iOS hit, and the Temple Run team took to its Facebook page to warn users of these fakes and announce that a real version is on its way. Now, we finally have a release date for the real deal, and it's coming on March 27th. </p>
<p> If you're a fan of old school turn-based RPGs, then you're going to love the game Konami just dropped into the Android Market: a throwback to the days of 16-bit console gaming called Ash. </p>
<p> The game puts you in the crumbling Empire of Aghaus, and follows the story of a pair of mercenaries after a "routine contract takes an unexpected turn" and throws them into the middle of a war that "consumes the entire continent." </p>

<p> winter </p>
<p> In time for the holiday season, Google today announced that it's flipping on the Nest Hello winter ringtones. Just like during Halloween, you have a number of options to choose from in the Nest app to bring the festive spirit to everyone visiting your home. </p>
<p> You've decorated your house, you've put on a festive watch face, you can't help but see red and green Christmas stuff everywhere you go, so what about decorating your phone's messenger app? After all, this is probably the thing you look at most during the day, so adding some jolly good spirit would go a long way in making the holiday charm follow you all the time. Facebook agrees and so it has updated its Messenger application with lots of customization options and some end-of-year themed options. </p>
<p> Version 1.40 of YouTube Kids, Google's way of getting your children hooked on video clips from a young age, doesn't want any youngster missing out on what's going on outdoors. Encouraging them to look away from the screen would be too risky, so instead YouTube Kids now has a winter-themed homescreen. Look at the snow, and imagine the cold. </p>
<p> SwiftKey's latest update won't radically alter how you type in the days ahead, but it will do its best to remind you that, baby, it's cold outside. A new winter theme is available that coats your keys in blue and covers them with snow. A cold gust of wind follows your trail as you trace over the keyboard, and the letters show up as large snowflakes as you type. The keyboard's background itself also sports a frosty design. </p>
<p> If this theme is too cool for your tastes, don't worry, that's not all there is to this update. The installer has been tweaked and will now automatically download language packs. </p>
<p> The Motorola Droid 2 Global is really turning out to be the worst-kept secret since the Bay of Pigs invasion, isn't it? We've been hearing inklings of it since mid-September, including rumors that the CPU would be clocked at 1.2 GHz. </p>
<p> Now, Droid-Life's legion of tipsters have spotted two more official Verizon documents featuring the Droid 2 Global: a holiday ad featuring the D2G (above), and nothing other than a sheet listing the tech specs. </p>
<p> And quite a nicely-equipped phone it is. Think of it as a beefed up Droid 2, with an alternative color option: </p>
<p> 3.7" 854x480 screen </p>
<p> 5 MP camera with 2 LED flash </p>
<p> 8 GB ROM, 8 GB microSD included (16 GB total) </p>
<p> Seems a little weird to launch an upgraded product so soon after launching the original, but hey - I suppose they're trying to get a leg up on their competition. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/wipe/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17553491" filename="wipe">
<p> In our final Android 6.0 Compatibility Definition Document post, we'll be looking at a small[-ish] clause added in the security section of the CDD. Previously, Google had not actually defined any particularly specific requirements about factory resets for Android devices. While all devices have such a function, they may differ in their efficacy and level of security post-wipe. And while we don't have any reason to believe a particular manufacturer is not already meeting these new requirements (a point I will stress), it's good to see Google is at least laying down a clear mandate on this issue going forward. </p>
<p> Basically, it was possible, pre-Android 6.0, for a manufacturer to merely conduct a logical wipe when doing a factory reset of a device. </p>
<p> Just yesterday, Google posted to its Android blog about Android Device Manager – a tool that will help Android users keep their phones and data safe by offering location and remote wiping/locking features that third party solutions have until now been filling in for. </p>
<p> This morning, users started reporting that the service was rolling out to their devices already. Indeed, Android Device Manager is getting introduced by way of Google Play Services version 3.2.25, but it's not complete just yet. </p>
<p> For now, it seems ADM is limited to a checkbox in the Device Administrators menu. </p>
<p> Of course, we're digging in to the new Play Services apk. </p>
<p> While there is no shortage of security apps on the Play Store, aeGis one stands out a bit for a few reasons. For starters, it's dead simple to use. Set up a specific trigger phrase and you can text your phone to lock the display, remotely wipe, find the address of, or sound an alarm from your phone. There's no web interface, unfortunately, but this app trades the elaborate suite of services of something like Avast for simplicity. </p>
<p> What's even cooler is this app is entirely open source. Built by a member of the CyanogenMod team as a side project, the entire codebase is available on Github here. </p>
<p> Amazon has begun pushing a software update to Kindle Fire owners, updating the tablet's software to version 6.2. The online shopping giant kept quiet about just what the update included however. Given this (lack of) information, the real story here is that the update breaks root. Additionally, the Fire is configured to update automatically over WiFi, and there isn't an immediately apparent way to stop it. </p>
<p> There is a bright side, however. After your Fire updates, regaining root access is not only possible, but easy, using SuperOneClick. For instructions, head over to the discussion on XDA Forums. It's worth mentioning that the update may wipe the Android Market app and custom keyboards, along with your root privileges. </p>
<p> The ability to locate your expensive bundle of joy, when lost or worse, stolen, is priceless. And arguably more so, is the capability to prevent whoever is using it from accessing your personal data and photos while placing premium rate phone calls to xxx numbers in Eastern Europe. </p>
<p> It's peace of mind that even if your phone is truly gone for good, then the biggest expense you'll incur will be a new handset, and hell, the insurance that you are paying through the nose for, should cover that. </p>
<p> Good news for all you prepared individuals out there who are subscribed to Sprints TEP (Total Equipment Protection) plan: You now have access to a new app that adds a whole new level of useful to protecting your device through Asurion, the third party company that handles the insurance rigmarole for Sprint (and pretty much every other U.S. carrier, but they don't get an app). </p>
<p> The Sprint Total Equipment Protection App essentially mirrors the functionality of services like Lookout Mobile Security (but without the antivirus part): It can be used for locating your phone via GPS, helping to find it by sounding an alarm (even when on silent mode), backing up your contacts, remotely locking your device with a pin code, and remotely wiping the contacts. </p>
<p> Device updates that break root are fairly common - in fact, I'd go so far as to say that the majority of updates do so. What's a bit less common, though, is an update that resets your device because you're rooted. The device in question here is the NOOKcolor, and unfortunately it looks like that's exactly what's happening. </p>
<p> Before I dive into the details, I think it's important to note that I doubt that even as much as manufacturers and carriers dislike when people root their device, it's pretty far over the line for them to remotely wipe the devices of people who have done so. </p>
<p> With Android 2.3, users will have not only a slew of new features (I can't wait!), but also a fix to a security issue present in the previous versions of Android: TapJacking. TapJacking occurs when a malicious application displays a fake user interface that you can interact with, but actually secretly passes interaction events, such as finger taps, to a hidden user interface behind it. Using this technique, a devious developer could potentially trick a user into making purchases, clicking on ads, installing applications, or even wiping all of the data from the phone. All around, TapJacking is not good! </p>
<p> In previous versions of Android, an attacker was able to display the fake user interface by creating a customized notification (called a Toast) to obscure the real interface. </p>

<p> wipeout </p>
<p> On the surface, Table Top Racing looks like just another mobile racing game. The cars are simple, the graphics are charming, and nothing about the title suggests any semblance of depth. But hold on to your cereal, because the cars about to drift their away across your kitchen table are packing more horsepower than it seems. Table Top Racing comes to us from the creator of Wipeout (Nick Burcombe, now CEO of Playrise Digital), and while this release may not have that series' over-the-top futuristic spectacle, it has enough content to suggest it was made by someone who knows what they are doing. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got an interesting point-and-click adventure, a dual-stick MOBA game, a couple of puzzlers, and a free version of a AAA racer. </p>
<p> We had the promise of a WipEout-style game in the past, but that never seemed to materialize. As sad at that makes us all, we now have something that looks equally as good: Flashout 3D. At first blush, Flashout actually reminds me quite a bit of Riptide GP, as well as F-Zero, with the addition of weapons. Because blowing stuff up is fun. </p>
<p> The similarities really end there between those two, though. </p>
<p> Activision has invited players to "say Hello to the BIG BALLS" (emphasis not added, we promise) with Wipeout, the Pitfall maker's latest entry into the Play Store. </p>
<p> The game is based on ABC's television show of the same name, in which contestants (typically in colorful dress) haphazardly schlep through various obstacles including big balls, swinging platforms, "topple towers," and various rubberized battering instruments. Activision's game looks to bring that experience to your mobile device, giving you the fun of trying to avoid wipeouts, while also retaining the option to view them in super slow motion and snap screenshots. </p>
<p> GBikes by Unchained Developers is a futuristic racing game that recently hit the Android Market. It features fast-paced, high adrenaline gameplay, along with some pretty stunning graphics. In terms of relativity, think Wipeout. This game is dangerously similar to the entire Wipeout series, but fortunately it is well-made and worth playing. There is, however, definitely room for improvement. </p>
<p> Gameplay </p>
<p> If you're looking for deep gameplay, this game simply does not have it, but that really isn't what titles like these aim for. </p>

<p> OnePlus hyped the Nord up for a long time, so it's a good thing that the phone lives up to expectations. For £379, this is one hell of a phone, but those of us that don't live in European or Indian markets have been left out. We have some good news, though; according to OnePlus cofounder Carl Pei, a Nord phone of some sort will be coming stateside soon. </p>
<p> Chasing like counts on social media and seeking approval from your friends are known to have a toll on your mental health and self-esteem. Instagram took it upon itself to curb such prevailing behavioral ramifications when it began hiding likes from posts for some of its users earlier this year. This change is being tested in seven countries worldwide, and the US will join the list as soon as this week. </p>
<p> While OnePlus fans eagerly await the upcoming announcement for the company's next flagship, early takes continue to trickle out. On the heels of DisplayMate's "A+" grade for the 7 Pro's display, Wired was able to take a look at a pre-production unit's camera performance, revealing a 3x zoom camera. The publication tested the OnePlus 7 Pro's camera at a recent Baku F1 race in Azerbaijan, pulling a handful of (compressed and downscaled) samples. Let's take a look. </p>
<p> OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei recently confirmed that the company's forthcoming 6T won't have a headphone jack. It'll include an adapter in the box, but what kind of self-respecting company would OnePlus be if it didn't also sell you a solution? Enter the Type-C Bullets, a new pair of wired earbuds that'll plug right into the new phone's only remaining port. </p>
<p> It's tough to choose a good security camera nowadays. Hundreds of brands are releasing their own and almost all of them offer a similar featureset. What I look for, personally, is integration with other smart home systems — namely Google Home — and whether or not a monthly fee is required to get the basic features. For those two reasons, the Logi Circle 2 has been on my watchlist for a long time, and its temptation is getting harder to resist with these two discounts. </p>
<p> The Kindle Fire is just about ready to launch, and not since the launch of the Motorola XOOM has an Android tablet been so hotly anticipated. With a little help from the mainstream media, consequent consumer excitement, and - last but certainly not least - Amazon's front page (all things manufacturers like ASUS could only dream of), it has skyrocketed to the top of many tech enthusiasts' holiday shopping lists. And at $199, it won't break the bank, either; the only thing that could possibly hold it back now would be, well, an underwhelming user experience. So has Amazon ironed out the kinks? </p>

<p> wirefly </p>
<p> Perhaps you recall the abrupt closure of online phone dealer Wirefly a few months ago. Its parent company Simplexity LLC filed for bankruptcy, and is currently being chopped up and sold as part of debt reorganization. The Wirefly name and website have emerged from this under new ownership with a focus on comparing devices and plans to help you find the best deal. </p>
<p> Assuming you didn't need to actually touch a phone before buying it, Wirefly has long offered cheaper prices on new devices with US carriers. That may be in the past now – we've been getting reports that Wirefly (and parent company Simplexity) is shutting down and filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. If true, that's the end of the line for Wirefly. [Update: We were able to get in touch with Wirefly to confirm the closing. </p>
<p> You could take the view that Wirefly has a better deal here, at least if you're willing to wait. </p>
<p> Looking to get your hands on HTC's new super-sized One? Then Wirefly is happy to offer it at a discount, at least if your preferred carrier is Sprint. Right now the service and hardware reseller is selling the HTC One Max for $129.99 for new Sprint customers and $199.99 for returning customers who re-sign their contract. Not bad for a brand-new flagship. </p>
<p> Technically new customers are getting a $120 discount off of the $250 retail contract price, but Sprint offers a $100 discount for porting your number from another service, so the effective price change is twenty bucks. </p>
<p> Verizon just released its variant of the HTC One Max for a cool three-hundred dollar bill this morning, but Wirefly clearly thought that was just too much, so it knocked a full 50 percent off that. Yeah, you can get the One Max for $150. Of course, that requires a new two-year agreement, but it looks like it's working for both new contracts and upgrades. That's hard to beat. </p>
<p> At this point, we're thinking this could be an error on someone's part, because that's a hell of a deal on a brand-spankin'-new handset, especially one like the One Max. </p>
<p> Hey you. Yes, you, the bitter, angst-ridden Verizon customer who's upset that you've got a snowball's chance in Hell of getting the next Nexus machine on Big Red. Let me console you with deals on a pair of new flagship devices: one that's got pretty much the same guts as the upcoming Nexus, and one that has software that looks kinda like a Nexus. Sort of. If you squint a bit. </p>
<p> If you're dedicated to The Now Network and plan on renewing the two-year grip it has on your wallet with the Galaxy Note 3, you're in for a bit of a shocker: the on-contract price is $350. New customers can use the $100 port-in credit to get it for just $250. Ouch. </p>
<p> Thankfully, Wirefly is here to make the upgrade cost a little easier to swallow by knocking a fifty spot off of Sprint's offering, so you can nab this gargantuan for $300. </p>
<p> The LG G2 is available from plenty of carriers in the US right now, but Verizon customers have an opportunity to save some cash on LG's latest and greatest. The G2 is down to $149.99 through Wirefly, and you get an even better deal if you're porting in a number with a free $30 Visa gift card. </p>
<p> The LG G2 is packing a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB of RAM, and a super-thin 1920x1080 LCD screen. </p>
<p> Lately Sprint has done its best to become an attractive option for people who love flamboyant high-end phones. Shortly after revealing the Galaxy S4 in Purple Mirage, the company announced that it would be the exclusive carrier of the red HTC One. Tempted? Now's a good time to jump on either handset, as Wirefly has discounts on both. </p>
<p> The Red HTC One costs just $49.99 for new customers, and as a bonus, the $36 activation fee is waived. </p>
<p> You can't have them in your grubby little paws just yet, but as soon as the new Motorola DROID phones from Verizon are ready to ship, you can get them at a big discount from Wirefly. If you pre-order one of the devices now, you can save $50-100. </p>
<p> The DROID Ultra (red or black) is going for $149.99, which is $50 off Verizon's price. The Mini is also $50 off, at just $49.99. </p>

<p> Samsung's latest flagship – the Galaxy Note II – which we've so far only seen on video and in international markets, is finally (officially) headed to States-side carriers, with AT&T beginning pre-orders and Sprint and T-Mobile officially launching the device today. </p>
<p> In addition to official carrier launches (and the opening of pre-orders), though, Wirefly.com has opened up orders for the Galaxy Note II's T-Mobile variant, listing the flagship phablet at $279.99 for new or upgrading contracts. </p>
<p> The new myTouch 4G is around the corner, and today Wirefly was the first retailer on the web, from what I could tell, to launch preorders on 3 of the 4 color variants: black, white, and red. </p>
<p> The phone is available for $149.99 for new accounts and upgrades and $199.99 for family plans adding a new line. </p>
<p> As usual, Wirefly ships free (November 3rd) and doesn't charge tax in most states. </p>
<p> Wirefly, notorious for launching the best mobile deals on the web, did not disappoint us today, which, if you remember, is the official T-Mobile G2 launch date. </p>
<p> While the competition sells the G2 at $199.99 and even $149.99, Wirefly's $99.99 deal for new accounts completely knocks it out of the park. </p>
<p> Add free shipping and the absence of tax, and you get some serious savings left in your pocket. </p>

<p> While Stadia's launch last year arguably packed fewer features than we initially anticipated, Google is hard at work to add long-promised capabilities. This Tuesday, the company announced that it would roll out wireless Stadia controller support for laptops and desktops, and it looks like the capability is now already widely available. Just like always could on Chromecast, you can finally enjoy Stadia wirelessly on your computer using its first-party hardware. </p>
<p> Anker has been doing well for itself in the wireless earbud market, and Rita was impressed with its most recent products' quality and affordability. While she didn't review this particular model, thousands of others did, and the praise is almost unanimous, which makes this deal all the sweeter. The Soundcore Life P2 is on sale on Newegg for just $43 dollars this week, $17 off the standard price. </p>
<p> Apple popularized fully cordless audio with its AirPods, but other manufacturers also offer cheaper or better alternatives. A good illustration is Aukey's in-ear buds, which are much more discreet than their counterpart — meaning they don't look like toothbrush heads — and cost $100 less. The below coupons make them $20 cheaper and therefore one of the most affordable products in their category, at just $39.59. </p>
<p> Project Fi has made the leap that all fledgling Google projects aspire to - after around three-and-a-half years, it has dropped the "project" and evolved into "Google Fi," with a brand new logo to boot. Along with the name change, Google has announced that the wireless provider now supports "the majority of Android devices," including Samsung and OnePlus handsets, and iPhones (in beta). </p>
<p> It may not be perfect quite yet, but Samsung's DeX implementation for using your phone as a desktop computer actually works better than expected. In response to user requests, it seems the development team behind DeX is now working towards making DeX connections even more accessible by removing the need for a cable. </p>
<p> Verizon's done it. The carrier has launched its commercial 5G network, becoming a world leader in the next generation of wireless technology. Or so it says. The wireless operator (America's largest, by subscriber count) announced today that it is launching a 5G broadband internet service called "5G Home" in parts of Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and Sacramento — but its service is still quite limited, and it's not based on the formal global 5G standards. </p>
<p> At the start of the year, Harman announced a slew of new audio products from sub-brands JBL, AKG, and Harman Kardon. To us, the most interesting of those are the three that integrate the Google Assistant, and they're now available to pre-order on the JBL site. </p>
<p> It's a sad state of affairs, but smartphones nowadays are skipping the 3.5mm headset plug for valid, and sometimes not-so-valid, reasons. If your Android phone is following that trend, you have two solutions to listen to music: Bluetooth and USB-C. Today's deals on Libratone might help you save on both of these options. </p>
<p> Release after release, the Libratone name is becoming more familiar to me. While I raised my eyebrow the first time I heard Jeff mention it, I was quickly won over by its colorful and beautifully minimalist speakers. Over the past year, Libratone made more headway with us, Android fans, by releasing two products along with the Pixel 2: the Q Adapt USB-C in ear earphones (which Richard reviewed) and the Q Adapt Wireless on ear headphones. Then at CES 2018, Libratone followed up by announcing the TRACK+, a set of wireless in-ear noise cancelling earbuds. For $199, they had to stand up to the challenge of not only being good, but being near awesome to justify the price. </p>
<p> Bluetooth audio products take many forms at several price points, offering us the consumers multiple options to meet our respective needs. While some can go for the top-dollar, high-end items from Bose, others may need something under $100 or even $50. Affordable audio is potentially lucrative, especially when a customer can go find them at his or her nearest Walmart. Growing up, the only name of true note I knew in this particular market was Skullcandy, an edgy company set on providing decent-ish headphones and earphones that looked nice/cool, but didn't cost a whole ton. </p>

<p> wireless android auto </p>
<p> BMW was one of the last automakers to add Android Auto to its vehicles, and owners with compatible cars still have to go to the dealer to get the update. That's changing soon, though; BMW has just announced that an over-the-air update will start rolling out "over the coming weeks." </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/09/05 8:05am PDTon Sep 5, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/08 8:06am PDTon Sep 8, 2020. </p>
<p> While compatibility with wireless Android Auto is expanding on phones, there are still many in-car head units and media players that are stuck using tethered connections. That's where a device called 'AAWireless' comes in, which aims to add wireless support to as many Android Auto units as possible. </p>
<p> Android Auto has traditionally required connecting your phone to a car with a USB cable, but a wireless mode was introduced in 2018 for some Pixel phones. Samsung devices were later added to the compatibility list, and starting with Android 11, every Android phone that supports 5GHz Wi-Fi should be capable of running wireless Android Auto. </p>
<p> Some cars and head units are capable of displaying Android Auto from your phone wirelessly, but there are additional restrictions to the functionality — other than owning a compatible handset, you also need to live in one of the regions where the wireless connection is available. Luckily, the list of supported countries is expanding, and now you can use wireless Android Auto in almost all locations where the wired version is available, with only two exceptions: Japan and Russia. </p>
<p> Android Auto is handy to have in your car, but one of its main caveats is the requirement to have your phone plugged in at all times. Wireless Android Auto aims to solve that problem, and JVC and KENWOOD have collectively announced seven units that support it. KENWOOD's five units, all of which are understandably pretty pricey, are now shipping in the US. </p>
<p> We knew it was coming but it's now official: JVCKENWOOD has debuted 7 new car head units under its JVC and Kenwood brands with support for Wireless Android Auto. This means no more fussing with the USB cable and plugging your phone in every time you get in the car: the Auto interface will work wirelessly. This will be great for short trips, but you're still better off charging your phone during long drives, especially if you're using GPS for navigation, lest the battery die prematurely. </p>
<p> Android Auto makes the in-car experience a lot nicer (at least when it's not bugging out), but it's tedious to have to plug your phone in every time you get in the car just to use it. We've been hoping for a wireless solution for some time now, and it seems like it's finally becoming a reality. JVCKENWOOD will have two receivers capable of wireless Android Auto on display at CES 2018. </p>

<p> Alongside an impressive new series of phones, OnePlus also announced the second generation of its Bullets Wireless earbuds at today's launch event. The changes look minimal but we're told the earbuds have been completely redesigned with longer battery life, faster charging, and great sound in mind. </p>
<p> If you want exquisite-sounding music in your life, Sonos is one of the best options out there, especially when it comes to a hassle-free and reliable multi-room setup. The only problem is that the hardware is rather expensive. Thankfully, Black Friday is here and there are a few enticing Sonos offers. </p>
<p> Jaybird released its X4 earbuds not even two weeks ago, but the wireless headphone manufacturer is already back at it. Today, the company announced the Tarah, a new set of athletic earbuds set to retail at $99.99. They'll be available in three color combinations starting in October. </p>
<p> Qualcomm is looking to tackle some of the issues with Bluetooth audio with its new aptX Adaptive codec. Its key feature is that it dynamically adjusts to what you're consuming, which should not only improve audio quality overall, but also reduce latency in A/V content like videos and games. </p>
<p> Fitness-focused audio is a very saturated market, filled with options both good and bad. Wicked Audio, a manufacturer that focuses on providing good style and bang for your buck, recently sent me the Shred Wireless to try out. This pair of neckband earbuds packs quite a decent punch, especially for the price. The magnetic, metal housing on the buds themselves is nice, too. </p>
<p> Bluetooth headphones are everywhere these days. Most of them – many of which sit in the affordable range – provide passable, mediocre sound and varying degrees of battery life. Both are oftentimes better than the earphone counterparts, but it is difficult to get excited about these products in general anymore. The last time I enjoyed a pair of wireless headphones was when I reviewed the Phiaton BT 390, which continues to be one of my top recommendations for anyone needing something under $100, thanks to its impressive battery life and solid sound quality. </p>
<p> SōLIS is, in the grand scheme of things, a company new to the audio business. Centering around its oddly stylized name and its slogan "Leave no note unheard," SōLIS focuses on building hi-res audio products that do not necessarily break the bank. For some of us, that line sounds a bit familiar. The recent line of speakers, including these two, is aimed at wireless streaming aficionados. This market is currently dominated by Sonos and for good reason, but I like to see new players enter the field to test their hand. </p>
<p> International giveaways are popular here at Android Police, and today we've got an excellent one. We're teaming up with Jaybird to give away five of the company's X3 Bluetooth headphones. They're rugged, wireless, and sweatproof so they can handle whatever you toss at them. And five lucky readers, wherever they might be, will be able to grab a set for free. </p>
<p> We're giving you a chance to upgrade your audio game in one fell swoop. First, say goodbye to wires if you haven't already. Next, you get two wireless audio devices that aren't just wireless, but good in their own right. Even better is that if you aren't the giveaway type, we have a coupon to give you a $10 discount on the speaker and $8 off the headphones. </p>
<p> The UE Boom is an awesome Bluetooth speaker. It's got everything a great wireless speaker needs, loud and crisp 360 degree audio, a portable design, water resistance, thumpin' bass, and a crazy 15 hours of battery life. The only thing lacking is a great price to go along with all those features. Well, what do you know, it has a great price today too! It's just $99.99 on Amazon, half the normal price, which means this is a big BOOMIN' deal! </p>

<p> The Arlo Ultra is no longer the newest version out, with the Ultra 2 having debuted last month. That said, the Ultra 2 doesn't add much aside from better Wi-Fi connectivity, which means that you could save a whole lot without sacrificing much at all with the first-gen Ultra. The single-camera Ultra kit is down to just $290 at Amazon, representing a discount of $109.99 from its MSRP. </p>
<p> It's important to make sure your home is secure, but that can prove costly. Arlo is one of the better choices these days when it comes to wireless cameras, but its models often come in on the expensive side. We called the Arlo 2 Pro the best wireless camera you could buy back in 2018, and right now, Amazon has a two-camera kit with the Arlo 2 Pro on sale for just $199. </p>
<p> If you're looking for an affordable security camera that's packed with features, the EufyCam E is the one for you. It's got everything you need, and you can get it for just $110 today, thanks to the coupon code below. </p>
<p> If you're on the market for a wireless security camera system to keep an eye on your home and your yard without breaking the bank, the Anker eufyCam 2 is an excellent option. With this deal, you can snatch a two-camera bundle for $276, which is $76 off the regular price. </p>
<p> Having a baby can be stressful, and even though old-fashioned baby monitors let you hear your little one, they're not as reassuring as more modern solutions. Arlo's Baby Monitor, which allows you to see and talk to your baby in real-time, is down to $95, the lowest price it's ever been. </p>
<p> The wireless security camera market has become saturated over the past few years, but a new deal for one of Eufy's products should help it stand out from the crowd. Currently, the eufyCam 2C two camera kit is selling for $190 on Amazon with the use of a free coupon — $50 off its asking price. The add-on cameras are also being discounted by $15 and can be had for just $85. </p>
<p> Wireless security camera systems offering HD video often tend to be pricey, but they don't necessarily have to be. Thanks to this deal, you'll be able to secure your household without breaking the bank. Anker's eufyCam 2 two-camera bundle, which works both indoors and outdoors, is currently selling for $300, which is $50 less than usual. </p>
<p> Thanksgiving and Christmas are right around the corner, and some Black Friday markdowns are already starting to appear online. As part of Best Buy's promotions, Arlo Pro 2 bundles are up to $250 off, ranging from the simplest pack with a single camera, which is down to just $150, all the way up to the six-camera kit, selling for $250. </p>
<p> Arlo's wireless security systems have emerged as one of the more popular choices on the market, but their high price may have prevented many customers from giving them serious consideration. Starting today, Best Buy is offering a massive discount on the Arlo Pro 2 two-pack with Audio Doorbell, all for only $250, $200 less than usual. </p>
<p> Arlo makes some of the best security cameras on the markets. However, its products are also relatively pricey, especially when it comes to the Ultra models. However, thanks to this deal on a two-camera bundle, you can save $85 on the regular price and pay $515 for a complete system. </p>

<p> Wireless cameras </p>
<p> Arlo cameras are one of the most popular ones on the market, thanks to their advanced features, ease of use, and reliability. Sadly, they're far from being the cheapest, but this deal helps you get a bundle of Arlo Pro 3 cameras for up to $400 off. </p>
<p> Arlo cameras are amongst the most popular ones thanks to their reliability. Unfortunately, they're not cheap, but with this deal, you'll be able to get a two-camera kit for $427 on Amazon, which is 15% less than the MSRP. </p>
<p> Arlo cameras are popular on the market, mainly due to their reliability. They're also known to be relatively expensive, but this deal will help you save a few bucks on these multi-camera kits.

<p> wireless charger </p>
<p> Wireless charging is certainly handy, and it's also becoming more widespread. Heck, even OnePlus phones have wireless charging now. Right now, Amazon is offering up a selection of Anker charging solutions for up to 44% off as part of its Deal of the Day — including wireless chargers, wall chargers, and even a power strip. </p>
<p> Looking to pick up a sleek Qi wireless charging pad that can fill your phone up pretty fast? Aukey has one that can bring up to 15W to your phone (depending on model and wall charger) and it's on sale with promo code for more than half off! </p>
<p> Wireless chargers come in several shapes and sizes over the years, from stands to pucks and even orbs, but the mechanics behind how they work can make them kind of a pain. Positioning needs to be just so, or the coil on your gadget won't line up with the coil in the charger, and nothing happens. Multi-coil chargers have been a thing for a while, but the new Zens Liberty steps things up drastically, with sixteen coils stacked and staggered across its face. You can pretty much just dump your phone wherever, and it'll charge. It even looks pretty dang snazzy if you opt for the glass-topped version, but you'll pay €199.99 (around $215 right now) for that privilege. </p>
<p> If you've been spending more time at home lately, you may have started to notice gaps in your home charging setup. Whether you're perfecting your sourdough in the kitchen or improvising a new space to work from home, a well-placed wireless charger is a perfect way to ensure you'll always have a full battery. Right now, you can grab a two-pack of Anker's PowerWave wireless charging stands for only $25.49 at Amazon, saving yourself $7.50 off the MSRP. </p>
<p> After months of hype and more than a few leaks, OnePlus finally unveiled its latest smartphones at a live-streamed online-only event today. The OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro are the company’s most advanced ever phones, with the Pro model introducing a couple of long-awaited features in wireless charging and an IP rating. </p>
<p> Logitech probably isn't the first name that comes to mind when it comes to charging accessories, though the company has dabbled with wireless docks in the past. Today Logitech announced its new series of 'POWERED' charging accessories, but they're a bit pricey. </p>
<p> Do you happen to own a car without Android Auto support? Or maybe just a car without a great place to put your phone? Thankfully, there are plenty of third-party retailers ready to help solve that particular problem with a variety of mounts and cradles. If you happen to be looking for a new or upgraded phone holder for your car, you can save up to $14 on select phone mounts and home wireless chargers from iOttie during Amazon's latest deal of the day. </p>
<p> Wireless chargers are pretty great, especially when they don't cost a lot of money. Right now, you can get Anker's PowerWave wireless charging stand for just $11.99 from Newegg. That's $7 cheaper than the current Amazon price. </p>
<p> It's finally here! After all the speculation, photo leaks, and contradicting details surrounding its revolutionary camera system, the brand new Samsung Galaxy S20 series has arrived. To keep your new phone safe while also looking great, Spigen has a new case lineup for Samsung Galaxy S20, S20 Plus, and S20 Ultra, with styles ranging from a bold matte black, to simple and crystal clear, and even your favorites that pack the most protection. </p>
<p> Hey there! The dust hasn't even settled from the deals roundup we brought to you earlier this week, and we've already pulled together a fresh batch of goods that are ripe for the taking. Today, we're featuring discounts on Bose headphones, Amazon Echo Dot 3rd gen, additional Pixel 4 offers, and more. Check it out! </p>

<p> wireless charger duo </p>
<p> Wireless chargers are convenient in many ways: Not only do they spare you the need to attach a cable to your phone, they're also handy if you have multiple devices with different ports. Samsung's dual wireless chargers take this amenity to the next level, as they can charge two devices wirelessly at the same time using a single cable. You can snatch them at a discount, as the Qi Wireless Charger Duo and Wireless Charger Duo Pad, which features Fast Charge 2.0, are down to $50 and $70, respectively. </p>
<p> Samsung's latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy Note9, officially went on sale yesterday for a whopping $999.99 - or $1,249.99 for the 512GB model. We started seeing sales almost immediately when the similarly-priced Note8 was released, and now the first discount on a Note9 is here. The 128GB model is currently $929.99 on eBay, and you can get the Wireless Charger Duo for $20 off as well. </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event yesterday primarily focused on the Galaxy Note9 and Galaxy Watch. If you're planning on picking up both of those, the previously-leaked Wireless Charger Duo is now available from Samsung, but you'll have to cough up $119.99 for one, which is quite a bit more than expected. </p>

<p> Maybe you've had your eyes out for a Galaxy S20 phone and you just can't wait another 3 months for depreciation discounts to start setting in. I mean, you could totally grab an S10 for cheap, but perhaps you'd also rather not much longer wait to own a 5G phone. Well, Amazon will try and make it worthwhile by bundling in wireless earbuds and a wireless charging pad free with your pre-order of an S20, S20+, or S20 Ultra. </p>

<p> wireless chargers </p>
<p> Been up to some spring cleaning? That means you have room for new stuff! We have a handful of great deals for you to check out this fine Monday: a sizeable discount on Sony's best ANC headphones, some cheap chargers, and a great pair of spare earbuds to keep in your gym bag. </p>
<p> Hey there! The dust hasn't even settled from the deals roundup we brought to you earlier this week, and we've already pulled together a fresh batch of goods that are ripe for the taking. Today, we're featuring discounts on Bose headphones, Amazon Echo Dot 3rd gen, additional Pixel 4 offers, and more. Check it out! </p>
<p> Afternoon, readers! As we barrel headlong toward Black Friday madness, let's all pause to appreciate the deals we have today. This week, you'll find a repeat of the best deal we've ever seen on Google's Nest Hub, plus a great price on a 60-watt USB-C charger, among other smartphone accessory savings. </p>
<p> In the market for a new charger with enough oomph to power your laptop? Anker's got you covered. The PowerPort Atom III can push up to 60 watts, just one watt shy of Apple's standard MacBook Pro charger. At a sale price of $28, though, it costs less than half as much. </p>
<p> Welcome to the last week of summer! As you mourn the decline of daylight hours, console yourself with some deals. This week, we've got a great price on Amazon's new Echo Show 5, plus money off the Anker Nebula Capsule, a cool wireless charger, and more. </p>
<p> Accessories makers tend to come onto Amazon with their Deals of the Day as if it were a carousel. This day, it's Aukey's turn and we're tracking a dozen products on sale for at least 20% off. From keyboards to Bluetooth earbuds to speakers and chargers (a load of chargers), we've got them parsed down for your participation and consumption. You just need to act before midnight PDT tonight. </p>
<p> When it comes to wireless chargers, the biggest drawback of most of them is they make it hard to see or use your phone while it charges. Chargers that mount your phone in a way that faces you tend to have various mechanisms that add extra steps to putting the phone on or taking the phone off of the charger. Scosche's MagicMount Pro Charge, however, gives you a top notch wireless charger that places your phone in perfect view and without any cumbersome gadgets to keep it in place. </p>
<p> Even better, 14 AP readers will get one free thanks to Scosche. </p>
<p> If you bought your wireless charging pad a couple years ago, you're probably due for an upgrade. And if you don't have one — assuming your phone supports wireless charging — it's time to treat yourself. Even if you already have a supported charger, chances are there's another place where you'd like to have one. No matter your setup, you'll want to get in on this giveaway where 30 AP readers will get one for free. </p>

<p> wireless charging </p>
<p> Fast charging has been one of the key battlegrounds in the smartphone wars in recent years, and Xiaomi has often been at the forefront. Last year, the Chinese OEM announced that it was working on a 100W wired charger that could fully fill a 4,000mAh battery in just 17 minutes. It's now going one step further with 80W Mi Wireless Charging that takes almost as little time to do the same job sans wires. </p>
<p> Many newer cars have wireless charging built in, and pretty much every car nowadays has Bluetooth audio. But for those of us with older cars without those niceties, the iOttie wireless car charger, now discounted by $15 to $39.99 on Amazon, is one of the only ways to play audio and charge at the same time. </p>
<p> Wireless charging is certainly handy, and it's also becoming more widespread. Heck, even OnePlus phones have wireless charging now. Right now, Amazon is offering up a selection of Anker charging solutions for up to 44% off as part of its Deal of the Day — including wireless chargers, wall chargers, and even a power strip. </p>
<p> Leaks regarding the Pixel 5 were prolific in the lead-up to today's announcement, but two specific details left folks in the know confused: How could Google's phone sport a metal body and have wireless charging? Usually, you can't have both. Either a phone has a metal back, and you give the feature up, or another material is used that won't interfere with it — hence the rise of glass-backed smartphones. Well, the solution is pretty simple: Technically, the phone doesn't have both a metal back and wireless charging. </p>
<p> There is never a good time for a charger or cable to go bust, missing, or pilfered, but if you're looking for some replacements at the moment, then today is the day to get them from Anker — the power peripherals maker has a number of Deals of the Day on Amazon today. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/08/16 6:30am PDTon Aug 16, 2020 and last updated 2020/08/22 1:46pm PDTon Aug 22, 2020. </p>
<p> The Pixel 4a is an incredible phone, and not just for the money. With an incredible camera, a new design that feels much more modern, and amazing battery life, Google really did knock it out of the park with its new budget Pixel. Seriously: this is a damn good phone. But we wouldn't be proper phone nerds if we didn't nitpick, and there are a few areas where we think Google could take the Pixel 4a from a 9.5 to a perfect 10 in our book. Here are five additional features we'd have loved to see in the Pixel 4a. </p>
<p> Oppo promised a delivery of massive power yesterday. Today, it brings on the surge with the announcement of four charging products: a 50W wall charger based on its SuperVOOC standard, a conceptual 65W AirVOOC wireless pad, a 110W mini flash charger, and a 125W full-size flash charger. </p>
<p> The Fire HD 8 is one of Amazon's most popular hardware products, but it has been overdue for a hardware refresh. Now the company has finally released a new version of the Fire HD 8, and there are even some features you don't normally see in a tablet — like Qi wireless charging. </p>
<p> Wireless charging is great, but the large coils that are required for the Qi standard can take up a lot of space inside smaller electronics and increase costs. That's why products like smartwatches, fitness bands, wireless earbuds, and so on typically only support wired charging. However, there might be a new easier way to include wireless charging on low-power devices: NFC. </p>

<p> wireless charging pad </p>
<p> Hey there! The dust hasn't even settled from the deals roundup we brought to you earlier this week, and we've already pulled together a fresh batch of goods that are ripe for the taking. Today, we're featuring discounts on Bose headphones, Amazon Echo Dot 3rd gen, additional Pixel 4 offers, and more. Check it out! </p>
<p> Whether you're tired of fumbling with wires to charge your favorite smartphone, or you've already converted to wireless power and you're in need of more charging pads, you're going to want to take a look at this affordable option from Anker. Available now through the end of this month, Amazon Prime members can snatch up an Anker PowerPort Wireless 5 Pad for just $7.99 ($10 off) with promo code. </p>
<p> This isn't a drill. Christmas is only five days away, and you're in need of some last-minute stocking stuffers to round out your holiday haul. It just so happens that the Anker PowerWave Pad wireless charging system has just dropped to an all-time low of only $9.59 ($2.40) on Amazon. If you order it now, it can even arrive before Christmas day. </p>
<p> Mobile accessory maker (and maker of other things like mini projectors) Anker has a boatload of products on sale right now on Amazon and its flash deal site, Woot. You can save a whole bunch on car chargers, wireless chargers, Bluetooth speakers, AA batteries, and so much more. But where should you go to save the most? </p>
<p> It's the week before Thanksgiving and you're probably about to head off to the relatives or to a friend's apartment to share in a meal, some laughs, and maybe a good dose of anxiety. One source of anxiety you'd want to nip right from the bud is power sourcing — you've got gadgets, after all. Fortunately, Anker has a few good deals running today only on Amazon to satisfy your needs. </p>
<p> If you are looking for a reliable way to wirelessly charge your phone or keep some extra juice tucked away in a pocket when away from home, then look no further than BESTEK's Wireless Charging Pad and Power Bank. Not only does this combination of products ensure that you'll never have to worry about your phone running out of power at home or on the go, but you can snag them both from BESTEK Mall for 60% off their retail price while supplies last. </p>
<p> The era of ubiquitous wireless charging isn't quite upon us. With metal bodies blocking the connection and fast charging reducing how much time we spend tethered to a wall, most of us don't expect to see all that many people (even those with high-end devices) dropping their phones on pads </p>
<p> This isn't really so much news as "I thought this was kind of cool and wanted to share it with all of you." I just received an evaluation unit of Samsung's new wireless fast charge pad for the Galaxy S6 edge+ and Note 5, and upon opening I noticed immediately that it was quite a bit thicker than Samsung's old Galaxy S6 wireless charging pad. I then spied an array of what looked like (and as it turns out, are) ventilation openings all along the bottom of the charging puck. Could it be? Did Samsung build a phone charger with a fan inside it? </p>

<p> OnePlus released its first pair of wireless earbuds this summer. Normally retailing for $79, we found that they offer surprisingly good sound for the price. Now the buds are slipping into impulse buy territory with savings of $20 from Amazon and other online retailers, making them a mere $59. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/10/15 8:00am PDTon Oct 15, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/20 8:47am PDTon Oct 20, 2020. </p>
<p> These days, there is a plethora of wireless earbuds on the market, but EarFun has developed a reputation for building enticing audio gear at affordable prices. The same is true for its latest buds, the EarFun Air Pro. They're among the first sub-$100 wireless earbuds that feature hybrid ANC thanks to EarFun's innovative QuietSmart technology, which helps reduce ambient noise by up to 38dB. EarFun has teamed up with us to give away seven units to seven lucky Android Police readers. </p>
<p> Aukey has a solid reputation for making affordable accessories you can rely on. Today, Amazon is offering up to 58% off select Aukey audio products including Bluetooth 5.0 wireless earbuds, FM transmitters for vehicles, and Bluetooth audio receivers that pair with existing audio system setups. </p>
<p> True wireless buds with high-quality audio usually cost more than $100, but thanks to this deal, you can get the Jabra Elite 65t for just $81.68, which combine a fully cordless connection with great audio quality. </p>
<p> The Jabra Elite 65t feature Bluetooth 5.0, five hours of battery life with ten more thanks to the charging case, and IP56 sweat and dust resistance, meaning these buds will have your back even during your intense workouts. They're also compatible with Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri, making sure you can talk to your favorite voice assistant without taking your phone out of your pocket. </p>
<p> Sadly, only the the Titanium Black model is currently marked down, with the Gold Beige selling for $100. </p>
<p> Bluetooth earbuds are quick and convenient to use, and as wireless audio products grow in popularity, higher-quality options get cheaper. Right now you can snag a pair of Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 earbuds for just $69.99 — a full $30 off from Amazon and Best Buy. </p>
<p> Wireless earbuds are all the rage these days. Devialet, a manufacturer based in France, is best known for making high-end speakers, and now it's taking its expertise in audio and translating that to a smaller form factor. The company's new Gemini wireless earbuds might be more expensive than other alternatives, but they offer up a lot in exchange. </p>
<p> Even though true wireless buds are the trend, some people prefer neckband or corded ones, mostly because they can be kept around your neck without risking to lose them. Aukey's B60 are a great option if you prefer this form-factor. They usually cost $40, but they're currently down to just $15 thanks to a $25 coupon. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/06/25 11:30am PDTon Jun 25, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/27 7:55am PDTon Sep 27, 2020. </p>
<p> Wireless headphones are becoming a necessity these days with more and more devices removing their headphone jacks. Jaybird has some solid options, but they're usually pretty expensive. The Tarah is one of its lower-priced offerings, and now they're even cheaper thanks to a substantial discount from Best Buy. </p>
<p> Mobvoi is known on the market for its affordable smartwatches and buds. After releasing the second generation TicPods 2 Pro in January, the brand just announced an updated model that comes with a few additional features, especially independent pairing that now lets you use whichever bud you want without its counterpart. </p>
<p> Those in the market for true wireless earbuds have plenty of offerings to choose from, but if you're looking to stand out, there's probably no better option than the Klipsch T5. It helps that these have amazing sound quality and battery life, too. Launched at $199 last year, the T5 has since dropped to a going price of around $100. This $78.99 price, however, is the best we've seen yet. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/07/15 6:58am PDTon Jul 15, 2020 and last updated 2020/08/06 12:09am PDTon Aug 6, 2020. </p>
<p> Last month, Xiaomi took the stage in an online-only event to show off a slew of products, including its Redmi 9 phone series and its new true wireless earbuds. Among them was also the hotly anticipated and often-leaked Mi TV Stick, which the company has now finally released in India, where it will become available for purchase starting August 7. </p>
<p> There's a lot of hype around the AirPods, but if you're the kind of person that isn't into sticking toothbrush heads into their ear, there are more discreet options on the market. One of them is the Anker's Soundcore Liberty Neo, which is more compact, but also a lot more affordable, especially now that they're down to $45. </p>
<p> True wireless earbuds are increasingly popular today, especially after Apple released their AirPods. Nevertheless, traditional Bluetooth earphones are still very convenient, especially if you work out in a gym and don't risk them getting caught into something while you run. Thanks to this offer, you'll be able to pay almost half the MSRP for these Aukey B80 earphones, bringing them down to just $44. </p>
<p> The fine folks over at 9to5Google are reporting that the Pixel Buds have gained a feature that allows for spoken notifications to be toggled on or off on a per-app basis. Spoken notifications could already be broadly enabled or disabled, but previously, it'd been a one-size-fits-all situation. </p>
<p> Fitness-focused audio is a very saturated market, filled with options both good and bad. Wicked Audio, a manufacturer that focuses on providing good style and bang for your buck, recently sent me the Shred Wireless to try out. This pair of neckband earbuds packs quite a decent punch, especially for the price. The magnetic, metal housing on the buds themselves is nice, too. </p>
<p> You may have read the name Libratone a couple of times before on Android Police. The company specializes in minimalistic but superb audio products, like the One Click speaker that Jeff reviewed, and has recently been part of the Made for Google program with its Q Adapt in-ear (wired) and on-ear, the latter of which are even Google-certified with that Fast Pair capability. The company is back with another new product, this time a wireless in-ear earphone called the TRACK+. </p>
<p> The Jaybird X2 Bluetooth earphones are a great piece of kit. I don't know this firsthand. Artem loves them, I know that. And when they drop below $130 dollars, well, Jeff considers that dang near impulse buy territory. The two of us have different gauges for how cheap a pair of earphones needs to be to qualify as an impulse buy, but in case you agree with Jeff, the Jaybird X2 has again dipped in price on Amazon. </p>

<p> wireless fast charger </p>
<p> Wireless chargers use a big coil to create the field that actually charges your device, which is why placing your phone in just the right spot is usually necessary. Some chargers use multiple coils to increase the working area of the charger, but the new Zens Liberty sports a ridiculous 16-coil configuration that can charge up to two devices at once in any position, with up to 15W of output each. The company is even taking that level of overkill just a little bit further by offering a special edition model with a glass top so you can see all 16 coils. </p>
<p> If you missed out on the last short-lived Samsung wireless charger sale, today's deal might have been worth the wait. Right now Samsung is selling its first party "Slim" wireless charging pad for a mere $15. That's a $20 discount and less than half the original $35 asking price. </p>
<p> One of the perks of owning a Galaxy S or Note phone — apart from the tremendous accessory support, MST payments, display quality, etc. — is the convenience of wireless fast charging, topping up your phone quickly and easily without having to deal with fiddly, tangled cables or ports. But those fast wireless chargers can be on the expensive side, so saving a bit of extra cash can be swell. Thankfully, for the next eight hours or so, Samsung's last-gen Fast Wireless Charging Stand (and included AFC wall charger) is just $24 over on Amazon as a Deal of the Day. </p>
<p> Pre-Black Friday sales continue to trickle out a full week ahead of the day itself, and Samsung is the latest to publish its own preview for upcoming discounts. The variety covers everything from wearables to TVs and even smart home gadgets(and we're happy to tell you about them, too), but the promotions that have us most excited are for the company's latest Note and Galaxy-series phones. Starting on the 18th you can get a Note 9 for $800 unlocked, and a Galaxy S9 and S9+ for $520 and $640, respectively. </p>
<p> There are a lot of Samsung-branded wireless chargers out there. Our own Artem even discovered that some of the cheaper options sold by 3rd parties are often fakes. So if you see dubiously inexpensive convertible charging stands out there, you might want to think twice. Thankfully the folks at B&H and Amazon have tossed theirs on sale for as little as $49.99, a savings of $40 over the standard price. Now deal-seekers need not fret about authenticity. </p>

<p> Getting a premium audio experience doesn't have to come at a premium price. If you're hoping to walk away from Prime Day with a fresh new pair of Bluetooth over-the-ear headphones, look no further than these deals from our friends at Cowin. </p>
<p> A lot of wireless headphones have been released over the last half-decade, but few have earned reputations as good as the QuietComfort models from Bose. If you've been eying a pair for yourself, but not quite ready to pull the trigger, Prime Day might finally push you over the edge. The Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II wireless noise-cancelling headphones are available for just $199, the lowest this model has ever been. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/06/25 11:30am PDTon Jun 25, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/27 7:55am PDTon Sep 27, 2020. </p>
<p> Wireless headphones are becoming a necessity these days with more and more devices removing their headphone jacks. Jaybird has some solid options, but they're usually pretty expensive. The Tarah is one of its lower-priced offerings, and now they're even cheaper thanks to a substantial discount from Best Buy. </p>
<p> OnePlus has always been known for providing a lot of bang for your buck. Its recent devices may cost more than the original OnePlus One did, but they're also a lot more powerful. We called the OnePlus 8 Pro "the most phone you can get for the price," and its little sibling didn't fare too badly, either. Now the company is looking to offer up even more value with new deals every Wednesday in an effort called OnePlus Day. </p>
<p> Noise-canceling headphones are gaining in popularity during lockdown, as they isolate from unwanted noise and help remain focused on work. Sadly, many of these cost at least $150, which can be too steep for most people, especially if they seldom need to use them. Thankfully, Anker's Soundcore Life 2 headphones are currently available for just $40, making them very affordable and a smart purchase given the current context. </p>
<p> There are plenty of options to choose from when it comes to the ANC headphones category. Even though Bose and Sony offer the most popular products, luxury brand Montblanc just unveiled a new piece of tech that's about $200 more expensive than its counterparts. At this price, it offers premium built quality and Google Fast Pair, which set it apart from the competition. </p>
<p> Hey there! The dust hasn't even settled from the deals roundup we brought to you earlier this week, and we've already pulled together a fresh batch of goods that are ripe for the taking. Today, we're featuring discounts on Bose headphones, Amazon Echo Dot 3rd gen, additional Pixel 4 offers, and more. Check it out! </p>
<p> There are plenty of wireless headphones on the market today, but with mid-tier options quickly gaining ground on the premium market, you no longer have to blow out your wallet to get a fantastic audio experience. For instance, you can pick up these Hi-res-certified Anker Soundcore Life Q10 Bluetooth headphones for only $29.99 ($10 off) on Amazon. </p>
<p> CES has already brought us a slew of new headphones and earbuds, but it doesn't sound like the wave of audio tech is over anytime soon. Sennheiser has joined in and introduced two new pairs of Bluetooth headphones during the show, the HD 350BT and the active-noise cancelling HD 450BT. </p>
<p> When you think of owning a pair of noise-cancelling headphones, big brand names with $300+ price tags probably come to mind. Luckily, you don't have to pay these tolls to get a great audio experience. Case in point: You can pick up a pair of Anker Soundcore Life Q20 wireless active noise-cancelling headphones for as low as $39.99 ($20 off) on Amazon. </p>

<p> The cellular network business is one of the most competitive in the world, but it's also one of the most lucrative, and it's only growing. That being the case, it's not surprising that American telecom giant Comcast may be looking into entering this hotly-contested market. According to a report on The Information, Comcast is hoping to use its huge userbase of home Internet customers to create a combination Wi-Fi and cellular network, competing directly with carriers like AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile. </p>
<p> If there is one thing we all eventually rely on with mobile devices, it's having a sturdy Wi-Fi connection. Whether it's because of a low data cap, you live or work somewhere with a weak cell signal, or like me, the local cellular technology is stuck in the stone age, you probably have a few wireless networks saved on your phone or tablet. While you probably take it for granted that your devices will automatically connect to these networks when they are in range, some people are finding that feature hasn't been working as expected since upgrading to Android 4.3. </p>
<p> Surfing the web while on the move has become a reality thanks to mobile internet over 3G or LTE. However despite yearly advancements in its technology, the reliability of mobile networks remains lackluster. </p>
<p> A solution to ubiquitous connectivity has come in the form of blanketing various cities with wireless hotspots. For example, in Singapore the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) have initiated the [email protected] program which aims to provide wireless hotspots all across the island. </p>
<p> Although it wasn't announced alongside the plethora of other features during the Ice Cream Sandwich event, Wi-Fi Direct may prove to be one of the more important and revolutionary features of the new OS. In the old days Bluetooth was the standard method of device to device data transfer, but now with Ice Cream Sandwich we are given Wi-Fi Direct and Android Beam. The latter uses NFC to transfer links, media, and other data, while the former is an interesting implementation of the wireless standard which creates ad-hoc networks between compatible devices. </p>

<p> Can't go clubbing 'cause of Coronavirus? Then you might as well have a dance party at home. Right now, Amazon is offering customers savings of up to 31% off Anker Bluetooth speakers — including the super slick Soundcore Wakey with an LED display and a built-in Qi wireless charging pad. </p>
<p> Now that phone bezels are shrinking and decent front-firing speakers have all but gone away, Bluetooth speakers are more important than ever. JBL makes some good options, including the Charge 4, which is going for $180 new on Amazon right now. Today only though, you can grab a factory reconditioned unit from Woot for just about $90. </p>
<p> It can be difficult to get premium sound without paying a premium price — if you're not shelling out the big bucks, things can sound tinny and thin. If you're on the hunt for a great speaker at a great price, you're in luck: Logitech's Ultimate Ears BLAST is on sale at Amazon for $60 ($20 off). </p>
<p> Sometimes, the best places to sit back and kick up the music are also a bit perilous for fragile electronics. Whether you're heading to the beach, hiking a nearby trail, or taking a float trip downstream, you're going to need a rugged Bluetooth speaker that can withstand the journey ahead. The Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2 for just $69.99 ($30 off) on Amazon and other retailers was built to endure all of these challenging environments and more. </p>
<p> The Altec Lansing Mini Bluetooth Speaker was already a bonafide steal with its rugged looks and ultra-affordable price tag of just $30. On this Cyber Monday, you can snag this mini wireless speaker for the cost of two cups of overpriced coffee. That's right, this baby can be yours for just $11.99 (60% off) right now on Amazon. </p>
<p> If you're in need of premium audio gear without the premium prices, you've landed on the right article. All throughout this Black Friday weekend, Harman is running exclusive deals on a ton of its most popular products, like wireless headphones, Bluetooth speakers, sound bars, and much more. Here are just some of the highlights you'll want to check out: </p>
<p> If you're in the market for an affordable Bluetooth speaker that can produce great audio, the JBL Flip 4 is an excellent choice. It usually sells for $100, but it's dropped to just $60 for Black Friday. </p>
<p> If you're looking for a powerful and waterproof Bluetooth speaker, JBL's Boombox is probably a good option for you. Many retailers are now selling it for $350, which is $150 less than its original retail price, even though it's been going for about $450 recently. </p>
<p> Marshall speakers are extremely popular, mainly thanks to their retro looks and impressive audio quality. Unfortunately, they're also known for their particularly high price, which can be a roadblock for some, especially considering there are cheaper options on the market. Thankfully, the Stanmore II Bluetooth speaker just dropped to $200, which is $150 off the MSRP, making it a much more relevant contender. </p>
<p> Whether you're looking for a power bank, new wireless speakers, true wireless headphones, or a projector, Anker's range of products is known to be reliable and affordable. Thanks to a special deal on the company's lineup, you can save up to $175 on a bunch of products today on Amazon. </p>

<p> Bluetooth audio products like portable speakers and earbuds are available from an ever-growing number of manufacturers, and this has made them, on average, more affordable than ever before. While DOSS may not be a household name, the company has a wide variety of portable Bluetooth speakers that don't skimp when it comes to specs and features. Today only, the company has a selection of portable speakers and a set of its truly wireless earbuds marked down by as much $25 during Amazon's latest Deal of the Day sale. </p>
<p> Although we're now weeks beyond Black Friday, the holiday shopping season is still very much in full swing, and there are plenty of great deals to be had. To prove it, Anker has unleashed a swath of discounts on its Soundcore Bluetooth speakers, wireless headphones, and more for up to 45% off via Amazon. You'll have to act fast, though, because these deals are only available until the end of the day. </p>

<p> A Google Home is far from your only choice if you want a speaker with Assistant support. Tons of companies are making them now — including Riva Audio, whose Arena and Festival speakers are currently on sale for $100 and $200 off, respectively. </p>
<p> In advance of IFA, Samsung is promoting a new set of wireless speakers they will show off there. Adding to their product lineup called Wireless Audio 360, this might signal a bit more seriousness on Samsung's part in terms of competing in the consumer speaker market. The R1, R3, and R5 join the R6 and R7, which were announced last year and look like eggs. </p>
<p> Samsung boasts about the design that blasts sound out in every direction, which addresses a fairly common shortcoming for consumer speakers. Unlike the previous generation's models, these will have some physical controls atop each device so you don't need to have access to the source to make adjustments. </p>

<p> Miro is an open-sourced, free solution to your media problems with Android. It's touted as an all-in-one solution, and with its feature list, I'm not about to disagree. It offers a media player, BitTorrent client, video encoder, music store and device sync component all wrapped up in a single program, which covers some of the problems Android has run into without its own downloadable client. </p>
<p> With your phone connected to your computer, you can use Miro to sync music and video to your phone. </p>
<p> If you're like me, you've been longing for cable-free syncing ever since you got your Android phone. Well, the wait has now ended, thanks to doubleTwist, otherwise known as the iTunes of Android devices. </p>
<p> Their latest update includes a handy new feature called AirSync, which does exactly what its name implies: it syncs your music, videos, and photos over the air. The desktop client and the regular Android app (both of which you'll need for AirSync to work) are still 100% free, but the AirSync feature itself will cost you $4.99 (on sale for $0.99 until 10,000 people download it). </p>

<p> wireless tether </p>
<p> Almost one full year ago, carriers threw the gauntlet down on tethering applications in the Play Store. Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile were among the first to lay down the banhammer, with Sprint following soon after. </p>
<p> Here we are, a year later and guess what? Version 3 of the infamous Wi-Fi Tether for Root Users app just hit the Play Store, sans carrier restrictions. Of course, this is only because carriers haven't yet found out about the app; when they do, however, you better believe its availability will quickly be laid to rest - so you better grab before it's gone. </p>
<p> A few months ago AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon all started blocking wireless tethering apps in the Android Market, making them unavailable for download on their respective devices. At that time, Sprint was the only carrier still allowing tethering apps to be installed without limitation -- but that time has come to an end. That's right, the Now Network has begun blocking the installation of wireless tethering apps from the Market on any device attached to its network. </p>
<p> It's a sad, sad day when we can't use the data that we pay for in a manner that we choose - but that day has arrived. It seems that somebody (perhaps carriers?) is blocking the ability to install Wireless Tether in the Android Market. This is what you get if you try to install it: </p>
<p> You can see that while it's still in the Market, it's not available for installation on any carrier-connected device. </p>

<p> Everyone has been making a big deal about NFC lately - which phones have it, where it can be used, etc. Until last night's announcement, many (including myself) didn't see much on the horizon except a fun way to pay for things using your phone. That perception has changed, however, thanks to Android Beam. </p>
<p> Beam utilizes NFC technology to quickly, seamlessly transfer data from one device to another. As demonstrated last night, one has only to touch the two devices together to send just about anything from web pages, to photos, to apps. </p>
<p> This tutorial will show you how to access your phone’s storage for transfers to and fro over your local WiFi network. We will install FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server software on the phone then mount it as a network drive on a Windows PC. Your phone and PC must be connected to the same network. </p>
<p> 1. Install SwiFTP </p>
<p> SwiFTP can be downloaded freely from the market. It is a small application which allows your phone to act as an FTP server. </p>

<p> If you're in the market for a new smartphone, Verizon's pixel-packing Droid DNA is hard to beat. It offers a whopping 440PPI in its 5" 1920x1080 display, along with a quad-core Qualcomm S4 Pro and 2GB of RAM under the hood. Top all that off with Android 4.1.1, and you have an absolute monster of a phone. </p>
<p> But if you want to get all that and save a bit of cash, Wirefly has your number So long as you're willing to sign a new two-year agreement with Verizon right now, you can grab the DNA for $50. </p>
<p> So, you want to jump over to Sprint, but don't need the fastest device on the planet? Both Amazon Wireless and Wirefly have a good deal going on the just released EVO Design 4G by HTC: $50. Update: It's still $50 at Wirefly, but Amazon Wireless just dropped the price to $30. Of course, this requires a new two-year contract, so all current Sprintsters will be stuck paying $80, which still saves about $20 over the in-store price. </p>

<p> As Sprint's newest dual-core WiMax device, there was the little doubt that Motorola Photon 4G would inevitably be compared to the HTC EVO 3D. The battle nearly started itself in the comments yesterday once our Photon 4G Review Roundup went live, as the EVO 3D loyalists came running to defend their beloved device. Fortunately, Bob Kovacs of Wirefly took it upon himself to find out which device is better by throwing them both in the ring together to face off in the Schmackdown. </p>
<p> Update 6/8/11: If you're set to only order from Amazon for some reason, their EVO 3D pre-order page just went up as well with the same price. </p>
<p> The official launch date and price for the HTC EVO 3D was just announced this morning, but Wirefly already has a pre-order deal of its own going on. Right now, you can ensure that you'll have this device ready and waiting for you on launch day for $180 with a two-year agreement, which is about $20 less then you'll be paying at Sprint. </p>

<p> Email remains the linchpin of online communication, and while we heavily rely on everything from instant messaging to video chat in order to stay in touch with the people we need to in our lives, we always find ourselves turning back to tried-and-true email. Of course, even for something so utilitarian as email, there are still a million companies putting their own spin on it, and for so many Android users around the globe, Gmail is their email service of choice. </p>
<p> A new app update means a new APK Teardown here at AP. Today's victim is the Google Play Store, which was just freshly updated to 3.9.16. We've got all sorts of stuff to talk about. </p>
<p> A Built-In Malware Scanner </p>
<p> Yes, it's hard to believe, but Google is working on a malware scanner for the Play Store. The string file doesn't lie: </p>
<p> <string name="package_malware_title">App Check</string> <string name="package_malware_consent_text">"Allow Google to check all apps installed to this device for harmful behavior? To learn more, go to Settings > Security."</string> <string name="package_malware_banner_warning">Installing this app may harm your device</string> <string name="package_malware_banner_blocked">Installation has been blocked</string> <string name="package_malware_recommendation_warning">Google recommends that you do not install this app.</string> </p>
<p> A new Google Play Store v3.8.15 apk started rolling out to Android devices today, but upon running through its UI, I was unable to uncover anything different from the versions before that. Yet the apk size gained a few pounds kilobytes, and not knowing what the 300KB of code and resources added was killing me. Not to worry, a few minutes later, I decoded both 3.7.15 and 3.8.15 and compared their contents. </p>
<p> Play Store Gift Cards </p>
<p> What I found inarguably points to Google gearing up to finally release redeemable Play Store gift cards - something we've been anxiously waiting for since the Android Market started supporting paid apps. </p>

<p> Google TV is the biggest change to Android TV we've seen in years, and although it may well have its drawbacks, it sounds like it's pretty good at serving you the content you actually want. It also has an easily accessible watchlist that you can add movies and shows from various services. We now know that this list is also integrated with the watchlist feature in Google Search, as well as the wishlist in the Play Store. </p>
<p> Stadia has, even its most ardent supporters will tell you, a games problem. It launched with just a handful of titles, and there's been a drip feed of additional releases ever since. Google has pledged to bring more than 120 titles to the platform in 2020, and while a few have been announced, we still have no idea what most of those games are going to be. So here, we've gathered 15 of the games we'd like most like to see on Stadia this year and beyond. </p>
<p> Last year's Android 10 was a massive release. It had a system-wide dark theme, updated navigation gestures, dozens of privacy changes, and much more. However, stock Android still has a few missing features compared to the customized Android builds found on devices from third-party manufacturers, and there's even a few iOS features that would be nice to see. </p>
<p> The first preview builds of Android 11 will likely show up in the coming months, no doubt with even more features to make our smartphones and tablets more useful. Here are 11 changes we'd love to see added to Android 11, in no particular order. </p>
<p> Stadia launched in what what most would consider a very unfinished state, missing many plenty of the announced features like family sharing and broadcasting, or with very rushed and incomplete features like screenshots or a game store. Shopping for games initially required the smartphone app, but the store launched on the web last week, opening the door to a more convenient shopping experience. It also reveals a bit more about some of the marketing and categorization we'll see as the Stadia catalog fills out. </p>
<p> On any given day, there are at least a dozen variations of the Play Store interface showing up for users across the world. Even on the same device, with the same account, and without any update, the Store might flip from one look to the other in a few seconds without warning. Most recently, simultaneous downloads showed up, but today we're talking about a more minor change, but one that's neat nonetheless: a more reachable wishlist button. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 6 is, without much question in my mind, one of the best phones of this year. On paper, it matches most of 2018's flagships, but the aggressive pricing makes it a great value when compared to most of its competition. Still, there are a lot of ways that the OnePlus 6 could be improved if the company sticks to its mid-generation "T" refresh, and I've put together a decent-sized list of all the things I'd like to see in the OnePlus 6T. </p>
<p> If there's one Amazon/eBay feature I've searched for and hoped for in the last few years, it's a collaborative wishlist. Ever since I met my now-husband and we started planning a life together, we've had issues keeping a single list of items we're considering purchasing. Both Amazon and eBay let us share our lists, but by "share," they simply mean let the other person view it. Adding items, editing them, removing things, that was all too much to ask for, unless we were using a Wedding registry on Amazon. </p>
<p> The Discogs app landed on the Play Store in 2016. Version 2.0, out now, features a number of improvements, including the new ability to explore the Discogs Database without starting at a specific search and better VinylHub integration that lets you view participating retailers' record selections from in the app. </p>
<p> With the recent announcement of a Red Alert game coming to Android in China, I started thinking about what other classic properties have yet to find a home on Android. Now, I know we have gotten plenty of garbage that uses the branding of popular classics for a quick buck, but that's not what I'm talking about. I mean more ports or HD remakes that stay true to their original roots and pricing models. So I have put together a wishlist of the top titles I would love to see brought to Android with the love and attention they deserve. </p>
<p> Update Wednesday held at least one more treat this week - a bump to Google Play Movies & TV, bringing the app up to version 3.2.25. Google hasn't published an official change log yet, but so far the only user-facing change we've found is the presence of applicable wishlist content (from your Play Store wishlist) inside the app, both on the "Watch Now" screen, and in the slide-out navigation bar. </p>

<p> Samsung's NYC event may have been rescheduled for August 30th, but that doesn't mean you'll have to wait till Tuesday to see the US versions of the Galaxy S II. We've already gotten a sneak peek at the visages of AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint's editions of the phone, and now (once again courtesy of Pocketnow) another press shot has been leaked: </p>
<p> This is, of course, the Epic Touch 4G - Sprint's version of the device. </p>
<p> The all-around awesome Galaxy S II has made debut all over the world to the tune of major success, but nary a peep (aside from the occasional rumor) has been heard about any versions of the phone bound for the US. Today, however, we have a new detail in the form of two blurry shots of the Sprint variant (dubbed the Within), and... well, let's just say anyone who's seen pictures of the GSII before knows what to expect, because not a lot is different here. </p>
<p> Pocketnow, via a wireless accessories website, has apparently discovered the names of 3 of the carrier-branded versions of the Galaxy S II that will be coming stateside later this year. The device will be known as the Attain on AT&T, the Function on Verizon Wireless, and the Within on Sprint. </p>
<p> Mysteriously absent is a T-Mobile version, suggesting either that the device won't be coming to America's pinkest carrier, or that it will be arriving in a different (QWERTY?) </p>

<p> ScanWatch is the latest in a range of hybrid smartwatches from French health and fitness company Withings. First announced at CES back in January, ScanWatch is finally going on sale after some pandemic-induced delays. It's now received the CE marking in Europe that clinically validates the detection of atrial fibrillation (Afib) and overnight breathing disturbances. FDA approval and a US launch are expected later this year. </p>
<p> Withings gained popularity thanks to its health-focused products, including its smart scale, fitness trackers, and hybrid smartwatches. The company is innovating once again with the announcement of its ScanWatch, the first hybrid smartwatch to combine AFib and sleep apnea detection. </p>
<p> Withings, previously Nokia (and even previously Withings), has updated its Health Mate app with some much-requested features. These include support for Dark Mode, sleep sync to Google Fit, and Strava integration. </p>
<p> Some people see smartwatches as gadgets and prefer to wear an old-fashioned style timepiece. Hybrid watches offer a good compromise between looking traditional with just the right amount of technology in them to keep track of your activity and wellbeing. The Withings Nokia Steel does that perfectly, as it looks just like a regular wristwatch, but has an extra dial to indicate how much of your daily fitness goals you've achieved. </p>
<p> Happy Monday, loyal readers. Before becoming enthralled in Google I/O 2019 tomorrow, why not check out a few non-Google deals? Today, you'll find 40 percent off the newest Echo Dot, plus savings on the 4K Roku Premiere, the stylish Withings Steel HR Sport, and then some. </p>
<p> We didn't have one of these lists to share on Monday — it was a slow weekend — but we're back with all manner of tech deals. Today we've got crazy cheap smart TVs, Sennheiser earbuds, a Bluetooth bathroom scale, and then some. </p>
<p> Withings, the French fitness company that was acquired by Nokia in 2016 and then sold back to Withings co-founder Éric Carreel the following year, has launched three new products at CES: the Move ECG, a fitness watch with an built-in ECG, the Withings Move, a basic analog fitness watch, and the BPM Core, a standalone health monitor. </p>
<p> Withings has been busy since it was acquired back from Nokia by its co-founder this spring. Not only did it launch the Steel HR Sport hybrid smartwatch in September, it has now unveiled an updated version of its very first activity tracker from 2013, the Pulse. The new Pulse HR is a minimal fitness tracker with a price tag designed to match at $130, roughly $70 less than the Steel HR Sport. </p>
<p> The first product to be released since all of that is the Steel HR Sport, another hybrid smartwatch with a small OLED display that can show your phone notifications, fitness data, and alarm settings, but this time it has more advanced activity tracking features. </p>
<p> We've gone full circle. In April of 2016, Nokia announced its interest to purchase french health-focused company, Withings. The acquisition and transition took full effect in June of 2017 when Withings became Nokia Health and all of its smartwatches and consumer-oriented health products were rebranded under the Nokia name. Fast forward less than a year and Nokia no longer saw value in this Digital Health Division and put it under strategic review. Now the circle has closed and Nokia has announced that it's doing exclusive negotiations to sell this division back to Éric Carreel, co-founder and former chairman of Withings. </p>

<p> withings body cardio </p>
<p> When I reviewed the Withings Body Cardio scale just this past Saturday, I came away impressed by most things it could do, but rather let down by its price. At $179.95, I didn't think there were enough reasons to get the Body Cardio instead of the regular Body scale, which cost $129.95. I found the heart rate monitoring rather pointless while standing up and the Pulse Wave Velocity measure an interesting feature but with limited usefulness and accuracy. </p>
<p> My last sentences of the post were, and I quote, "Withings smart scales do drop their prices sometimes, so if you happen to find the Body Cardio around the same price as the regular Body, go for it. </p>
<p> My arsenal of smart health and activity trackers has been missing a body composition weight scale. The Fitbit Aria always looked appealing to me because I've been wearing a Fitbit for more than 3 years, but it's getting a little outdated. Several months ago, I was looking at the Polar Balance Scale, the Withings WS-50, the Garmin Index Smart Scale, and a few others. Eventually, I settled on the QardioBase because I already had a good experience with the QardioArm and liked the company's no-nonsense approach to design and health. However, I was unlucky enough to get the first generation, which turned out to be a complete failure from the get-go. </p>

<p> Smart bulbs can be divided into two main categories: the ones that connect to your router using Wi-Fi, or those that require an intermediary bridge. Others also use Bluetooth, but they're usually less convenient, as they're not directly connected to the Internet. With the acquisition of WiZ, Signify, the company behind Philips Hue lights, has taken a smart approach, as it's present in the three aforementioned categories. With this in mind, it's just announced a new remote control and a motion sensor for its Wi-Fi lights, following in Hue's footsteps. </p>
<p> Back in June, Philips introduced a new range of bulbs that worked without the need for a hub. Although these connect to your phone directly through Bluetooth, they lack direct Internet access if you don't buy the Hue bridge. The company is looking at fixing this drawback with the release of a new lineup that operates directly over Wi-Fi and forgoes the need for a hub. </p>

<p> Google began rolling out a new version of the Photos app this afternoon. It's not a particularly feature rich update, it appears to include just a convenient shortcut for notification channels and a promotion for free shipping on photo books. However, a teardown does add a bit more meat to this release as it foretells of some basic integration with Google Maps and some helpful wizards for building quality photo books. </p>
<p> Though we just finished up our rumor recap for pre-I/O leaks and rumors, we've received information regarding Google's plans for the Play Store suggesting that Google may be building cross-device app restoration into the store's Android app. </p>
<p> Information is sparse so far, but from what's available to us, it appears that Google may be working on new functionality to restore apps and "data" to a new device, based on the data accrued on another device. Right now, the initial setup process for an Android device includes a "backup & restore" option that, try as it might, remains vague on exactly what the user will get. </p>

<p> You may have heard of WolframAlpha: an app (and website) which lets anyone compute and work with all sorts of data. It's actually used by Apple's Siri for looking up lots of information (when it can't find anything relevant on Bing), and it can be extremely useful for math homework, sports trivia, or all sorts of other random stuff. What you might not know is that the Wolfram engine is also used for serious computational work: it is used by many physicists and mathematicians for demanding simulations, symbolic calculations, and even some pretty animations. </p>
<p> Despite being more suited for theoretical work, it is also possible to use Wolfram's programming language for professional software development. </p>
<p> Could it be? Is Amazon offering another useful app that I actually want to own for the 2nd day in a row? That's pretty much a first so far, with the Shazam Encore/SwiftKey tag team being a close second. What makes today's deal especially valuable is that there is no free version of Wolfram Alpha at all, so combined with 4.7 stars and over 1,800 reviews in the official Market, getting today's free app right away is pretty much a no-brainer. </p>
<p> When Wolfram Alpha was introduced back in 2009, it sent shockwaves through the Internet and the scientific community due to its incredible artificial intelligence and instant usefulness in myriads of both highly scientific and day-to-day computations. </p>
<p> Recently, Wolfram Alpha LLC dropped the official WolframAlpha app into the market. It is one of my favorite services and I purchased it ($1.99) as soon as it came out. For those not familiar, this is a clip from the "about" page of WolframAlpha to give you some idea of what this is all about: </p>
<p> Wolfram|Alpha's long-term goal is to make all systematic knowledge immediately computable and accessible to everyone. We aim to collect and curate all objective data; implement every known model, method, and algorithm; and make it possible to compute whatever can be computed about anything. Our goal is to build on the achievements of science and other systematizations of knowledge to provide a single source that can be relied on by everyone for definitive answers to factual queries. </p>

<p> Technology is supposed to make life easier, but that's not always the case. For women living in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, smartphones have made it harder to escape from abusive families and a social system that restricts their choices. Now, activists including Human Rights Watch are calling on Google and Apple to pull an app published by the Saudi government that helps men keep track of women and prevent them from leaving the country. </p>
<p> Say what you will about the latest crop of Android Wear devices, but it would be hard to call any of them "feminine." Even with gold-plated bodies or thin bands, the chunky or boxy nature of the watches mean that they don't easily conform to the current designs of women's conventional watches. (For my money, the most svelte looking Android Wear device right now is the Asus Zenwatch 2.) But Huawei is willing to give it a shot: a few months ago we caught wind of two new variants of the Huawei Watch, the "Jewel" and the "Elegant," and now it appears both of them will soon be available in the US. </p>
<p> Look, we'll talk about menstrual cycles, periods, and cramps in this post. If you feel uncomfortable discussing this topic, move along, but just remember that your entire existence hinged on this very thing. 'K? Now that that's settled, let's get back to our app. </p>
<p> Every couple of months, I spend hours — literally hours, i.e. multiples of sixty minutes — researching period trackers on the Play Store. And every time, I end up with the need to go to a garden to rip out every single flower, throw it on the floor, and stomp violently on it. Yes, I'm a woman, and I may like flowers and pink, but does it mean that I have to suffer offensively cheerful and childish app designs like this, this, or this to track the thing that makes my life a living hell for a few days every month? </p>

<p> wonderboom </p>
<p> Sometimes, the best places to sit back and kick up the music are also a bit perilous for fragile electronics. Whether you're heading to the beach, hiking a nearby trail, or taking a float trip downstream, you're going to need a rugged Bluetooth speaker that can withstand the journey ahead. The Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2 for just $69.99 ($30 off) on Amazon and other retailers was built to endure all of these challenging environments and more. </p>
<p> The sheer abundance of Bluetooth speakers on the market can be overwhelming, but a few brands have managed to rise to prominence — Ultimate Ears, better known as UE, being one of them. Over-sized volume controls and an emphasis on cylindrical designs have helped the brand achieve recognizability in a crowded category. Today, both Amazon and Best Buy have the first-generation UE Wonderboom available for as little as $40. </p>
<p> A couple years back, Ultimate Ears released the Wonderboom, a squat little speaker that delivered great sound at a good price. With some attractive color pairings, and big, easy-to-use controls, there was a lot to like about the speaker, though there was also clearly still room to grow. Now UE’s ready with its follow-up, launching the Wonderboom 2 earlier this summer. </p>
<p> The original Ultimate Ears Wonderboom was a tiny and cute little portable Bluetooth speaker that could float on water and sounded pretty decent — all for just $100. There was little not to love about it, a sentiment echoed by Jeff in our review. It must have been a good seller for UE owner Logitech, too, as it's seen fit to bring out an updated version with better sound and more features. </p>
<p> Bluetooth speakers are usually a good idea for gift giving, and UE's offerings are often a strong bet. The Wonderboom is currently on sale for $69.99. Costco has a two-pack for $109.99, making each speaker $55. Either way, you get $30 off the full price. </p>

<p> Don't let the long name and all-caps fool you; the WONDERBOOM 2 is Ultimate Ears' smallest speaker offering. It was announced earlier this month, but prices are already being slashed by $20/20% to $79.99. If the regular BOOM speakers are just too big for your liking, you might want to look into this. </p>

<p> wood </p>
<p> OnePlus has a lot of things going for its phones. They're usually the least expensive way to get flagship specs like the latest high-end Qualcomm SoC, and the software experience is close to stock Android. But, in my opinion, their best feature isn't something you're likely to notice unless you spend a bit more time and money on the company's store. That's because the first-party wood and Kevlar cases OnePlus sells are, without exception, the single nicest I've ever used. </p>
<p> Like it or not, it's clear that Motorola's often-leaked upcoming batch of phones will be very different from the relatively straightforward designs in its current lineup. Previous leaks indicated that at least some of the models in the refreshed Moto X (or possibly Moto Z) and DROID series will have add-on modules called "MotoMod" that snap onto the back of the phone via a proprietary interface. It's a lot like the direction that LG is taking with its modular G5. </p>
<p> Motorola announced new pricing for the long-delayed wood back option for the Moto X last week. The excitement of the $25 price point was tempered by the indeterminate release date of "coming soon." Well, it was pretty soon – the Moto X is now available with ebony, teak, walnut, or bamboo backs for just $25 extra. </p>
<p> Motorola has just announced the much anticipated expansion of its wood finishes for the Moto X. The Walnut, Teak and Ebony versions of the device will be available on January 21st for an extra $25. If you're more of a minimalist person, the bamboo version of the Moto X has been dropped to $25 starting today. </p>
<p> The Bamboo option debuted a few weeks ago at $100, so the price drop to $25 might annoy those who dropped the cash already. Still, Moto says it wants wood finishes to be affordable for everyone. Motorola is handing out $75 credits to those who bought the bamboo at full price, but the coupons are only good on accessory orders of $75 or more (not including the Chromecast). </p>
<p> It looks very likely to be the case that Motorola will be charging a little extra for the wooden backs on the Moto X, and by a little, I mean in the neighborhood of $50 compared to the plastic X. Is there $50 of wood, workmanship, and assembly there to justify this premium? Of course not. It's an option that, like most "premium" add-ons for everything from cars to kitchen appliances, is there for those people willing to pay to get it. No one needs a phone made of wood, aluminum, or rich Corinthian leather. It's an upsell, and if you think you're generally going to get a "fair" price on an option that isn't included with the base model product, you're probably deluding yourself. </p>
<p> The Moto X has been making headlines as of late for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is the astoundingly versatile Motomaker. Motomaker lets you to customize your phone to a degree that we've never seen before, allowing for a staggering total of 504 unique color combinations. Don't gasp in amazement at that number just yet, though. It looks like Motorola is preparing Motomaker to include the wooden backs we saw last month at the phone's unveiling. A quick peek at the code of the Motomaker webpage reveals that, though hidden to the common viewer (perhaps part of the checkout process), wooden Moto X backs are waiting patiently to make their debut and, further, that they will cost an additional $50. </p>
<p> Wood block apps are a f*!#ing joke. Most of them don't even have mallet options or choices for wood weight or grain type. Fakeblock, which is now free on the Play Store...well, actually, it also doesn't have any of those options. But! It is still the most phenomenal block-of-wood-simulator that you will ever have the privilege of installing on your device. </p>
<p> We've been waiting for this app to launch ever since the big Cinco de Quatro event where CEO George Maharis announced that the app is "real" and encouraged us to "put up this wall." The company has already received several rounds of funding including $50,000 from an unnamed executive of a real estate company. </p>

<p> Arcade cabinet mods are certainly nothing new. Ever since the kids of the late 70s and early 80s grew up into the adults of the late 90s and early aughts, the internet has been filled with folks building wooden boxes around computers and joysticks. Today's example, though, uses an Android tablet and a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom fight stick for what might be one of the cheapest, easiest-to-replicate Arcade cabinets around. </p>

<p> If you're not sure whether you should watch movies in the living room or the bedroom, why not settle for a portable projector that you can place wherever you want? Anker's Nebula Mars II mobile projector is currently on sale, down to just $330 on eBay. </p>

<p> Samsung's bean-shaped Galaxy Buds Live were only released a couple months ago, but we're already starting to see decent sales. Now you can get the earbuds for as low as $135 from Amazon-owned Woot, a discount of $35 from the typical price. </p>
<p> Google may have given up on tablets, but Amazon is still holding on for dear life. The company's Fire tablets have always been about providing value to customers for low price points, and right now Woot is offering some of the lowest prices around on older generation Fire tablets — including the 2018 Fire HD 8 for just $49.99. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/08/17 1:58pm PDTon Aug 17, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/23 8:53am PDTon Sep 23, 2020. </p>
<p> JBL produces dozens of speakers and other audio products designed for outdoor/water use. One of them is the JBL Charge 4 speaker, which is a bit old at this point, but is still an excellent portable Bluetooth speaker. Now you can get it from Woot for just $89.99, and other JBL audio products are on sale too. </p>
<p> We'd like to think Mother Nature can take care of our lawns just fine on her own, but unfortunately, that's not true in most locations. Luckily, you can be your own Mother Nature with the Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller. Once connected to your existing setup, you'll be able to schedule waterings optimized for your lawn that help save water and money. Today on Woot, you can grab a factory reconditioned 2nd generation unit for just $79.99. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 7T has been discounted to $399.99 several times in the past couple of months, and the same deal is back again if you missed out on it previously. The 7T may no longer be the newest OnePlus phone, but it offers a ton of bang for the buck at this price point. </p>
<p> Android 11 is here, and we're sure you want to try it out — the only issue is it being limited to the Pixel series and a few beta releases right now. What if you don't have one of those? Well, if the Pixel 4a is still out of your price range, or you're looking for a phone with a bigger screen, you're in luck: Woot has the Pixel 3a XL on sale for just $300. </p>
<p> The fall semester's starting up, and with many schools opting for remote learning, Chromebooks are hotter than ever. Unfortunately, that means that most are out of stock. If you're fine with a refurbished unit, Woot is offering some higher-end Chromebooks right now for decent prices. </p>
<p> If you missed out on the Galaxy Buds+ deal from around a week ago, you're in luck. Woot is currently offering the same (well, technically a dollar pricier) deal: the Buds+ for $99.99. If you're an Amazon Prime member, you get free shipping as well. </p>

<p> The original Google Wifi system was first released in late 2016, and even though it has been replaced by the slightly-better Nest Wifi, the first-gen system is still an upgrade over many mesh networks available today.

<p> A couple of weeks ago, we tipped you off to a pretty great deal on a 32GB Transformer Pad Infinity from Woot. The first sale must have been a success because Tech.Woot is back with the 64GB model for just $440 + $5 shipping. Amazon's price has never dipped below $480 for this exact model, and it currently resides at $530. </p>
<p> Like before, these are brand new units without the keyboard dock, which can be found for $126 here. </p>
<p> When it comes to using a tablet as a laptop replacement, the first place anybody should look is the ASUS Transformer line. At the top of that hill stands the TF700T, reviewed here. If you happen to be in the market, Woot is offering the Transformer Pad Infinity for just $369.99 + $5 shipping. These are new units, not refurbished. </p>
<p> I know, you're wondering why a tablet released 9 months ago would still be attractive. </p>
<p> Whether you are trying to score a great deal or just read the product descriptions, you've probably used Woot before. In fact, there's a good chance you've already used the service on your Android device, as there are several Woot apps available in the Play Store. But Woot Check, a brand new app from GT Media, the developers of SeekDroid, takes things to an impressive new level. </p>
<p> Side note: Technically, Woot Check was GT Media's first app, but it wasn't anything special at the time and what you see here today is a completely rewritten product that benefitted from all the experience of developing SeekDroid. </p>
<p> Today has been a great day for those looking to get their hands on Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1. Earlier, we saw the 10.1 on sale from Daily Steals at $340 with free shipping, and now Woot is offering a refurbished 16GB 10.1 for just $319.99 with $5 shipping. If you're worried about the Tab's "refurbished" status, don't fret – this usually just means you'll receive a unit that was purchased and returned, possibly even unopened. </p>
<p> The enTourage eDGe Dualbook is one of the more interesting devices released last year due to its 2 screens - a 7" touchscreen LCD and a 6" e-Ink. Similar to the Spring Design Alex eReader, the Dualbook lets you read ebooks on one screen while simultaneously Googling, browsing Wikipedia, checking email, and doing anything Android lets you do on the other screen. However, if you find yourself reading late at night, just throw the book over to the LCD screen, and suddenly you can read in the dark. </p>
<p> You Woot, right? Of course you do - everyone does. If you want to keep tabs on this Internet addiction, you should check out WootWatcher. </p>
<p> If you're 1 of the 3 people left who aren’t familiar with Woot, it is a family of sites which includes Shirt.Woot, Wine.Woot, Sellout.Woot, Kids.Woot, and the main site, Woot.com. Every night at 12:00 AM CST, each site puts up a new deal that is available for 24 hours or until it sells out, which ever comes first. </p>

<p> Once upon a time, you could view and edit Google Docs files from a single Drive app, but Google later split them up into multiple editing applications. Microsoft is now doing the reverse: it's combining the Android versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into one app to rule them all. </p>
<p> Microsoft has been testing a new Office mobile app for Android since this spring, which combines Microsoft's mobile variants of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into one. The relatively new app gives you a convenient, cloud-synchronized central point for Microsoft Office document creation and management, plus scanning, notes, and more. It's an all-in-one, on-the-go Microsoft Office solution, and now it's available in public preview. </p>
<p> Even though cloud-based productivity suites like Google Docs are incredibly popular, many people (and large corporations) still operate on good ol' Microsoft Office. The Word text processor was Microsoft's first Android app to pass 500 million installs on the Play Store, and a little over a year later, it has now passed the 1 billion mark. </p>
<p> Cloud-based services like Google Docs have replaced old-fashioned word processors for some of us, but plenty of people still want to open Microsoft Word files. So many, in fact, that Microsoft Word for Android has hit the 500 million install milestone in the Play Store. That's the first app published by Microsoft (not counting Skype) to reach that number. </p>
<p> For years, one of the most common complaints about Chromebooks was that they couldn't run the Office suite of applications. Microsoft has offered Android apps for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for a few years now, but they weren't made available to all Chromebooks for some reason. </p>
<p> After Google improved the Docs, Sheets, and Slides apps a few weeks ago, Microsoft is responding with updates to the Android apps for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The update adds small, incremental improvements which won't matter to the vast majority, but for a little subset of users, might be the thing that gets them to use one or all of the apps. </p>
<p> Microsoft PowerPoint </p>
<p> The major thing that's new in PowerPoint is the ability to share only one slide. It can get really annoying when to send one slide in a presentation of many slides, you have to send the entire thing and say 'look at slide 22,' or whatever. </p>
<p> Third-party cloud storage platforms like Dropbox and Box have been available in desktop versions of Microsoft Office for a few years, but the mobile versions have been much more limited. Oh, they supported OneDrive, but who uses that? Starting today, you have new storage options and a few more on on the way. </p>
<p> Microsoft has long since abandoned the strategy of keeping its apps and services confined to its own platform. Windows Phone didn't really work out, so it's not like there's another option. Microsoft's Word, PowerPoint, and Excel apps are getting a nice update today on Android that makes them better at handling shared content. PowerPoint also gets some UI tweaks. </p>
<p> In the latest series of updates to Microsoft's Office apps for Android, the headlining feature is inking support with a couple of other minor additions. Of those, the one most likely to affect your day-to-day use is that each app now allows for saving to SD cards. </p>
<p> Still, the most exciting part of these updates is inking. As the name suggests, this is digital ink. You can draw with your finger or stylus, as I did in the image below. If you have a phone or tablet with an active digitizer like the Samsung Note series, they will support those pressure-sensitive features as well. </p>

<p> Kuato Studios have announced the release of Marvel Hero Tales, an educational storytelling app designed to promote literacy for children (ages 7-11). Each story is themed around famous Marvel characters (much like a comic book), and it will be the user's job to flesh out the narrative by choosing from a selection of words. Essentially, players can create their own personal superhero story while also improving their vocabulary development. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a fantastic retro-inspired platformer, a sequel to a popular minimal puzzler, a unique word game, a colorful platformer that uses a slingshot mechanic for movement, an online-multiplayer board game adaptation, and a Godzilla-themed defense game from Nexon. </p>
<p> In 2013, the Daily Express ran an informal poll that determined Winston Churchill's famous response to a Parliament member, "Yes I am drunk, but in the morning I shall be sober and you will still be ugly," to be the best insult in history. That's certainly debatable, but it demonstrates that the Brits love a good jape, the more cutting the better. That attitude has been given life in Oh... Sir! The Insult Simulator, a turn-based combat game where insults are your weapons and words are your ammunition. </p>

Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a digital board game, a ninja-themed endless runner, an interesting online MOBA, a fast-paced take on Tetris, and a word game with adorable bears. Without further ado: </p>
<p> Splendor </p>
<p> Splendor is the latest board game from the makers of the popular Ticket to Ride series. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a mix of Minecraft and tower defense, a unique hand-drawn racer, a word puzzle game, and an old-school top down shooter. Without further ado: </p>
<p> Block Fortress </p>
<p> Regular Minecraft players know that the game's day and night cycle already includes some de facto tower defense elements, but Block Fortress expands the exploding bad guy combat into a fully-fledged first person shooter and defense crossover. </p>
<p> In case you've forgotten that Microsoft knows how to have fun (and I can understand why you would), there's a certain game console it produces that has sold millions (hint, its name is plastered across the top of this game's icon). Now the company is sharing more of its light-hearted side with Android users. Its latest release is a port of a Windows word-building game that goes by the name of Snap Attack. </p>
<p> The game places movable letter tiles on a board and tasks players with building words. Some of the letters are locked in place, and there's a short time limit that keeps the pressure high. </p>
<p> We all remember Tiny Thief, but let's set those memories aside for a moment. Rovio Stars is back with another Android title. Word Monsters is a puzzle game that's so social, it requires players to sign in using Google or Facebook immediately after completing the initial tutorial. The game itself is an adorable take on word search. Look for words on-screen and swipe them to get points. Doing so will cause them to disappear, sometimes removing letters needed for future words and adding some degree of strategy to the experience. In typical Rovio fashion, Word Monsters is easy on the eyes, even if it is undeniably basic this time around. </p>

<p> word games </p>
<p> As a fan of minimal word games, I thought it might be a good idea to round up a few of my favorites. I find that I often get annoyed by busy UIs, especially in word games, so I tend to lean more towards the titles that are built with a focus on gameplay instead of bright colors and shiny buttons. This is why I've hand-selected ten of the best Android word games that offer a minimalist theme. Instead of placing these games in order of my personal preference, I've listed them out by order of price, which should make it easy for everyone to find the titles that suit them best. </p>
<p> In 2013, the Daily Express ran an informal poll that determined Winston Churchill's famous response to a Parliament member, "Yes I am drunk, but in the morning I shall be sober and you will still be ugly," to be the best insult in history. That's certainly debatable, but it demonstrates that the Brits love a good jape, the more cutting the better. That attitude has been given life in Oh... Sir! The Insult Simulator, a turn-based combat game where insults are your weapons and words are your ammunition. </p>
<p> In Wordbase, you have to reach the opponents base not by traversing mountains and flanking opposing forces, but with your words. You'll get there one letter at a time, even if you have to fight dirty. It's a licentious linguistic battle, but no one ever said it'd be pretty. </p>
<p> The game board in Wordbase is essentially a giant word hunt puzzle. However, unlike those games, you can pick out words in any direction and along diagonals – the letters just have to connected to each other in some way. The goal is to create a branch of letters that reaches your opponent's side of the board, but there are also power ups that can swing the match in your favor, and let's not forget you can always go out of your way to maliciously block your opponent's branch. </p>

Without further ado: </p>
<p> Fractal Combat X (Premium) </p>
<p> Flight simulators are pretty tough to pull off on touchscreens, so those that make it to the Play Store tend to go for the casual approach, fitting in somewhere between Wing Commander and Space Harrier. </p>
<p> Fans of dystopian stories in the vein of 1984 and Fahrenheit 451 will want to take note of a new arrival in Google Play. Blackbar is a word puzzle that has you decipher letters sent to you by a friend after they've been filtered through the insidious Department of Communication. Things start to go wrong for your friend, but you'll only be able to figure out what's happening if you fill in the blanks and make it to the next page. </p>

<p> Word Lens </p>
<p> Welcome to the future. No, really, it's the future, right here and right now. And not just because we've got mobile processors that can calculate Pi to the ten trillionth digit, or because our video games are starting to look more like movies than games. Nope, what makes me feel like I'm living in The Future(TM) more than anything else is how all that pie-in-the-sky Moore's Law tech gets applied to solving very human problems, like figuring out where the exit is in the Jakarta airport. </p>
<p> Case in point: Google's Translate app is applying the Word Lens visual translate tool, which lets you point your phone's camera to a sign or piece of paper and see the text in your native language, to 20 new languages. </p>
<p> We had an exclusive preview of upcoming changes to the Google Translate app last month, and Google just announced an update that matches exactly with our information. The new version of Translate is rolling out on Android and iOS with built-in Word Lens translation via the camera and a smarter conversation mode that can listen to both languages at once. </p>
<p> Update: Both Google and Word Lens declined to comment on the details of the future of the app or acquisition, other than to confirm an acquisition had occurred. </p>
<p> Makers of the exceptionally popular AR translation app Word Lens, Quest Visual, have been acquired by Google, according to the company's website. Quest's tech will be merged into Google's Translate products. </p>
<p> The statement from the company is as follows: </p>
<p> With Word Lens, we've seen the beginnings of what's possible when we harness the power of mobile devices to "see the world in your language." </p>
<p> By joining Google, we can incorporate Quest Visual's technology into Google Translate's broad language coverage and translation capabilities in the future. </p>
<p> Those of you lucky enough to be visiting Sochi, Russia for the 2014 Winter Olympics might not have opulent luxuries like floors or potable water, but at least getting around town will be a little easier thanks to the Word Lens app. The developers added support for Russian today, allowing users to translate signs, menus, and other text on the fly. </p>
<p> If you've never used Word Lens, then you really should, at least if you're frequently traveling to places that don't speak your native language. The app uses augmented reality to translate text from one language to another, then re-insert it into the live image from your phone's camera. </p>
<p> Word Lens is the kind of app that might not get daily use, but when you do fire it up, it can save your bacon with fast offline translations. This is not just any translation app, though. Word Lens uses your device's camera to overlay the text translation using optical character recognition. Well, this app just got a nice little update to version 2.1 with some new features. </p>
<p> Word Lens now supports Portuguese ⇄ English translations, but it's not included with the app. Word Lens has a slightly confusing payment system. The $4.99 paid version comes with one language pack of your choice. </p>
<p> Word Lens, the sometimes jittery but generally impressive visual language translator, is getting in the Olympic spirit. For a limited time, the language packs—which are acquired via in-app purchases to unlock full translation support—are being offered for $2.99 per pack, which is $2 off the normal price of $4.99. Huzzah! </p>
<p> It comes at a particularly poignant time. As the Olympic games get underway and the world remembers there's more that the nations of earth do together than wage war and make gadgets, Word Lens can be helpful in breaking down the language barrier and acting as a catalyst for that type of international camaraderie. </p>
<p> I first saw Word Lens for iOS on TechCrunch back in 2010 and instantly fell in love with the concept - just point the camera at foreign words, and all of them get translated in front of your very eyes, live. Amazing, isn't it? If you haven't seen this promo video yet, watch it first: </p>
<p> Every month since, I searched the Play Store for Word Lens, hoping its developers brought it to our favorite OS, but found nothing. Eventually, during my trip to Spain, I started using CamDictionary, which did a decent job but was too cumbersome to use and lacked many words in the dictionary. </p>
<p> Have you ever been in a foreign country and tried to find your way around, order from a menu, or read a map in a language that you don’t understand? Language barriers can be incredibly frustrating, but we found a new app designed to go head-to-head with iOS’s Word Lens that can help you next time you’re in that kind of situation. </p>
<p> CamTranslator is a new app from IntSig that is designed to help break the communication barrier between languages using your phone’s camera. It includes a massive collection of over 50 languages that will translate both ways, two different modes of translation, and a few other quaint features. </p>

<p> A few months ago Google purchased the developer of the impressive WordLens app, which translates text and signs from another language into your own simply by pointing your camera at it. The text appears in your language through the lens, as if you had super-powered Translate-O-Vision. As with Waze and Google Maps, it looks like Google's own Translate app will soon see the benefit of that acquisition. Check out the screenshots below, taken from an upcoming version of Google Translate. </p>
<p> Wondering what that sign says, but you don't speak the lingo? You might want to figure it out – signs convey important information. Maybe it says "keep off the grass," but it could also say "high risk of electric shock." Word Lens can help with that by doing live translation of text using optical character recognition and the camera. It's neat, and the newest version adds support for tablets. </p>
<p> WordLens is one of those borderline-magical apps that make me feel like I'm living in a scifi novel. The initial release was a little buggy, and the UI made it clear the app was a direct port from iOS. The 2.0 update just dropped, though, and it takes care of a lot of those issues. </p>
<p> If you've never heard of WordLens, here's the deal: hold your phone up to a sign or some other thing with words on it, and WordLens uses your camera to translate those words to another language of your choosing in real time. </p>
<p> Google Translate, the frequently-overlooked wonder app of the 3rd millennium, got some new features today. Chief among them is an amazing new image-based translation mechanism. The app now supports use of your camera to take a picture of the text you would like to translate. Once that's done, just "brush" over the word or phrase you need to read and Translate will do what it says on the tin: render that text in your preferred language. </p>
<p> I first saw Word Lens for iOS on TechCrunch back in 2010 and instantly fell in love with the concept - just point the camera at foreign words, and all of them get translated in front of your very eyes, live. Amazing, isn't it? If you haven't seen this promo video yet, watch it first: </p>

<p> Squarespace is a one-stop-shop allowing you to build your own website with practically no prior experience: Changes in the editor show you an exact representation of the final product. While the desktop back end has worked great for many users for a long time, the rise of smartphones and the shift to our always-online culture might require you to edit your website on the move. This is where Squarespace's completely reworked Android app comes into play, allowing you to edit posts, manage blogs and galleries, and access basic analytics. </p>
<p> While personal blogs aren't really the thing they once were, Google believes they "add to the vitality of the web." To that end, the company has introduced Blog Compass, a new platform for managing blogs. The app is currently only available as a beta in India, but it could come to more regions depending on its popularity and user feedback. </p>
<p> This post is a bit meta, as Android Police itself is a WordPress-powered site. But anyone who uses WordPress will appreciate the massive, much-needed feature introduced in the beta version of the Android app today: finally, a true visual editor. </p>
<p> You see, previous versions of the WordPress Android app have offered a semi-functional visual editor when publishing or editing content, but this editor was extremely basic. Certain formatting and content like bolding, italicizing, underlining, strikethrough, quote blocks, hyperlinks, and images could be previewed live in the editor - but only when publishing a new post. When editing an existing post, the shortcuts for these tools were still available on the toolbar at the bottom of the screen, but they inserted the naked HTML markup into the editor, because the editor was, to use the technical term, janky as hell. </p>
<p> The WordPress Android app probably won't have you closing your laptop to go do most of your blogging from the backseat of a car, but it does a decent enough job, and the app looks pretty. The latest version of the app continues the march towards both replicating the desktop experience and integrating with Android's design language. </p>
<p> Version 4.9 spruced up the screen that tells you the size of your images and their file names. You can also upload multiple images and video clips at a time. </p>
<p> The changelog mentions unlocking the screen using your fingerprint, a feature that presumably only appears on devices with the necessary hardware. </p>
<p> The WordPress developers have bumped the Android app up to version 4.4, introducing a number of visual tweaks in the process. Some of them are better for phones than they are for tablets. Whether they're an improvement is for you to judge. </p>
<p> For starters, the page and post list page has changed from two panels into a list of floating titles. You can see the headline, a few lines of text, and a featured image. Edit, Preview, Stats, and Trash options line the bottom. </p>
<p> This change results in less information displayed on tablets in landscape mode than we saw in previous versions. </p>
<p> WordPress went material in version 3.5. Now in 4.1, the app has undergone what may be an even larger design change. Say goodbye to the navigation menu you're used to sliding out from the side of the screen. Now everything you need is tucked away inside four tabs spread along the action bar at the top. </p>
<p> The first tab, which also serves as the landing screen, provides just about everything you'd expect in the side menu. From here you can view your site and open posts. When you click the back button, it takes you back to this page. </p>
<p> The second tab shows posts from Freshly Pressed, WordPress's blog. </p>
<p> Folks editing their WordPress blogs from an Android device running Lollipop are in for a treat. The latest version of the app applies a fresh taste of material design. At the end of the day, the experience doesn't look fundamentally different, but you get a full hamburger menu, a floating action button, and a sidebar that slides out on top of everything else. </p>
<p> The WordPress Android app isn't the most feature-rich means of editing a blog, but it's arguably the quickest. The latest version of the software brings about a number of improvements that round out the experience. The list of a site's posts now refreshes automatically, but there's still the option to refresh manually either through the menu or by pulling down on the screen. This update also brings in the ability to infinitely swipe through posts. In addition to that, the QuickPress widget has been fixed, though you're not missing out on much if you haven't used it before. All it does is link to the app's new post page. </p>
<p> The official WordPress app for Android got a significant bump to version 3.0 today. Users who host a free blog on WordPress.com will see the greatest benefit from the added features, but just about everyone will see something new, and the bug fixes don't hurt either. The app doesn't have much to show in the user interface department, though it's been pretty solid since the Holo redesign in any case. </p>
<p> First of all, you should now be able to swipe left and right to advance or go back between individual posts in the "View site" option on the sidebar. </p>
<p> Like most tech blogs, Android Police uses WordPress. And since the web interface still leaves a lot to be desired on phones and tablets, we rely on the WordPress app to make quick adjustments when we're out and about. The latest update to the official app isn't exactly revolutionary, but anyone who uses it on a regular basis will probably find a few things to like. </p>
<p> First: the refresh button is no more. It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to its designer. Instead, users can now refresh the list of blog posts and drafts by dragging down on the list, a la Gmail and lots of other trendy apps. </p>

<p> word processing </p>
<p> There's a pretty basic version of Microsoft Office available for Android in the Play Store, but you won't have much luck trying to install that on anything much larger than a Galaxy Note or Nexus 6. For tablets, the company has something different in the works, and it's now ready to give out tastes to Android users who are eager enough to sign up and get in line. </p>
<p> Traditionally word processors have tasked themselves with producing nice, printable documents. Mobile versions have followed up with the unenviable task of replicating this functionality on much smaller screens. Quip throws this entire concept out of the window, instead creating a writing experience built for the ground up for mobile devices. The team released an alpha version over the summer, but it was little more than a demo of the iOS version of the app. </p>
<p> There are no shortage of office suites available for Android, but two of the most popular have been Quickoffice and OfficeSuite. The former took a hiatus after Google purchased it last year, and while the new version isn't bad per se, it's not what to used to be. In the meantime, OfficeSuite has continued to improve, and version 7.3 introduces a slew of new features that add an extra layer of polish to what is already a solid app. </p>
<p> Google bought Quickoffice a while back, but didn't really say what it had planned. Well, now we know at least part of the deal. Google has relaunched the Quickoffice app on Android. It's completely free now, and has a new interface and tight integration with Google Drive. </p>
<p> Word processors were designed for desktop computers. Given that many of us still sit down at laptops or desktops when it's time to type, that isn't too much of issue. We generally consider those to be better devices for typing than tablets or smartphones, but how much of this stems from our reliance on software that isn't designed to truly adapt to mobile screens and interfaces? Quip is a freemium new word processing app designed explicitly for mobile devices, and it's hoping to change word processing to match our new lifestyles. </p>

<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got an amusing kart racing game with a Chuck E. Cheese theme, and adorable kawaii-themed falling object game, a Doctor Who match-3 puzzler that includes some fantastic storylines, a beautiful escape room game, the much awaited sequel to the hit word-based puzzle game Alphabear, a new idle game from PIKPOK, and an enjoyable cross-platform sidescrolling shooter. </p>
<p> Words With Friends 2 - Word Game was recently launched on the Play Store as the follow-up sequel to Zynga's popular Scrabble clone Words With Friends. It is something of an odd release as it is more an expansion of the original gameplay than a true sequel. This luckily means that you can carry over your account and any game you are currently playing in the original to this new release without a hitch. It also means you can expect all of the same gameplay, but with a few new modes and words to play around with. </p>
<p> The first and last time I attempted to solve a crossword was on a 12-hour flight from Amman to Chicago where I just couldn't sleep or do anything else. I love word and math games, but for some reason, crosswords never really hit the right spot for me, so I just gloss over them when I come across one. But I know a lot of people who absolutely dig crosswords. And for them, the New York Times is the epitome of puzzles. </p>
<p> Now those same puzzles, which were previously only available on iOS and the web, are also accessible on your Android phone through the NYTimes Crossword app. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we have a Dig Dug-style tower defense game, a colorful puzzler, a physics puzzler with cars, an interesting word search game, a minimal RPG, and a licensed sequel to high-end boxing game Real Boxing. </p>

<p> We all remember Tiny Thief, but let's set those memories aside for a moment. Rovio Stars is back with another Android title. Word Monsters is a puzzle game that's so social, it requires players to sign in using Google or Facebook immediately after completing the initial tutorial. The game itself is an adorable take on word search. Look for words on-screen and swipe them to get points. Doing so will cause them to disappear, sometimes removing letters needed for future words and adding some degree of strategy to the experience. </p>
<p> When it comes time to learn a new language on a mobile device (what, you haven't?), Duolingo is the first that comes to mind. But let's say you've completed everything that app has to offer - what then? Lingua.ly has arrived for Android, and it's ready to help newcomers learn any of over twenty languages. </p>
<p> As a writer, I pretty much like words. That's my job. Well, it's not my job to like words, but it helps. It's my job to write words in a coherent and entertaining manner. But I digress, this isn't about stringing words together into sentences; it's about stacking words on top of each other in a Tetris-like game for the aspiring wordsmith. Sure, it may sound a bit confusing, but in reality the concept appears to be relatively simple. </p>
<p> Over on the iOS side of things, W.E.L.D.E.R. has made quite a name for itself with unique word-based gameplay and a real sense of humor. Now you too can get in on the fun with W.E.L.D.E.R. on your Android device of choice. Make sure you check out the video below so you know what you're getting into. This is serious business. </p>
<p> W.E.L.D.E.R. is a bit like a combination of Boggle, Scrabble, and Bejeweled. </p>
<p> There are two things I know about chess for sure: I like playing it and I hate playing against computers. Computers are cold, calculating, and just generally smarter than me. They don't make mistakes. They want to take over my planet with their cold, metal claw-hands and laser eyes. If something is going to make me feel stupid, it damn well better be a person. This is why I like Chess-presso. </p>

<p> word search </p>
<p> As a fan of minimal word games, I thought it might be a good idea to round up a few of my favorites. I find that I often get annoyed by busy UIs, especially in word games, so I tend to lean more towards the titles that are built with a focus on gameplay instead of bright colors and shiny buttons. This is why I've hand-selected ten of the best Android word games that offer a minimalist theme. Instead of placing these games in order of my personal preference, I've listed them out by order of price, which should make it easy for everyone to find the titles that suit them best. </p>

<p> words with friends </p>
<p> Words With Friends 2 - Word Game was recently launched on the Play Store as the follow-up sequel to Zynga's popular Scrabble clone Words With Friends. It is something of an odd release as it is more an expansion of the original gameplay than a true sequel. This luckily means that you can carry over your account and any game you are currently playing in the original to this new release without a hitch. It also means you can expect all of the same gameplay, but with a few new modes and words to play around with. </p>
<p> Chances are you're one of the everyone-on-the-planet who's played Words With Friends. Did you know there's other, shall we say, homages to classic board games available for your Android phone? For example, here we have Pictionary Draw Something, a turn-based, doodle-guessing game that you can play with friends wherever they are. </p>
<p> Draw Something has more than a few similarities to crowd-favorite Words With Friends. You're able to add your friends or join a game with a random player, and play multiple games at once. Games are also turn-based, so you can create a doodle and let your partner guess what it is when they're free. </p>
<p> Ah, Words With Friends. What was once one of the most anticipated games on Android quickly becme one of the most hated due to its bug-laden nature and lack of good support. The app has now received another update that NOT only brings "loads of bug fixes" - call me skeptical, but I'll believe that when I see it - but a new Words with Friends store. Yeah, a store. </p>
<p> So, what kind of things can you buy from this store? Let's call them... enhancements. While some of these "enhancements" seem to be basic and fair (like ad-removal for example), others ride the border of paid cheating. </p>
<p> Exactly one week ago we told you that Words With Friends dropped Honeycomb support. At the time, there was little explanation as to what happened (even Zynga support staff was completely clueless), but things are starting to make a bit more sense now (albeit not much). </p>
<p> Zynga pushed an update to Words With Friends today that brought something new to the table: full Honeycomb support. I'm still not entirely sure why they decided to drop Honeycomb support for one week - but it doesn't really matter now, as WWF is now fully playable on your Android-powered tablet. </p>
<p> Ignore those two losses on the side - I forgot I was playing and lost by default. </p>
<p> If you play the popular Scrabble clone Words With Friends on a Honeycomb tablet, then you may have noticed something a bit odd lately: it no longer shows up in the app tray. That's because Zynga - apparently unknowingly to its support staff - dropped Honeycomb support from the game. When one of our readers tried to contact Zynga asking why WWF was no longer supported on Android 3.0+, this is the response that was received: </p>
<p> Thank you for contacting Zynga With Friends Customer Support! </p>
<p> Currently, Words With Friends and Chess With Friends are only supported on Apple iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch) and Android devices. </p>
<p> Words With Friends, the wildly popular iOS game by everyone's favorite company Zynga, has come to Android, after weeks of anticipation. WWF is one of the most addicting and well made word games on the planet, and as of a few hours ago, you can download it for free from the Android Market. </p>
<p> Here's the best part: Words With Friends is cross-platform, so you can play up to 20 simultaneous games and kick your iOS buddies' butts all at the same time. In-game chat and push notifications that tell you when it's your turn will help keeping you addicted. According to Zynga, the game looks great on both Android handsets and tablets, so fire up all your brain cells - you're going to need them. </p>

<p> Dark mode has finally started to take root recently, with popular apps WhatsApp and OneDrive joining the roster this month. Now Adobe is jumping on the bandwagon too, adding dark mode support to Acrobat Reader. With over half a billion downloads, this should please a lot of users who don't like having their corneas burnt to a crisp during the night. </p>
<p> Smart displays are still in their infancy. While they might take inspiration from the basic internet appliances that failed to take off in the 2000s (anyone remember the Chumby One?), smart displays as we know them today started with Amazon's Echo Show. The idea of adding a screen to a smart speaker may have sounded counterproductive at the time, since they essentially are less-versatile tablets, but smart displays have been an undeniable hit with buyers. </p>
<p> Finding the right job is pretty hard, as I'm sure we can all attest to. It's also not an easy task for employers looking to find the best candidates, as proven by the statistic that 75% of them struggle to hire people who are the right fit. In the US, Spain, and some parts of Africa, Google has offered a service built right into Search that aids users in their job hunt. It's now coming to the UK. </p>
<p> Work-life balance can be tricky. Google Calendar is getting a couple of additions that will hopefully make it easier to delineate when your work time ends and your personal time begins: soon, G Suite users will be able to set both their normal work hours as well as mark when they're out of the office. </p>
<p> Panasonic's Toughbook line has been around for a while, offering rugged devices for those workers who need them. They're not cheap, and neither is its latest Toughbook product: the FZ-T1. Like most of these devices, this ~$1500 handheld has some downright mediocre specs for the price, but at least it has Android 8.1 Oreo. </p>
<p> Back at Google I/O, a new initiative was announced called 'Google for Jobs.' As you might be able to guess from the name, it is designed to make finding job openings easier and more effective - for both applicants and employers. The feature appears to be going live on Google Search, at least for some users. </p>
<p> 5217, a productivity app made by well-known developer Francisco Franco, has been updated with a new Freemium payment model. Anyone that might be interested in trying new methods for boosting productivity can install the app and give it a try for 10 free work cycles. In addition to the new payment model, 5217 has been updated to include a host of new notification options, Android Wear support, and stats for users. </p>
<p> Microsoft's Work Folders, which is for organizational accounts, allows you to sync work files across devices and access them while offline. For important internal documents, having employees using their own computers and phones to access them is a bit of a security nightmare. Work Folders is a compromise, adding some more protection—and convenience—to allow people to work with potentially sensitive information that is stored on an organization's server. </p>
<p> While this feature is well-integrated into Windows (as you might have expected), this is its debut on Android. If you do not have an account with access via your employer, it won't do you any good; this is a subscribers-only feature set. </p>
<p> Google Now is genius... most of the time. When you first enable it, it takes a couple of days to get started then it figures out where you live, work, go to the gym, and your other favorite places. Then it starts letting you know how long it'll take you to get to those places depending on the time of day and your previous history of travels to that location. </p>
<p> The problem with Google Now's predictions though is that sometimes they can be inaccurate from the start or take a little longer to adapt to change. Moved your home? Switched jobs? </p>

<p> workaround </p>
<p> YouTube is one of the most popular destinations on the web, and like so many sites out there, funds itself by displaying ads to viewers. While you could easily banish them by paying for YouTube Premium (or going all rogue with an ad-blocker), no workaround is quite as weirdly simple as this method discovered by — who else but a Redditor. </p>
<p> In classic Niantic fashion, the studio has upset fans of one of its games once again, and this time around, the kerfuffle surrounds the Galaxy Store version of Pokémon GO. Apparently, before the update to version 0.157.0 on the Galaxy Store, users could play both the Play Store version of the game in tandem with the Galaxy Store version when using separate accounts, all from the same device. Clearly, this loophole was unintentional, and so was taken advantage of by cheaters by running two apps at the same time, but there was also a legitimate use for families that share devices, which is why so many people are upset with this change. </p>
<p> As we all know, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL use the same camera hardware. But while the Pixel 2 XL hasn't had any major camera issues (at least recently), the Pixel 2 has been having problems with its infinity focus point essentially since launch, leading to blurry panoramas. It's been eight months since the issue was first reported, but because Google still hasn't fixed it, an owner decided to take things into his own hands. </p>
<p> If you've been watching the blogosphere over the last few days, you might have seen an article or two about a "complaint" filed with the FCC over Verizon's block on tethering applications in the Android Market. </p>
<p> The complainant's argument goes something like this: Verizon purchased the 700MHz spectrum ("block C" of the spectrum) back in 2007, and that spectrum is now used by Verizon for its 4G LTE service. That purchase, ala Google and other net neutrality lobbyists, came with one seemingly large caveat: Verizon (or AT&T, or anyone who bought in that spectrum) could not "deny, limit, or restrict" the phones using that spectrum in particular ways: phones must be carrier unlocked, able to access all parts of the web, and run any software. </p>

<p> work chat </p>
<p> Email client? Work chat client? Why not have one app for both? So thinks Ginger Labs — the people behind iOS annotation app Notability — who have come up with a new messaging medium cheekily called Twobird. This metaphorical single stone, which lets users craft notes, to-do lists, spreadsheets, and accumulate replies all on an in-line thread, is now available for early access on the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> If you're one of the select few who work for a company that uses Facebook for Work, then Facebook has just released the messaging app for you. Work Chat is Facebook's take on work-based communication apps like Slack and Hipchat — although it does feel slightly barebones for now. </p>
<p> Work Chat joins Facebook's other work-related app, aptly named Facebook at Work, released back in January. It is pretty much identical to Facebook's regular Messenger app, with the exception that you can only chat with your "work friends." The first version of the app allows users to message coworkers, create work groups, place VoIP calls, and send stickers. </p>

<p> work from home </p>
<p> This year will be remembered for many things, not least of which will be the sudden spike in time most of us will have spent at home. For many, it's the first experience with the work-from-home lifestyle, and all of the ups and downs that come with it — e.g. video conferencing, no commuting, cooking lunch in your own kitchen, having to actually make your own lunch, and so on. If you want to reward yourself for surviving this wacky experience, Dead Zebra has a new Android figurine designed to commemorate the Work From Home warriors, and it's going on sale today. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/04 8:50am PDTon Apr 4, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/29 8:13am PDTon May 29, 2020. </p>
<p> While you'd think that the world's webcam supply chain would have caught up with demand from the many millions of folks working from home by now, you'd be wrong. Logitech is still sold out of every model it makes online, and questionable cheap webcams popping up here and there on Amazon probably aren't a wise investment. But you do have a professional webcam at home, you just may have forgotten about it: your smartphone. With a few simple gadgets, you make your phone into a pro videoconferencing rig in a snap, and be the envy of everyone at the virtual office. </p>

<p> We live in interesting times—most of us are staying home to slow the spread of coronavirus. Many people are also trying to jury-rig a home office to get work done. That might mean you've got devices like laptops, phones, and tablets floating around that need charging, and you probably want to avoid the inevitable tangle of cables. A charging station can come in handy during these trying times, and here are the best ones you can get. </p>
<p> Most of us are spending more time at home these days as we cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Working from home isn't for everyone—it can get monotonous and boring, but some tunes might help. Here are some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers, all of which have quick shipping on Amazon even as the company scales back non-essential deliveries. A few of them are even on sale right now. </p>
<p> Plenty of businesses use Hangouts Meet for person-to-person video calls and conferencing, especially since the company recently made it free for G Suite customers as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. If you're using it at home and struggling with your laptop's built-in webcam or a mediocre microphone, Google just published a list of approved hardware upgrades that have passed the Hangouts Meet hardware peripheral and qualification program. </p>
<p> If you're not already used to it, working from home can be pretty hard, especially if you've got kids around. With school closed and them stuck at home, the same as you, you can't blame them for making a little noise, and that's not mentioning all the other opportunities for distraction. But you can do something about it and keep productivity up while you work to pay the bills. Mpow's H5 Bluetooth headphones have active noise cancellation, and, more importantly, they're just $30 right now at Amazon. </p>

<p> The sensation that is Fortnite landed on Android just two days ago, but it was set to be a Samsung exclusive for a "few days." That nebulously defined period is now over, and the application now runs on non-Samsung devices, but there is a catch: You still can't actually play it unless you got an invite. </p>
<p> The EVO fan blog Good and EVO is reporting that simultaneous voice calling and 3G data (SV-DO) is working on Sprint's HTC EVO 4G LTE. Some of you may be aware that unlike GSM carriers (e.g. AT&T), CDMA carriers (e.g. Sprint) are unable to serve voice and data over 3G simultaneously. So if you were on a CDMA device talking to someone, it would be impossible for you to connect to the internet. Verizon Wireless became one of the first CDMA carriers to offer both voice and data over its 3G networks when it launched the HTC Thunderbolt, early last year. </p>

<p> Google wants to help us stay fit during a time of disrupted routines. That's why the company's Fit team joined forces with YouTube and added a new video feed to the Fit app. You'll find all kinds of health-related content from different creators in it, such as home workouts, meditation routines, and mental wellness tips. </p>
<p> Ever since we've been asked to work from home, I've received a bunch of messages from my friends and coworkers asking me about home workout apps to stay fit. Instead of privately sharing my recommendations with them, I preferred to make them more widely available here. I've chosen ten apps from the Play Store that are highly-rated and can help most people continue to exercise while confined, including cardio, body weight, and high intensity training. </p>
<p> While what feels like half of Europe has already imposed closures and restrictions on non-essentials stores, public spaces, and fitness studios, this phase of the COVID-19 response is only starting in the US. The second largest fitness chain in the country, Fitness 24, has decided to take the step proactively and closed all of its locations Monday, March 16. In order to keep you fit in the meantime, the company offers premium content in its 24GO app free of charge. </p>
<p> There are many fitness tracking apps around to monitor your runs, rides, and other workouts. Over the past few years, several of them have been acquired by athletic apparel and footwear manufacturers, which usually made them part of their overall fitness offering. For instance, Under Amour integrated Map My Fitness and Edomondo into its portfolio, and Asics did the same with Runkeeper. Adidas also went shopping back in 2015, when it bought Runtastic. Two years later, the company shut down its miCoach ecosystem, prompting users to migrate to the newly acquired service. The German brand now pushed the integration further, as it officially renamed Runtastic to Adidas Running. </p>
<p> If you ask my friends what I'm really into, they'll definitely mention fitness. As surprisingly as it sounds, this wasn't the case about ten years ago, until I decided I wanted to lose weight and start training more seriously. I've been able to achieve my goals and understand what I was doing thanks to a bunch of apps, and I wanted to share a some of them with you to help you get in shape or track your objectives in a way that matches your lifestyle. </p>
<p> I've compiled a list of apps with the help of our team, and organized them into categories, as not everybody has the same needs and ambition. </p>
<p> Apple popularized fully cordless audio with its AirPods, but other manufacturers also offer cheaper or better alternatives. A good illustration is Aukey's in-ear buds, which are much more discreet than their counterpart — meaning they don't look like toothbrush heads — and cost $100 less. The below coupons make them $20 cheaper and therefore one of the most affordable products in their category, at just $39.59. </p>
<p> An update to Google Fit began rolling out to both phones and Android Wear this week. In terms of changes, watches took the lead on this release with a short list of fairly significant additions, including audio alerts during runs, updates to the workout mode, a new screen for workout history, and even automatic heart rate tracking for some recent models. While phones weren't left out entirely, the only notable addition is a new app shortcut for handsets running Nougat and above. </p>
<p> A very long-awaited update to Google Fit began rolling out earlier this week, but it seemed to focus almost entirely on improvements to the Wear micro-app while the main app was all but ignored. As it turns out, that was a mistake. A fresh update to the app started rolling out yesterday and it brings the rest of the features that were intended for this release – and what a list of features they are. </p>
<p> Note: Everything here was about to be part of a teardown, but the update stole that thunder. </p>
<p> It's been a while since we've seen a true update to Google Fit – about 6 months if you don't count a version that turned up in the final M Developer Preview. You might even say the app got a bit flabby over the summer. (Sorry.) The latest version began rolling out yesterday and it's featuring a couple of big changes for Android Wear, including a brand new watch face and a trainer mode to help you get in shape. The main app also went through a couple of changes, but they're nothing to get excited about. However, check back later for a pretty big teardown – some big things are happening. </p>

<p> workout headphones </p>
<p> Along with three new true wireless earbuds, Plantronics introduced last month a new over-ear headphone model. The BackBeat Fit 6100 offer a unique proposition for gym goers and workout aficionados who don't like in-ear buds: they're over-ear cans made specifically to withstand sweat and exercise, but they suit your commuter lifestyle or desk job just as well. The $180 price is on the high side, though. </p>
<p> If you work out a lot like I do, you know how important it is to have the right headphones during your session. I've learned that the hard way: Five years ago when I started lifting, I would use the cheap earphones that came with my handset, but I quickly gave up because the wires would get caught in different things or an earpiece would fail in the middle of a workout. They eventually drowned in my sweat and died, so I decided to get a pair of wireless earphones especially designed for athletes that cost me about $180 back then. </p>

<p> Workout Mix </p>
<p> YouTube Music is due to become Google's only music service by the end of this year. In anticipation of taking the spotlight, the platform has been rapidly adding features and making tweaks lately, such as the ability to swipe between tracks and start playback directly from the album art. Last month, four new Mix playlists were spotted in the wild, and now it looks like those are becoming more widely available. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/20 2:50pm PDTon May 20, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/16 10:55am PDTon Jun 16, 2020. </p>
<p> YouTube Music already has a few Spotify-like dynamic "Mix" playlists, but more might be coming in the future. A new (but, sadly, non-functional) "Focus Mix" playlist has been spotted in the wild, plus a "related" tab loaded with similar artists and other music nestled inside the new pull-out section now-playing interface. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/workout-tracking/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549815" filename="workout-tracking">
<p> An update to Google Fit began rolling out to both phones and Android Wear this week. In terms of changes, watches took the lead on this release with a short list of fairly significant additions, including audio alerts during runs, updates to the workout mode, a new screen for workout history, and even automatic heart rate tracking for some recent models. While phones weren't left out entirely, the only notable addition is a new app shortcut for handsets running Nougat and above. </p>
<p> A very long-awaited update to Google Fit began rolling out earlier this week, but it seemed to focus almost entirely on improvements to the Wear micro-app while the main app was all but ignored. As it turns out, that was a mistake. A fresh update to the app started rolling out yesterday and it brings the rest of the features that were intended for this release – and what a list of features they are. </p>
<p> Note: Everything here was about to be part of a teardown, but the update stole that thunder. </p>
<p> It's been a while since we've seen a true update to Google Fit – about 6 months if you don't count a version that turned up in the final M Developer Preview. You might even say the app got a bit flabby over the summer. (Sorry.) The latest version began rolling out yesterday and it's featuring a couple of big changes for Android Wear, including a brand new watch face and a trainer mode to help you get in shape. The main app also went through a couple of changes, but they're nothing to get excited about. However, check back later for a pretty big teardown – some big things are happening. </p>
<p> I had my eyes on Amiigo the moment it was mentioned here on Android Police back in January 2013. The promised features seemed like everything I wanted in an all-day sleep and activity tracker, especially with its waterproof design and swimming capability. See, runners and cyclists have it easy: there are dozens if not hundreds of gadgets they have been able to use for the past years to track their workouts. But swimmers, well, let's just say the choice has always been limited and it was even more so in 2013 when you wanted a smart tracker that synced with Android. </p>

<p> workplace by facebook </p>
<p> Over a year ago, Facebook began testing their internal communication tool, Facebook at Work, with a number of organizations. Not only has Facebook renamed the platform to 'Workplace by Facebook,' they are finally publicly releasing it. Starting today, any company can use Workplace. </p>
<p> In the same vein as Google+ for Work, Workplace tries to adapt social networks for internal use at businesses. Facebook's news feed, search, trending posts, live video, and more have all made the jump. Workplace also features unlimited file, photo, and video storage, monitoring tools, team and project groups, and Single-sign on (SSO) support. Integration with G Suite (the new name for Google Apps for Work), Okta, OneLogin, Ping, and Windows Azure AD is also supported. </p>

<p> workshop </p>
<p> Way back in August of 2014, we got a peek at a service Google was experimenting with, at the time called "Workshop." The service would allow users to create customized cases for their Nexus 5, featuring either photos or map imagery of their choice. The cases would come with a special live wallpaper, also customized around the user's preferences. </p>
<p> After that post, though, everything was quiet. We didn't hear or see any new motion on Workshop until last month, when a customized Google Maps case popped up on a Googler's Google+ profile. </p>
<p> Google hasn't exactly had a spotless track record when it comes to official Nexus accessories. Accessories have been teased or shown off only to arrive months later or not at all (remember that Nexus 10 dock?). </p>
<p> Recently, though, Google has done a much better job - there are a bevy of case options available for both the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 (2013) in a variety of colors, catering to almost all tastes (though at times the quality may not be ideal). </p>

<p> workshops </p>
<p> The folks over at Droid-life have unearthed an internal Verizon document pointing to some device workshops for two as-of-yet unknown devices. The LG Cayman (like the islands, but way smaller), and the DROID Fighter. No word yet on which manufacturer is producing the latter. </p>
<p> We're not sure whether the "device workshops" are public or employee training. We also don't know if they take place before or after the release of the devices. </p>
<p> While this app may not be useful to everyone out there, the concept is still pretty cool and could be quite useful for those who handle event management, ticket tracking, workshops, etc. </p>
<p> So, what is Eventbrite? It's a service that allows you to create and manage events, sell tickets, and keep track of attendees. The Eventbrite Easy Entry Android app is a key part of the service, as it allows you to scan the QR codes from tickets, essentially keeping up with who is there. </p>

<p> workspace </p>
<p> Google's suite of office products are already pretty handy on their own, but with add-ons in the mix, things can get even better. Introduced for Gmail back in 2017, add-ons allow for integrations between popular third-party services and Google's own apps. Now these types of add-ons should be available on Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, too. </p>
<p> Google Workspace is replacing G Suite, and anyone interested in the new features can sign up or switch over to the service right now (unless they're managing an Education or Non-profit organization). But if you're one of the many people relying on G Suite's $12/month unlimited storage "hack," you might be better off sticking to your current G Suite plan — if you want unlimited storage on the new Workspace tiers, it will cost you at least $20 a month. </p>
<p> Google Drive is the place to save your files and collaborate on them. If you're anything like me, however, your data will clutter until the place looks like it's been hit by a bomb. Luckily, Google knows us and is adding a Priority page to Drive that will show you the documents it thinks are the most relevant to you right now. </p>
<p> Friday evening brought us another update to the Google app. Unlike the previous version, there are a fair number of topics to discuss from a teardown. Google is preparing a screen for viewing your image searches from Lens, Collection sharing, a few changes to the layout of settings, and there are even hints of a mystery feature named Workspaces. </p>
<p> Every week, I examine somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred app updates while looking for changes. The most interesting things turn into APK Teardowns or Download posts. Many of the remaining updates are unremarkable, amounting to a few bug fixes, routine updates to libraries, or even just pixel-level adjustments to layouts and images. However, there are usually a few updates that land somewhere in between. I don't want to spam readers with dozens of short posts, but I hate to ignore things that people might want to know about, so I'm going to wrap up the leftovers for a little weekend reading and call it Update Notes. </p>

<p> Works with Google Assistant </p>
<p> When Google decided to deprecate its Works with Nest API, there was a litany of questions left behind of what would happen. Some of those answers came when third parties started sending notices to Nest product owners saying that their apps and routines would not work with their cameras, thermostats, and other appliances past August 31 (or earlier). At the same time, as Nest account holders begrudgingly move their roots to a Google account, there are questions as to if all the Works with Nest integrations will be carried over. Google has come back today with answers. </p>
<p> If you ask my neighbors, they'll probably tell you they've heard me shout "OK Google; I'm leaving" at least once. This isn't because I like everybody to know I'm headed out, but rather to turn every smart device off using Assistant. You could argue that since I'm carrying my phone with me, I could set up a routine that does it for me, but I would need to do that for every single app that can control my IoT objects, and I'm not comfortable sharing my location with some of these companies. Lastly, not all of my smart plugs work with IFTTT, so that's not an option either. </p>

<p> Google purchased smart home accessory-maker Nest back in 2014. It announced tighter integration of the brand into its hardware division at Google I/O this year, including the rebranding of the Google Home Hub as Google Nest Hub and the announcement of the new, larger Nest Hub Max. That newfound closeness is coming at a cost, though: Nest accounts are migrating to Google accounts, and the company is retiring the Works with Nest API, consequently breaking direct IFTTT integration with Nest products. </p>

<p> Google quickly cracked down on apps claiming to help diagnose or detect the COVID-19 coronavirus, except those verified to come from health agencies. Now the World Health Organization (WHO) has published an Android app for COVID-19, designed to offer basic safety guidance and provide up-to-date news. </p>
<p> In regular times, social media is crucial in helping us stay in touch with relatives and catch up on some news. Its role has been massively amplified these days, as the world faces one of the biggest challenges we've seen in recent times. But you need to keep in mind that not everything you see online is right, and not everyone knows that fact. WhatsApp understands the role it plays in information propagation and is adding two features to keep everyone properly educated and help them spot wrong stories and facts. </p>

<p> world of goo </p>
<p> In 1961 a musical called How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying made light of the growing corporate culture in America. Half a century later, those same corporations are seen by many as a necessary evil, a soulless machine that runs on the lives of its employees. It's appropriate, then, that Human Resource Machine is more or less the opposite of How To Succeed in Business: instead of starting in the mailroom and becoming the CEO in a fun-filled week of singing and dancing, you play a literal human machine whose behavior is programmed like a computer, and who spends decades in service to a company that has nothing but contempt for you. </p>
<p> Today, the folks behind the immensely popular Humble Bundle announced a few new games for the third edition of its Android package deal. Four new titles have been added for previous or future customers who pay more than the average (which, as of this writing, is sitting at $6.14). The new entries are Anomaly: Warzone Earth, EDGE, Osmos, and the crowd-favorite World of Goo, which, together, cost about $15 on the Play Store. </p>
<p> These four new arrivals come in addition to the previous set of games—including Spirits, which we reviewed earlier—bringing the total number of indie titles you can get to nine, for a mere six bucks and some change. </p>
<p> One of the great things about Android's ecosystem is the number of indie developers who are able to enter the market successfully, providing a great product and inspiring would-be developers to join in. For many though, Android development in general is a mysterious topic. How an app or game goes from an idea to an entry in the Play Store is unknown, but (thankfully) not unknowable. </p>
<p> Of course, considering how major development studios bring apps to life doesn't require too much thought – major companies like EA, Disney, or Rockstar have no problem hiring designers and developers to crank out and maintain polished apps. </p>
<p> Show of hands, Verizon users: who's excited to shell out another six bucks a month to Big Red? Verizon and its new partner Extent hope that you are. Today they've introduced the GameTanium Mobile subscription-based service exclusively for Verizon's customers, bringing "more than 100 of the best Android smartphone games and more than 50 tablet games" to subscribers. The fee will show up on customers' phone bill every month, but Verizon has generously offered a three day trial. </p>
<p> Scoff if you must (and I can hear plenty of our readers winding up already) but on the surface it's a decent deal, assuming that you want to play all of the titles being offered. </p>
<p> To celebrate the launch of Google Play (and the death of the Market brand) and thank developers and Android users across the world, Google has launched a brand-new sale promotion for a number of features apps and games called "Play Our Favorites." </p>
<p> Here's a link (limited to certain countries only, sorry guys). So far, the included apps are: </p>
<p> The Humble Bundle has been around for a couple of years now, but I have never heard of it. They're known for bundling up indie games, letting purchasers set their own price, and dividing up the profits among developers and charities. This is just an absolutely fascinating concept, and the first ever Android bundle has arrived! </p>
<p> The games in this Android bundle include Anomaly Warzone Earth HD (our review), Osmos HD (our review), Edge, and World of Goo. What's even more awesome is the fact that these games are not only DRM free (so you can download them as many times as you want), but they are also cross-platform. </p>
<p> Last month, we got word that popular game World of Goo would be making its way to Android, and that day has finally arrived. </p>
<p> For those unfamiliar with the title, you command tiny living balls of goo, using them to build structures, bridges, and whatever else you can think of to achieve the end goal: reach the exit. This game is insanely popular on iOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, and Wii, and looks absolutely beautiful on Android. Take a peek at the trailer: </p>
<p> The obligatory screenshots: </p>
<p> The game will set you back $2.99, but if you want to give it a go before dropping any dough, there is also a free trial. </p>
<p> , by indie developer 2D Boy, is a highly addictive physics-based puzzle/construction game that has won several design and gaming awards since its release. The basic objective of the game is to get a requisite number of goo balls to a pipe, which represents the exit. The goo balls can be used to make bridges, towers, and other structures to overcome gravity and terrain. Currently, the game is available on a number of platforms, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, and Wii; and earlier today 2D Boy announced that the game would finally be coming to Android tablets and smartphones "soon." </p>

<p> BoyGeniusReport just got a nice clear photo of the HTC Merge, a device we may or may not have seen pass through the FCC with a red keyboard, better known as the dual-mode QWERTY slider for Verizon. The phone appears to be running Sense, and is now rocking a rather svelte brushed-metal style keyboard - one with a markedly different layout to the G2. </p>
<p> It’s difficult to keep track of all the leaked device names out there, we know, but if you can cast your mind back a month or so you may remember the mysterious HTC Lexikon and HTC Bee phones whose details were sourced from the 911sniper blog. Well, the same guys over in China have just posted what is believed to be a copy of the Lexikon’s operating system, complete with “VERIZON” in the filename, and a render of the phone to keep you hooked. </p>

<p> world’s largest camera hump </p>
<p> It's high speculation season for the upcoming OnePlus 7T, what we expect will be the company's first globally-available 5G phone. And, just as with a lot of other phones at this stage, photorealistic renders and 3D models have been commissioned from Steve Hemmerstoffer of @OnLeaks by Indian publication Pricebaba. </p>
<p> SamMobile published an image this afternoon that really kind of explains itself: this is, purportedly, the Galaxy S4 Zoom. The concept is obviously pretty simple - it's a Samsung smartphone with a big-ass camera mounted on the back. Don't get your hopes too far up on the smartphone aspect, though, as even SamMobile is tempering expectations on the specifications. Allegedly, the S4 Zoom will be packing a 4.3" qHD display, dual-core 1.6GHz processor (likely a Qualcomm chip), 8GB of internal storage (with microSD slot, of course), and Android 4.2.2. </p>
<p> So, essentially, this is more like a Galaxy S4 Mini that has had aforementioned freakishly large camera module attached to it. </p>

<p> If there is a parallel universe in which World War 2 didn't occur, I'd bet there are far fewer games there. Well, like it or not Hills of Glory 3D is a WWII-themed title that's part strategy and part "castle defense." On the upside, it's pretty enjoyable. </p>
<p> This is a follow up to the original Hills of Glory, but this time with a whole extra dimension. The graphics are clean and cartoon-y – it actually looks surprisingly good for only being a 49MB download. </p>
<p> Popular Android game developer HandyGames has released a sequel to its well received Guns'n'Glory tower defence game called Guns'n'Glory WW2. The original Guns'n'Glory was a Wild West themed game that put you in charge of mobile units which you had to place in strategic position in order to ambush settlers, stagecoaches and "the gold train". The original game took the concept of a tower defence game and put an intriguing spin on it by allowing the enemy units to fight back. </p>

<p> We've already run down the five best things about the Galaxy S20 Ultra, so now it's time to look at the ways in which it disappoints. It's not unreasonable to expect a $1,400 phone to be damn near perfect, but the S20 Ultra sadly has a few negatives points that bring its overall score down. You can check out our full review to see what Ryan thought about it, but here's a summary of the least appealing aspects of the S20 Ultra. </p>
<p> There's a lot to like about the OnePlus 6. It looks great, its got that genius alert slider, and it charges really fast. It isn't perfect, though; to hit an appropriately OnePlus price point, some corners invariably must be cut. Last month, we shared with you six things we liked about the OnePlus 6. Now, here are five things we don't. </p>
<p> 2011 was a great year for Android - Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich was announced. The Galaxy Nexus was released. A whole truckload of Android tablets came out. The first 4G LTE smartphones appeared. But there were some significant speed bumps as well. Here are, in no particular order, the five things in the world of Android in the last year that really got our hopes up, but ended up being a little disappointing. </p>
<p> 1. HTC ThunderBolt / All Early Verizon 4G LTE Phones </p>
<p> It's really hard to know where to start with the ThunderBolt. It wasn't actually a terrible phone in terms of usability or performance, but the delayed release, abysmal battery life, overheating, and seemingly endless wait for Android 2.3 drew more angst from owners than probably any other device we've ever seen. </p>
<p> The upcoming 3D phone from LG, Optimus 3D, may be cool, with its glasses-free 3D and a dual-core CPU, but it certainly didn't stop the company from producing one of the cheesiest/worst commercials we've ever seen. </p>
<p> The premise is decent - a girl is doing yoga, and her 3D-capable phone provides her with 3D training videos, but the execution... well, you decide, because I'm out of words: </p>

<p> Sony first introduced Aibo, its robotic puppy toy, in 1999. It was discontinued in 2006. Then, last November, Aibo made a comeback in Japan, updated with modern trimmings like Wi-Fi connectivity and location mapping. The new model cost 198,000 yen (about $1,800), plus an additional 90,000 yen (about $800) for a three-year subscription to a cloud service. Now, Aibo is coming to America in a $2,899 "Limited First Litter Edition Release" that includes the robo-puppy itself, a subscription to the requisite cloud service, and some bonus items. </p>
<p> There have been more than a few attempts at making portable projectors tiny enough to fit in your pocket, with the InstaShare Moto Mod being one of the latest. Sony apparently wants to give it a shot, as it announced the MP-CD1 mobile projector earlier today. </p>

<p> I want to ask everyone a question - well, everyone who owns an Android tablet, that is - how often do you instinctively reach for it, as opposed to your phone or laptop? I don't care what the reason is, I'm just genuinely curious how much of a "tweener" role your Android tablet has taken in your life. And after you read this editorial, share that story with me in the comments, because I'd really like to have a discussion with people on this. </p>
<p> It certainly seems like it. Yesterday, Microsoft announced via blog that it had concluded negotiations with Samsung and reached a licensing deal for the same seven patents it previously licensed to HTC for Android (along with other, smaller Android manufacturers). There were rumblings about just what royalty rate Samsung is paying, but the guess is anywhere from $5 to $15 per handset (it's likely on a percentage-of-MSRP basis - so think about 1-3% per $500 MSRP phone). </p>
<p> For every Windows Phone 7-inspired app, launcher, or theme we've written about, a half-dozen more, often clones, go unmentioned. But every now and then we find something we haven't seen before, and this is one of those times. It's called WP7Contacts, and as you would surmise, it's a contact manager inspired by Windows Phone 7. </p>
<p> It's official: Nokia and Microsoft have formed a strategic alliance. Which, in layman's terms, means Nokia smartphones will be powered by Windows Phone 7, and search across all Nokia devices will be powered by Bing. What does this mean for Android, though? </p>
<p> Well, who knows. On the one hand, this is a move by Nokia to try to stop hemorrhaging customers, especially from the highly profitable smartphone segment. </p>

<p> WPA </p>
<p> According to a tipster at Droid-life, the Motorola XOOM will be receiving a (relatively minor) system update tomorrow, and no - it doesn't include SD card support (exactly why, we can't even begin to guess). Here's the list of changes and additions: </p>
<p> Access and stay connected to Wi-Fi networks with added Proxy support </p>
<p> SSL data transfer with websites is now supported </p>
<p> WPA Pre-Shared Key pass-phrases are now supported when using the device as a Mobile Hotspot </p>
<p> POP 3 HTML emails will display in their entirety </p>
<p> Bluetooth is now supported in Google Talk </p>
<p> Application storage errors will not appear unless the device has reached maximum storage capacity </p>
<p> Safely dock the Motorola XOOM into the docking adapter without interruption </p>
<p> Ability to add and use a Bluetooth mouse </p>
<p> View and import pictures from digital cameras with Picture Transfer Protocol </p>
<p> When using the device in accessibility mode, menus will no longer prompt with sounds </p>
<p> Generally, this update seems to fix a lot of bugs and add support for some more technical items - nothing to get too worked up about. </p>
<p> Only 5 days ago the brilliant team behind the android-wifi-tether project, which provides free WiFi hotspot capabilities to rooted phones, added support for EVO 4G. This meant users of this recently released beast could now turn their phones into WiFi routers, broadcasting WiFi signal to devices nearby, thus removing the need for a similar application Sprint charges $30/month for. </p>
<p> Well, there were a couple of limitations: </p>
<p> The android-wifi-tether hotspot ran in ad-hoc mode, which meant devices that didn't support ad-hoc mode couldn't use or even see it. </p>

<p> These days, most people connect to the internet via Wi-Fi. We've been taught that on unprotected, open hotspots, you can easily be followed around the web, but generally, we would assume that password-protected networks are relatively safe from outside attacks. As it turns out, a vulnerability in the widely used Wi-Fi protected access 2 (WPA2) protocol lets hackers view unencrypted connections on these networks, even if they don't know the password. Patches are already rolling out to current routers and client devices, leaving only older, unsupported hardware indefinitely affected. </p>
<p> The Wi-Fi Alliance has announced additional measures to secure wireless devices, following revelations last year about an oversight in the WPA2 specification which left devices vulnerable. </p>
<p> If you read any tech websites besides Android Police, you may have already heard about 'KRACK.' That's the name for a serious security vulnerability that affects virtually every device supporting Wi-Fi connections - including Android. </p>

<p> wpa3 </p>
<p> CES 2020 gave the networking device market a solid head start for the rest of the year. We not only saw a more capable Wi-Fi standard come into being but also mainstream brands jumping in with a pile of new routers and mesh systems. Besides an expanded security camera lineup, D-Link’s CES announcement includes a long list of routers and range extenders that integrate the EasyMesh and Wi-Fi 6 standard. </p>
<p> With the launch of Nest Wifi, we've learned that this new mesh system is backward-compatible with the existing Google Wifi, but if you're happy with your setup and have no plans to get a new Nest router or access point, you can still get a little benefit out of adding your old Wifi to the Google Home app. That lets you manage a few things from a central location and adds WPA3 security to the Wifis. </p>
<p> The vast majority of people out there don't know much about network security, if at all, but thankfully there are talented groups and individuals out there who are on constant lookout for flaws and vulnerabilities. Each security protocol we've seen has had some kind of issue (sometimes crippling), but the still-young Wi-Fi Protected Access protocol version 3, aka WPA3, remains vulnerable to attack, thanks to some pretty serious design flaws. </p>
<p> We're likely a couple of months away from the first developer preview build of Android Q, but already we know a fair amount about what to expect from the next major version. Most excitingly, we could be finally getting a system-wide dark mode. We can now say with a greater degree of certainty that Android Q will carry the version number 10, plus we've learned a few more tidbits. </p>

<p> wps </p>
<p> Wi-Fi Protected Setup authentication, or WPS for short, disappeared from Android 9 Pie in an intentional move by Google due to security concerns, although it then promised that the feature would return in a future Android release, although perhaps in a slightly different form. Instead, Android Q supports a similar technology called Wi-Fi Easy Connect. </p>
<p> It was recently pointed out to us that Android P lacks support for the Wi-Fi Protected Setup authentication mode. WPS, as its known, is a protocol that allows a client Wi-Fi device to connect to a router using a PIN or a push-button and is widely regarded as being deeply insecure. In short, the PIN-based method for authentication is inherently crackable with a brute force attack, and the PIN mode is required to be enabled by default on routers with WPS support, making using WPS at all a Very Bad Idea. </p>
<p> Kingsoft, makers of the popular productivity app Kingsoft Office, today announced that the Android app has reached 210 million users around the world. To mark the event, the app has been rebranded to WPS Office and given a new icon to match. The announcement comes on the heels of the app's update to version 6.0, which introduces "over 100 feature updates and enhancements," including a revitalized interface, support for 44 languages, and - in Kingsoft's words - "much more." </p>
<p> The app can view, create, and share office documents on any Android device running 2.1+, and offers collaboration features like edit tracking and comments. </p>

<p> wreck-it ralph </p>
<p> The Play Store is filled with great games to cram onto your mobile device, but there's another Android marketplace you may have forgotten to check. Don't worry, I have your back. Amazon is currently offering eight free games as part of today's Game Pack. If you throw in the usual free app of the day, that actually makes nine games you can get just by hitting up Amazon before the day is up. </p>
<p> Earlier this morning, something strange happened. A handful of paid Disney games – including Where's My Water?, Temple Run: Brave, and Wreck-it Ralph, among others – suddenly showed up as free in the Play Store. Naturally, stories started popping up in the Android world that a bunch of fairly popular games were suddenly available without charge for no apparent reason. Perhaps Disney decided that it was time to give some titles away – but that didn't make much sense, as the "lite" versions of most titles were still present alongside their formerly-paid counterparts. </p>
<p> As gamers, we've all become familiar with the tie-in title. These are usually released in conjunction with a movie or TV show to widen its exposure, and historically they're usually pretty sub-par. </p>
<p> However, Disney's Wreck-It Ralph subverts this trope because it's in the unique position of being based off of video games. That's kind of hard to mess up. </p>
<p> Wreck-It Ralph is a series of three (soon to be four) arcade games that feature characters and environments from the movie. </p>
<p> Wreck-It Ralph's a nice guy. But he's also a bad guy. So he's a bad nice guy. Or a nice bad guy. Either way, he's tired of being a bad guy, so he wants to be a nice good guy. But in the world of video games, every action title needs an antagonist. And that's Ralph's job - until he abandons his game to search for a new place where he doesn't have to be a bad guy. </p>

<p> wrestling </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a delightful 2D Metroidvania title, a unique chatroom adventure game, a gorgeous puzzle game that the entire family can enjoy, a unique sensory deprivation game, a casual arcade game where you get to put your wrestling skills to the test, and a new pinball collection game from Zen Studios. Without </p>
<p> Okay, TV viewers. If you like watching overly muscle-y men and women wear skimpy clothing and ridiculous outfits while they fondle each other angrily, listen up. The WWE Network app is now out for Android TV. </p>
<p> This Android app lets you view all of the programming you would expect from the network. This means live feeds and on-demand content, including the substantial archive of angry flesh-on-flesh action from decades of WWE, ECW, and WCW. You also get access to all pay-per-views as they happen. Then there's the behind the scenes footage that fleshes out just who these deep, complex actors really are—or kind of are. </p>
<p> If you're tired of pretending that The Rock is a literal golem or playing the trading card version of wrestling, then the WWE is ready to deliver a (slightly) less fictional experience to hungry gamers. WWE 2K (that's the publisher 2K, not the year 2000) takes the familiar 3D fighting formula from decades of console wrestling games and shrinks it down into a mobile title. Even more impressive is the price: a single dollar with no in-app purchases in sight, at least for the moment. </p>
<p> You would think that professional wrestlers don't need an active fantasy life. They get paid huge amounts of money to pretend to beat people up and show off unbelievable physiques on television on a regular basis. But I suppose even wrestlers like to pretend that they're superheroes (the ones that aren't already superheroes, anyway). If you'd like to play along, Warner Bros and developer NetherRealm are here with an officially-licensed WWE fighting game that dials up the more fantastic elements of pro wrestling. </p>
<p> In WWE Immortals, The Rock is a golem who likes to clobber things. Triple H is a Conan-style barbarian. </p>
<p> The Magic-style collectible card game has remained one of the most consistently profitable free-to-play genres on mobile devices. That might explain why every hot-ticket property from Star Wars to Tekken wants in on the action. The latest slightly baffling addition to the pile of CCG titles comes from the World Wrestling Federation Entertainment. Feast your eyes on WWE SuperCard, a game that forces big, burly actors to fight each other with tiny scraps of cardboard instead of fake punches. </p>
<p> But wait a second, this game isn't just spawning Frank The Steroid Abuser into the ring when you play his card. </p>
<p> Like all red-blooded American males, I spend my days sitting around thinking, "Man, I sure wish I could play a button-masher fighting game on my phone staring the one and only Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson." Today my prayers were answered in a totally extreme way. WWE has released Rockpocalypse, with The Rock himself punching and kicking his way through 18 levels of pain. Did I mention it's extreme? EXTREME! </p>
<p> This isn't a wrestling game, despite being published by WWE. The premise is that The Rock is on the set of his new movie (a chart-topping blockbuster, I'm sure) when suddenly everyone on the studio lot starts changing into a raving lunatic bent on destroying The Rock. </p>
<p> Before I get this post underway, I'd like to send my condolences to the family of "Macho Man" Randy Savage, who had passed away 2 days ago. Wrestling is a guilty pleasure of mine, and his rambling promos about the Danger Zone will always have a special place in my heart. RIP Randy. </p>
<p> The Game </p>
<p> A lot of my youth was spent playing the Smackdown series of games on the PS2; I still pop in Here Comes the Pain every now and again to relive the glory of throwing someone off the top of a ladder through a table. These games, with their arcade-y mechanics and campy story modes, were kings of replayability: if you got bored with your current roster of brawlers, you could just create a bunch more and suddenly the game was new again. </p>

<p> wristband </p>
<p> Sony, LG, and Razer all announced fitness bands at this year's CES, but we shouldn't let this distract us from the options already on the market. The Jawbone Up app has been available on Google Play for quite some time, and now the company is bringing support for its newer Up24 band to Android via an app update. </p>
<p> We're well into the holiday season here in the US, and I know new electronics aren't the only things many of you have picked up lately. If you have some new pounds you're looking to shave, Best Buy has a deal that may just make doing so a little bit easier - or at least more fun. The Fitbit Flex fitness bracelet is currently on sale for $79.99, a savings of $20 from its usual price. </p>
<p> When Jawbone's UP wristband was released in late 2011, I was excited. Then I was disappointed. The motion-tracking band seemed like a perfect step into wearable tech at the time, but its companion app wasn't available for Android. Whether and why Jawbone didn't see fit to invest resources in developing for Android was a mystery, but now – thankfully – it's immaterial. Just over a week ago, Jawbone released an official UP app to the Google Play Store, and I wanted to be first in line to try it out with Jawbone's updated 2012 wristband. </p>
<p> Did you enter 2013 with visions of eating healthily, becoming more active, and staying fit? Not so easy a few months down the line, is it? The good news is that Jawbone may have just provided you with that extra boost that you needed, as the UP app is finally available for Android. </p>
<p> On the surface, the Jawbone UP wristband is comparable to the Nike+ Fuelband, although with the app in tow it allows you to take a more holistic view, tracking your sleep patterns, looking at how you eat every day, and how much exercise you do. </p>

<p> writing </p>
<p> Repeating the same words makes for sub-par writing, which is why most authors employ synonyms to diversify the vocabulary they use. Even though writing is usually done on computers, a lot of it happens on our mobiles, and finding synonyms should be as simple as when you're working on your laptop. Thankfully, Grammarly's keyboard can now suggest analog words as you type, so your messages can be more remarkable than ever. </p>
<p> I have been trying to write about Medium's 2.0 update for a few hours, but I got lost using the app, enjoying it, and I even decided to sign up and write one of my first non-Android stories in years. That's how you know the app is not just good, it's great. I have always thought about joining Medium, but I never felt compelled to. I guess this update was the final push I needed, and I decided to pull the trigger and dive deep in the service. </p>
<p> But let's get back to Medium's update. You may recall that the app was released mere months ago, but it has seen a steady stream of improvements since then. </p>
<p> Do you long for the simpler days of pen and paper? Do you need direct pen input to your tablet or phone for drawing or equations? Do you just want a really nifty folio case to make all the other board members jealous at the next meeting? In all three cases, Wacom has you covered. The famous graphics tablet company is branching further into mobile accessories with the Bamboo Paper, a folio that combines some impressive technology to let you write on standard paper and save your work digitally to Android or iOS. </p>
<p> Here's how it works. The Spark includes a specialized Bluetooth-enabled pen, but it's writing in old-fashioned ink - there's no stylus, powered or otherwise, in the package. </p>
<p> I love JotterPad. I've said it before, but I thought I'd preface with this disclaimer and then convince you why you should love it too. I'm not in the business of coercing anyone, but I think we'd all be better off if we did more writing, be it regular note taking, prose, poetry, journaling, or anything that involves putting a series of words in an order that makes sense with a decent serving of imagery and correct grammar sprinkled on top. </p>
<p> If words are your passion too, then you'll be happy to know that JotterPad X dumped its Roman numeral and got a kick up to JotterPad 11. </p>
<p> You probably know Squarespace as a paid what-you-see-is-what-you-get website creator, which is the main focus of the product. But the company has been working on a few mobile apps as of late, and today two of them are available on Android. Well, they were available before, but now you can use them without having to go through the somewhat convoluted Google+ beta community system. Meet Squarespace Blog and Squarespace Note. </p>
<p> Blog is basically Squarespace's oh-so-pretty version of the official WordPress app. It lets you log into any Squarespace account or site to add textual posts or edit the ones you've already completed. </p>
<p> Traditionally word processors have tasked themselves with producing nice, printable documents. Mobile versions have followed up with the unenviable task of replicating this functionality on much smaller screens. Quip throws this entire concept out of the window, instead creating a writing experience built for the ground up for mobile devices. The team released an alpha version over the summer, but it was little more than a demo of the iOS version of the app. Now the full version is available, and it looks right at home on Android devices. </p>
<p> I'm going to be really honest about this one: I had no idea that anyone still uses LiveJournal. Much to my surprise, though, it has been going strong all this time - it's even ranked #71 in the world according to Alexa. After realizing that tidbit of information, it's not surprising at all that there is now an official LiveJournal App for Android. </p>
<p> For a mobile blogging app, I must say that this one seems quite feature rich: you can post new journal entries and photos, create polls, edit entries, create drafts, and manage settings. From just a quick look, I think that this may be the best on-the-go blogging app that I've seen thus far. </p>
<p> When Gingerbread was launched back in December of last year, we learned that one of its main selling points was Near Field Communication (NFC) support, which allowed for NFC-enabled devices to communicate when placed near each other. </p>
<p> Using your Android phone as a credit card or sharing information by bringing 2 devices close to each other seemed like a dream come true until we found that NFC support in Gingerbread was actually quite limited - writing/transmitting was not possible and only a limited subset of reading APIs was available. </p>
<p> Today, Google announced a new Gingerbread update bearing version number 2.3.3. The update is concentrated mostly around NFC, introducing writing/transmitting APIs and support for a wider range of NFC standards. </p>

<p> WSJ </p>
<p> Nintendo is reportedly encouraging its smartphone game development partners to focus on fun instead of maximum revenue. It would appear that Nintendo sees the smartphone gaming market as a way to increase interest in its properties with the hope that its smartphone customers will find their way to the console market, the company's bread and butter. </p>
<p> A possible merger between T-Mobile and Sprint has been a topic of discussion and rumors for years. Last month, it was revealed that the two companies were (again) in talks of a merger, with T-Mobile's parent company Deutsche Telekom having majority ownership of the new carrier. </p>
<p> The Wall Street Journal has just released a new Android app called WSJ AR. It is an augmented reality app that allows you to navigate a visualization of the US stock market via your Tango phone. In addition to overall market representations, you can zoom in to look at individual stock details, view headlines related to the selected stock, and save your favorites. </p>
<p> Quite a lot of us have done away with the landline telephones that used to be a staple of homes in the developed world. A 2013 survey concluded that over 40% of US households had ditched their standard landlines phones, driven by younger users relying exclusively on their cell phones. But according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, both Google and Amazon are looking to revive the landline (well, VOIP line anyway) as a bonus feature in their voice-controlled Wi-Fi speakers, the Google Home and Amazon Echo/Tap/Echo Dot. </p>
<p> Google, for all its skill in the realms of mobile search, advertising, email, and even operating systems, has never been particularly good at the social thing. Even now, I suspect, someone at Google is fuming at the notion that the company "isn't very good" at messaging or social networks and pointing animatedly at the tens of millions of Google+ and Hangouts users. The problem is and has always been that for whatever success Google has had in social and messaging platforms, it is constantly undercut by the actions of Google itself that say otherwise. There is near-yearly reworking, redesigning, or branching off of these products in ways that very strongly suggest they aren't getting the results Google's Alphabet overlords consider acceptable. </p>
<p> According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is working on a few things. They are, according to the world's most infamous tipster "People Familiar With The Matter," working on an Android-powered video game console. And a smart watch. And a new Nexus Q. And the possibility of Android-powered appliances (like refrigerators). And Laptops. And, oh yeah, low-cost phones for developing markets. </p>
<p> Typically we avoid reporting on too-good-to-be-true rumors, but today's alleged revelation is a real whopper. Since it comes from the Wall Street Journal – which often comes through on rumors – it might just be worth keeping an eye on. </p>
<p> If you thought Google Fiber sounded like a game changer, you may want to keep an eye on this story. According to the Wall Street Journal, which has a history of having well-placed sources, Google has held talks with Dish Network discussing the possibility of partnering on a wireless carrier to compete with AT&T, Verizon, and all the rest. At first, it sounds like a pipe dream. The kind we've been hoping for since the G1. Thing is, this time, it has a shot of not being complete bupkis. </p>
<p> Before we get into why this might be true, though, let's take a look at why it might be false: for starters, according to WSJ's own sources, the talks are not very advanced and "could amount to nothing." </p>
<p> The rumor mill giveth and the rumor mill taketh away. Late Sunday night, a commenter on our site posted a surprising confession: he was the source of several rumors regarding Android 4.2. Initially, we confirmed that this commenter was the same who had sent us some different yet equally fantastic stories. Our batch hinted that Robert Downey Jr. might have been hired to introduce the new Nexii for the next couple years, for example. Now, Android & Me has posted a retraction of the initial article stating that Android 4.2 would contain a Customization Center and Project Roadrunner. </p>
<p> However, the commenter known as Peter claimed that a certain set of Android rumors were not a part of his elaborate and entertaining ruse. </p>
<p> Just last week, Sprint finally lit up its LTE network. Not before selling a number of LTE-equipped phones, however. If you were worried about Sprint's ability to keep up with the big dogs in the race to expand LTE coverage, the WSJ has some comforting words for you. Wait, did I say "comforting"? I'm sorry, I meant worrying. Very, very worrying. </p>
<p> The long and short of it is, Sprint simply doesn't seem to have enough spectrum to keep up. The initial LTE rollout covered 15 markets, compared to Verizon's 330 and AT&T's 47. Despite the rather distant third-place position, Sprint hopes to have coverage in all areas by the end of 2013. </p>
<p> I know the subject of Twitter buying another company is not directly related to Android, but considering the importance of the social service in our day-to-day operations and the target of the rumor being TweetDeck, a crowd favorite when it comes to Twitter clients, I thought I'd give this one a mention. </p>
<p> According to a report published today by The Wall Street Journal, Twitter is reportedly in talks to buy TweetDeck for $50 million. This comes after relatively recent news of UberMedia's $30 million bid in cash and stock. As we've seen, UberMedia and Twitter don't have the best rapport, so keeping TweetDeck out of UberMedia's hands may well be in the best interest of Twitter itself. </p>

<p> wtf </p>
<p> What's this? A bonus round of app sales... on a Thursday? Still your beating hearts, dear readers of mine, because while I have more apps for you today, I've decided to take a different approach. Due to the volume of yesterday's post and the amount of questionable applications in it, I am trying something new today. </p>
<p> The dating simulator genre is still somewhat niche, so here's a quick breakdown if you haven't heard about it. In a typical anime-style dating simulator, you play as a young man or woman (often high school or college age) looking for love. This usually means talking to a bunch of different characters and potential romantic interests in branching dialogue. It's like an old-school adventure game, but the stakes are your love life instead of saving the world. Hatoful Boyfriend [sic] is like that, except that all your suitors are pigeons. </p>
<p> I recall with fondness the endless speculative arguments I heard around the elementary school lunch table in the 90s: who would win in a fight between Batman and Wolverine? Goku and Superman? Bill Clinton and Emilio Estevez? (There was always that one weird kid.) Imagine the same arguments happening in a university zoology department, and you might just find the inspiration for Animelee, an old-fashioned one-on-one fighter recently published in the Play Store. It's all about animals beating the crap out of each other. Check out the eye-popping trailer below: </p>
<p> It has now been over two months since the Lollipop OTA updates for Nexus devices began rolling out en masse. So far, every Nexus and Google Play Edition device has received the bump to Google's latest sweet treat...except the cellular Nexus 7s. If you own a 2012 3G or 2013 LTE model, you've been left out in the cold, remaining on KitKat unless you want to venture into the world of custom ROMs. </p>
<p> Update delays when you own a Nexus are quite annoying when you consider that bleeding edge versions of Android are the reason most of us buy them in the first place. </p>
<p> Following on the success of the original xkcd Phone (which featured a blend of Android and iOS, a side-facing camera, and the ability to scream when falling), a successor has arrived that offers some of the best tech that 2014 has to offer. </p>
<p> The xkcd Phone 2 includes a revolutionary always-on front-facing speaker, which the phone will use to automatically cry when lost. With a built-in, ribbed, auto-rotating case made of 3D materials, the handset should feel comfortable in any hand size. And in a year where phones argued that HD wasn't HD enough, the xkcd Phone 2's MaxHD display competes by cramming over 350 pixels onto its screen (and doubling as a cheek toucher). </p>
<p> Not all new features are created equal, and this particular change has us kind of scratching our heads wondering why Google would consider it a good idea. In Lollipop, you can now access your quick settings straight from the lockscreen. This way you can toggle Wi-Fi, cellular data, and Bluetooth without unlocking the device, even if it's secured behind a passphrase. </p>
<p> Google's developers are notorious for including little jokes and easter eggs throughout all of their products. When your job consists of writing thousands of lines of code and testing obscure bugs, you're going to lose your mind without some kind of outlet. We usually see their sense of humor show up in Google Doodles, easter eggs, and even in the occasional bug report. </p>
<p> This time we're diving straight into the Android SDK to check out a function called isUserAGoat. This is for real, people. And as a few Android developers could tell you, it's actually been there since Android 4.2 (API 17). </p>
<p> Perhaps you recall back in 2012 when Google caught some flack for its 10-device limit on Play Music access with only four deauthorizations per year. It was forced to backpedal and allow users to deauthorize unlimited devices, and all was well with the world. Well, until now. It looks like Google has started enforcing a limit of four deauthorizations per year once again. Support docs and the Play Music settings list the limit. That means even regular users could suddenly find themselves unable to use All Access or get to their own stored tunes. </p>
<p> Classic American diners and 70s-era video games go hand in hand. No, wait a minute. That's an insane statement. Those things don't have anything to do with one another... until now. Denny's, the after-hours haunt of college students and cross-country travelers all over the United States, has launched a special version of three Atari video games. The app icon has Denny's bacon strips in place of the iconic stripes in Atari's logo. That tells you pretty much all you need to know. </p>
<p> The three games in question are Hashteroids, Centipup, and Take-Out, and no, you don't get any extra points for figuring out which classic arcade titles those titles are lampooning. </p>
<p> Some characters have to be shoehorned into an endless runner, but for Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog, the genre is a natural fit. Now Sega is offering a Nintendo-style promotion that's only available for Android. Here's your chance to take our lovable green Bugdroid out for a spin, as the developers have dropped it into the game and are daring players to see if machines really are better at everything. </p>
<p> But that's not all. Players who play as Bugdroid fifty times can permanently unlock "Andronic," a disturbingly deformed version of Sonic that looks as though it has been crammed into a soda can and given pills for limbs. Dr. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/wunderlist/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549056" filename="wunderlist">
<p> Today is finally the day Wunderlist dies, years after the Microsoft acquisition. Former users are encouraged to switch to Microsoft To Do, Wunderlist's spiritual successor as a Redmond product. To make the jump smoother on the last possible day, the company has added some more features known from Wunderlist, like overviews of your tasks for today, tomorrow, or the week ahead as well as new All and Completed smart lists. </p>
<p> Today's the day we say goodbye to Wunderlist, a beloved productivity app for many. The service was bought by Microsoft back in 2015, and the company preferred to replace it with a new app instead of keeping it alive. Sadly, To-Do, the in-house successor, didn't live up to several people's expectations, including myself, who turned to alternative solutions. It seems the developers are aware of their disappointment and have used the opportunity to announce a new productivity app called Superlist. </p>
<p> If you're a Wunderlist user, you're probably aware the app is set to disappear next month. I've personally used it for years and swore by it. I gave Microsoft's in-house replacement a try, but it wasn't good enough for me, so I had to turn to another solution. However, there's a new player on the market that might be the perfect replacement for Wunderlist, called Zenkit To Do. In fact, it looks so similar to Wunderlist that you might actually think it's just an updated version. </p>
<p> Microsoft has announced that it's finally killing the well-known and much-loved productivity app Wunderlist on May 6th, 2020. One app's end is another's "new beginning" according to the company, with all efforts now focused on Microsoft's descriptively titled "To Do," which was explicitly labeled at launch as a replacement that would ultimately result in Wunderlist's retirement. </p>
<p> It's looking like a busy week for the app devs at Microsoft. After yesterday's announcement that Groups is being added to the Outlook mail app, today sees another interesting addition to the company's productivity suite on Android. To-Do is Microsoft's attempt at an intelligent task management app, in much the same vein as Wunderlist, which was acquired by the Redmond giant back in 2015. </p>
<p> Microsoft wants Outlook to be the one destination you have to visit to know what's going on. It also wants to make use of the talent it acquired when it purchased Sunrise. So the company is delivering on old promises by introducing Calendar Apps, which let you see tasks and notes from different sources. The opening salvo of supported services consists of Evernote, Facebook, and Wunderlist. </p>
<p> Late yesterday, the Financial Times reported that SwiftKey was in talks with Microsoft about a potential acquisition that could be officially announced during the week. The report was right and this morning both Microsoft and SwiftKey have made the news official on their respective blogs. </p>
<p> The financial details of the acquisition weren't disclosed, but yesterday's report mentioned a $250 Million figure — or about a quarter Instagram if you want. The rest of the deal's terms aren't perfectly transparent either, but SwiftKey's co-founders Jon and Ben made it clear that the keyboard will continue to be developed for Android and iOS. </p>
<p> Our number one focus has always been to build the best possible products for our users. </p>
<p> Getting bought by Microsoft hasn't hindered the productive folks over at Wunderlist. They're now ready to roll out an update to their Android app with a revamped interface that finally looks good enough to deserve a Material Design adjective. Its previous update had claimed that, but it was actually the bastard child of some iOS and Android design elements. This one, on the contrary, does away with the clunky design, reduces a few shadows, flattens a couple of boxes, cleans some icons, and generally looks shiny, in a faded pastel kind of way. </p>
<p> The update isn't just superficial though. It adds a shortcut to create new tasks from the notification bar and a Quick-Add function to send tasks to their lists and assign dates to them (type "tomorrow at 9am" and Wunderlist will schedule your task for that time). </p>
<p> According to the Wall Street Journal, Microsoft has agreed to pay between $100 million and $200 million for 6Wunderkinder, the German company behind the to-do list app. </p>

<p> Take a look at the photo below and try to figure out exactly what it is. A head-mounted carbon fiber sunshade? The latest Milan fashion inspired by Catholic nun habits? A solar-powered personal telepathy machine for the eco-friendly supervillain? The answer is none of the above: it's a giant plastic dome that, according to creator Silentium, cancels out surrounding ambient noise. </p>
<p> That's right, it's a real version of the Cone of Silence, favored by agents of a certain fictional spy agency. </p>

<p> WWII </p>
<p> It might be tempting to think that there's nothing new under the sun for top-down airplane shoot-em-ups. After all, the genre has been kicking around since the 1970s. But you'd be wrong - in fact, the vertical layout and touch controls on smartphones make them ideal for this sort of title, as exemplified by Air Attack way back in 2011. The original game was one of our favorites during the initial Android boom, and now the sequel has arrived. Air Attack 2 is free to download on the Play Store today. </p>
<p> There were many real world ramifications from World War II, but one of the more relevant to our coverage on Android Police is that it gave developers material for no fewer than a zillion games. HandyGames saw success with its last WWII title, 1941 Frozen Front, and now the sequel known as 1942 Pacific Front is available for download. It's essentially the same thing but with less snow. </p>

<p> The exciting conclusion of our three-part HTC-leak-o-rama comes in the form of a yet-to-be-announced HTC tablet known as the "Puccini." Sounds like an Italian dish (Note: actually, Puccini was a famous Italian composer, so take what you will from the codename). Anyway, this thing's packing, here's what we know: </p>
<p> WXGA display (800x1280) - we're thinking 9-10" on that basis </p>
<p> MSM8660 dual-core processor (same chipset we just saw in the leaked HTC Lead) </p>
<p> Android Honeycomb 3.0.1 </p>
<p> AT&T LTE support </p>
<p> As an AT&T customer myself, between the HTC Lead and this guy, I'm pretty juiced. </p>
<p> Yesterday's announcement by Samsung of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 might have seemed like something of an echo of the Motorola XOOM. Well, with LG's recent unveiling of the Optimus Pad at MWC, we can still see some resemblance but with a few alterations making it worthy of further attention. </p>
<p> First up, the Optimus Pad refrains from the somewhat popular 10-inch screen diagonal seen on both Motorola and Samsung's tablets. If you have doubts about the handiness of a 10-inch device, it seems that LG shares your sentiments: the Optimus Tab scales the display back to 8.9 inches, while maintaining a similar 1280x760 WXGA resolution. </p>
<p> Right now at MWC 2011, Samsung's just released the first official confirmation of a new addition to the Galaxy Tab family, namely the Galaxy Tab 10.1. Unlike the 7-incher preceding it, the 10.1 packs a 1 GHz dual-core CPU and Android 3.0 Honeycomb. Rather like the controversially-priced Motorola XOOM, the 10.1 also includes a 1280 x 800 resolution screen and multiple cameras. </p>
<p> In terms of connectivity we find quad-band HSPA+, A/B/G/N WiFi, and Bluetooth 2.1. </p>
<p> While Toshiba's original attempts at an Android tablet running on the Tegra chip didn't exactly go down a storm, they seem keen to continue with Android devices, and brought a new tablet with them to CES. Artem got a video demo from one of their reps, and as you can see there are some attractive features to note. </p>
<p> Like the Motorola XOOM, the nameless Toshiba tablet (henceforth "Anon") has a 10.1" WXGA (1280x800) screen, which was unsurprisingly nice and crisp. </p>
<p> Taiwanese consumer electronics giant Acer is having a global press conference in New York right now, and they just wrapped up the hardware portion of the event. In its wake are three new Android devices to lust over. Rather than forcing you to go with one size only, Acer has an attractive trio to choose from. </p>
<p> 10.1" Tablet </p>
<p> First up was a 10-incher, powered by a 1GHz Tegra II. The device will run Google's "Android Tablet OS" (Honeycomb?) </p>

<p> Wyze only recently announced its first pair of over-ear headphones and a $30 video doorbell, and the company is continuing its foray into new product categories. It has just unveiled the Wyze Thermostat, a $50 smart thermostat that can be automated via the Wyze app and controlled with voice assistants. It's available for pre-order and will ship in December. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/03/31 10:01am PDTon Mar 31, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/05 11:01am PDTon Oct 5, 2020. </p>
<p> Millions of homes now contain a smart assistant speaker of some variety and sales of IoT products continue to grow as the market matures and prices come down across the sector. With so many options available, it's hard to know what to buy, and that's where we come in — this is a selection of our favorite smart home gadgets. Whether you want to just dip your toes in the water with a cheap Google Nest Mini or dive into the deep end with smart lights, cameras, thermostats, doorbells, and so on — we’ve got you covered. </p>
<p> Last week, smart home specialist Wyze announced its first foray into the over-the-ear noise-canceling headphones market alongside some other novelties like a $30 video doorbell and a smart thermostat. Back then, the price was still up for debate for the headphones, but that's changing today as the company is opening pre-orders. The Wyze Headphones will only cost $50, which could make them the absolute bang-for-buck champion. They're less than the budget Tribit QuietPlus 72 headphones we liked in our review. </p>
<p> Wyze offers some of the most affordable smart cameras on the market, but sometimes you get what you pay for. The company added person detection in July of last year, but it didn't last long. Apple purchased the firm providing Wyze with those AI capabilities, and it had to scramble to come up with a new solution. Wyze started beta testing its new person detection feature earlier this year, and now it's ready to roll out more widely — but there are still quite a few caveats. </p>
<p> It hasn't exactly been a secret that smart home company Wyze has been working on an outdoor camera. Wyze said it was beta-testing such a product in February, and the camera passed through the FCC in April. Now every little detail about the camera has been revealed, including the price. </p>
<p> Last year, budget-friendly smart home company Wyze announced its first smart lock, the appropriately named Wyze Lock. The company started taking pre-orders for the $90 Lock straight away, and we saw the hardware arrive a couple months back. But though the Lock itself had landed, we were still waiting to get the full picture on the optional Wyze Lock Keypad, which was announced alongside the Lock, but without pricing details or a firm release date. Now it's finally available, landing on the company's store for just about $20. </p>
<p> Installing a houseful of smart home upgrades gets expensive fast, which is why we're always excited when budget-conscious Wyze releases a new device. From internet-connected cameras, to security sensors, to smart outlets and even lightbulbs, Wyze has managed to prove itself in new product categories time and time again (well, with the occasional hiccup along the way). Now it's tackling the smart lock market, with the release of the aptly named Wyze Lock. How will it compare to more expensive solutions? Let's take a look. </p>
<p> Wyze's upcoming Outdoor Cam has just cruised past the FCC ahead of its upcoming launch. First spotted by Zatz Not Funny!, the listing includes internal/external product images and a product manual. Between the two, we have a good idea of what it looks like, we know it is battery powered with a detachable magnetic mount, and we know it will connect to a remote base station. </p>
<p> Wyze started off as a maker of simple smart home products that worked well and were affordable, but the company has started to expand rapidly. It just released a scale and door lock, and additional products like outdoor and doorbell cameras are in development. Another of its new products is the Wyze Band, a $25 fitness tracker that can also control your smart home devices. </p>
<p> I've been trying out the new Wyze Band for the past week, and while there's a surprising amount of functionality for a wearable product that costs so little, there are a few software quirks that ruin the experience. </p>
<p> Wyze, the company known for making affordable smart home products, was rumored to be working on a fitness tracking band and a smart scale. The company confirmed this information and released further details on their availability last month, hinting these devices were almost ready to hit the market. We now know they will be available for early access buyers on Tuesday. </p>

<p> Wyze is on a mission to convert your house into a full-blown smart home, even if it has to do so piece by piece. The company started out selling very affordable surveillance cameras, which have only become more powerful as they pick up new functionality. </p>
<p> Wyze has just revealed its latest smart home gadget, and this time it's a light bulb. The new Wyze Bulb is LED-based, works over Wi-Fi, doesn't need a hub, spits up to 800 lumens, and has both a tunable white point and adjustable brightness. While Wyze has opened early access pre-orders today, they don't ship until June. The official launch is nebulously set for "later this year." Prices will run $30 for four, or $8 for one. </p>

<p> Back in July, Wyze announced person detection on its security cameras which it implemented with the help of third-party service provider Xnor.ai. It seems like the contract between the companies lets the AI firm terminate the lease at any moment without reason, which is exactly what has happened, as Wyze announced in a blog post yesterday. Luckily, the camera manufacturer can continue using Xnor.ai's technology until mid-January 2020 and is already looking into rolling out its own in-house solution later next year. </p>
<p> Wyze offers a selection of great smart home products at affordable prices, but it's best known for its capable and inexpensive security cameras. In addition to support for local microSD card storage, they can also upload events detected by motion to the cloud, but clips have always been limited to 12 seconds. Now the company is testing a paid option that lets you upload full events to the cloud, without duration restrictions and cooldown rates. </p>
<p> Smart home and camera accessories brand, Wyze, is celebrating its 2-year anniversary since releasing the first Wyze Cam in 2017. To mark the occasion, the company is giving its customers free shipping on its entire portfolio of products, but only for today with a special promo code. </p>
<p> Smart home appliance maker Wyze is packing in all the functionality it can into the security cameras it charges well under $50 for.

<p> Last November, Wyze announced that person detection would disappear temporarily, due to Xnor.ai, a third-party service provider, terminating its contract with the smart home company. Wyze quickly responded with intentions to create an in-house replacement but gave no timeline beyond some point in 2020. While we're still waiting on broad availability, person detection has already returned for at least some users in alpha testing. </p>
<p> Wyze just formally revealed a timeline for a handful of upcoming smart home products, including an outdoor camera, doorbell camera, and an updated, in-house version of person detection following last year's loss of the feature. Most of the products the company talked about were already on our radar, but now we have dates for the Wyze Lock and more firm plans regarding other teased products. </p>

<p> wyze plug </p>
<p> No one wants to go broke while upgrading their house to become a smart home, and that's a big part of what's made Wyze hardware so appealing: straightforward functionality at a just-can't-be-beat price. Following the launch of Wyze Sense security sensors and the Wyze Bulb earlier this year, the company's smart home offerings are now joined by a solution for controlling existing appliances: the Wyze Plug. </p>
<p> The previously teased and leaked Wyze smart plug is now a reality. Well, it will be soon. It's real in that you can spend money on it, but Wyze won't send the plugs for a few more weeks. The price is predictably low, just like other Wyze products. For $14.99, you get a pair of Wyze smart plugs that pair with your favorite assistant and other Wyze products. </p>

<p> Smart home and camera accessories brand, Wyze, is celebrating its 2-year anniversary since releasing the first Wyze Cam in 2017. To mark the occasion, the company is giving its customers free shipping on its entire portfolio of products, but only for today with a special promo code. </p>
<p> We've covered various connected home security systems from the likes of Nest and Ring, but these systems can cost hundreds of dollars. That's just for a starter kit, too. You might get north of a grand before all your doors and windows are linked up. Enter Wyze, which has made a name selling ultra-cheap security cameras. The new Wyze Sense system costs a mere $20, and pairs with your existing Wyze cameras. </p>
<p> It would be unreasonable to expect the same performance from Wyze Sense that you'd get from something like Nest Secure, and indeed, it's not that powerful. However, you do get a surprising amount of functionality for chump change. </p>

<p> LineageOS is the most-used custom Android ROM around, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for others. Paranoid Android was a popular choice back in the KitKat days, and while the ROM returned in full force with Nougat builds in 2017, there hasn't been much news since. Now the project is back (again), touting Android 10 builds for nine phones so far. </p>
<p> LineageOS is the most popular custom ROM around, with official support for dozens of devices and a huge community. The project relies on the work of contributing developers, which means phones can just easily be dropped as they are added. Since we last covered LineageOS, a few new devices are now supported, while a handful of fan favorites have been dropped. </p>

<p> Like any new product, true wireless earbuds were initially prohibitively expensive, with limited available options on the market. As we all know, this is no longer the case for the ubiquitous audio companions that many of us now carry around every day. These days, you can find a pair of Bluetooth buds at any price point, including, somewhat surprisingly, impulse buy territory. Amazon is currently selling Tribit's X1 wireless earbuds for only $20 — a $10 markdown from an already affordable $29.99. </p>
<p> Yes, @evleaks has officially retired from leaking gadgets, but it appears Mr. Blass had one more treat for the tech community - images that appear to show the Moto X+1 in two variants, both emblazoned with Verizon logos. One is all-black, while the other sports a white front and a wooden back. </p>
<p> The images seem to match up with the images we previously leaked of what we believe to be the X+1, including the unique flash arrangement and somewhat confusing Motorola logo stamped into the back of the device. Around front, the front-facing speaker arrangement appears to match, and the home screen isn't too surprising, sporting Moto's minimalist skin. </p>
<p> Besides the TalkBand B1, Huawei introduced three other devices in their MWC presentation - the MediaPad X1 7.0, MediaPad M1 8.0, and the Ascend G6. The first is pegged as a phone/tablet hybrid, the second just a tablet (capable of Wi-Fi calling and SMS), and the third a budget to mid-range phone. </p>
<p> We'll take a quick look at all three, but let's start with the MediaPad X1. </p>
<p> MediaPad X1 7.0 </p>
<p> The X1 "combines the functionality of a smartphone and tablet" in its aluminum alloy body, and besides Huawei's own suite of software enhancements with Emotion UI 2.0, has plenty of specs worth looking twice at. </p>
<p> Lenovo has just unveiled its new X1 Hybrid laptop, which runs Windows with a twist – namely, it can boot into "Instant Media Mode," which allows the laptop to run off of a Snapdragon processor, utilizing custom software based on the Android 2.3 kernel. Ostensibly, this mode is meant for users who want to get through a long flight, or simply zone out with a variety of media, with double the battery life they'd have running Windows. </p>
<p> Interestingly, Lenovo won't explicitly state that the hybrid is running Android, likely because, as Gizmodo astutely points out, it isn't running actual Android. </p>

<p> x10 </p>
<p> Update: Here's our hands-on with the Excite x10 (note: we misstated that the processor is a Snapdragon S4, it's actually a TI OMAP4430 - we blame Toshiba's open bar): </p>
<p> It's no secret that Toshiba's first attempt at an Android tablet was on the receiving end of a decent amount of criticism for its less-than-ideal size, so the company decided to super-model up its newest offering to the world, the Excite X10. </p>
<p> Owners of the Sony Xperia X10 around the world are rejoicing, because after a long wait, the previously locked bootloader has finally been cracked. What does this mean, you ask? In a nutshell, it means that the X10 can now handle custom features that other Android devices have had for some time, like kernels that allow for overclocking/undervolting, native USB/Wi-Fi tethering, removal of the 32fps cap, and a myriad of other tweaks. </p>
<p> They may have publicly stated that the Xperia X10 wouldn't be receiving further Android updates just a few months ago, but it looks like Sony Ericsson has had a change of heart: they now say the phone will receive an update to Android 2.3.3 (Gingerbread) sometime in late Q2 or early Q3. You can apparently thank the Xperia PLAY, arc, and neo, as the company says similarities in development of these devices has made it easier to bring the update to the X10. </p>
<p> The impossible has happened: thanks to a new software update, the Xperia X10's Internet and Maps applications are finally multitouch-capable. And as if that weren't exciting enough for X10 owners, the update also introduces support for bi-directional languages (i.e. Arabic, Farsi, Thai, and Hebrew) - a nice addition, though definitely not as high up on most users' wish lists as a version of Android more recent than 2.1 (or 1.6, if you're using AT&T's edition of the device). </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson posted profits of 35 million euros ($47.14 million) in Q4 of 2010, due largely to major downsizing combined with a shift towards Android-based smartphones. Although Sony Ericsson sold fewer phones overall, Android enthusiasts will be happy to hear that they managed to sell over 9 million Android-based Xperia phones, including the X10, X10 Mini, X10 Pro, and X8, since their launch. </p>
<p> In the last year, Sony has made significant changes after reporting losses of 836 million euros in 2009 ($1.13 billion). </p>
<p> It seems the blogosphere is abuzz with the news that an EU trademark for the name Xperia Play has been awarded to Sony Ericsson, filed the first of the month. </p>
<p> Companies file for trademarks a lot, so we'll see if this name pans out. If it does, it'll quite possibly be the worst marketing decision by Sony Ericsson yet, and may indicate that the Sony mother-ship wants to reserve the Playstation phone name for a later, cooler, probably proprietary-OS device. </p>
<p> Try to contain your excitement, here: Sony-Ericsson will begin rolling out an the update to Android 2.1 (Éclair) for the Xperia X10, X10 Mini, and X10 Mini Pro devices starting November 1. As sarcastic as we are about being updated to an already out-of-date version, it's still a huge step up from the current Android 1.6. Major features of the updates: </p>
<p> Xperia X10: • HD video recording with continuous auto-focus for high quality videos • Upgrade of the Android platform to Android 2.1 • New back up and restore application, with extended content back up • 5 homescreens for apps, widgets, shortcuts and folders • Social phonebook which automatically syncs contact pictures from Facebook and shows when your friends are online </p>
<p> Xperia X10 mini and X10 mini pro: • Improved Bluetooth functionality with support for sending and receiving pictures, contacts and more • New backup and restore application with extended content back up • Automatic synchronization of your contact pictures between Facebook and your phone book • Improved ways of handling pictures, audio, text and numbers in your messages • Upgrade of the Android platform to Android platform 2.1 </p>
<p> Android 2.1 brings a slew of benefits on its own, so their "Upgrade of the Android platform to Android 2.1" entails an awful lot of changes on its own. </p>
<p> This morning Sony Ericsson posted a teaser video on YouTube explaining to X10 users the differences they will find in the update from Android 1.6 to 2.1. As painful as it is to watch a video of someone demonstrating five homescreens, slide-to-unlock and live wallpapers like they're brand new features, the video underscores the growing expectation that an update will be released for the X10 within the next few days. </p>
<p> (Note – It does have some wording on getting the update now – that is not yet really valid and it wasn’t scheduled to be released until the update is out there. </p>
<p> The lucky folks over at French tech blog JournalDuGeek got themselves some on-wrist time with Sony Ericsson's OLED Bluetooth watch/remote/alert terminal. If you're not familiar with the device, check out our coverage of its official announcement in September: Sony Ericsson Outs The LiveView Remote For Android Devices... </p>
<p> JDG posted some rather blurry pics of the device, whilst also disclosing a price and rough release date: €59 in November. Considering Sony are known for "aspirational" pricing, this is very pleasing if true. </p>
<p> To the sound of a resounding “Meh”, Sony Ericsson have publically indicated that they have dropped Symbian off their roadmap for future handsets. Having been a member of the Symbian Foundation since its creation, Sony Ericsson are now jettisoning the aging platform for greener fields, leaving Nokia as the sole steward of the Symbian brand. According to spokesman Aldo Liguori: </p>
<p> “[Sony Ericsson] have no plans for the time being to develop any new products to the Symbian Foundation standard or operating system” </p>
<p> Funnily enough, Sony Ericsson are still part of the Symbian Foundation, they just don’t have any Symbian handsets planned. </p>

<p> UK readers only: if you like adorable handsets running an operating system with an adorable mascot or, and perhaps more importantly, if you like free things, then you owe the X10 Mini a few minutes of your time. </p>
<p> It’s not the most powerful Android handset on the block, and hell, it’s not even running Android 2.1, for an attractive, and again, free, Android handset, it’s not a bad deal. </p>
<p> Of course, as with most free phone offers, it will require you to sign your soul away for two years with a new contract, but on the bright side, you have your choice of four carriers to deal with. </p>

<p> Thanksgiving is over, but you know what that means - Black Friday is now officially in full effect, and we're seeing some pretty good deals, some of which are getting snatched up in mere seconds (cough, $199.99 Toshiba Thrive). </p>
<p> One of such BF deals is the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc X12 with AT&T 3G frequencies for $319.99. The MSRP is listed at $549.99, and the price before today was somewhere around $370, so if you're looking for a slim and sexy Android Gingerbread device without signing a contract, this phone may very well be for you. </p>
<p> Just about a week after Sony Ericsson's latest plaything was first leaked, Mobile-Review's Martin Elm has gotten his greedy hands on the device, and frankly, his initial impressions make the phone seem seriously underwhelming. </p>
<p> Rather than making a truly competitive high-end device, SE appears to have taken the original X10, which never sold well to begin with, and tweaked it here and there without making any major changes. </p>
<p> On the hardware front, Sony Ericsson's bumped the camera's megapixel count from eight to twelve, although Mobile-Review found that the prototype they handled was limited to taking stills at 3MP, with the maximum resolution for video being 325x288. </p>
<p> Poor old Sony Ericsson fans; as soon as their X10s get updated to Android 2.1, a new phone leaks out to let them know that end-of-life for their tragically neglected handsets is not far off. However, with this shiny new leaked photograph of the "Anzu", X10 owners can at least take some solace in the fact that even Sony Ericsson's test devices are running outdated versions of Android, despite being rumoured to run Gingerbread on release. </p>

<p> LineageOS is the most popular custom ROM in existence, boasting official support for dozens of devices. The first Android 10 builds arrived earlier this month, and Lineage has continued to add to the roster of supported phones since then. The last time we covered the LineageOS 17.1, builds for the Nexus 6 and first-gen Pixels had just arrived, and there are even more additions now. </p>
<p> At an event in Madrid today, Realme officially introduced three new smartphones that share one particular attribute in common: they all have 4 cameras on the back. The Chinese brand — part of the BBK family along with OnePlus, Oppo, and Vivo — is marking its entry into the European market with the new devices, including the powerhouse X2 Pro. </p>
<p> LineageOS is one of the most popular custom Android ROMs available, with over two million active installations. The project officially ended support for the 14.1 (Android 7.1) branch a few days ago, in preparation for LineageOS 16. The 16.0 branch is finally rolling out, and it's bringing Android 9 Pie to dozens of phones and tablets. </p>
<p> LineageOS is the most popular custom ROM by far, and the project continues to update more devices to version 15.1 (based on Android 8.1 Oreo). Last time we covered LineageOS, the OnePlus 2, Pixel C, and Nexus 6 received Oreo. Since then, several more devices have been updated, including Google's flagship phone from 2012. </p>
<p> In recent years, people have commonly associated Jaybird with quality; their earbuds are widely considered some of the best available on the market. However, good stuff comes at higher prices—or so we thought. Now, as part of Best Buy's 50-year anniversary sale, you can pick the Jaybird X2 earbuds up for just $69.99. </p>
<p> There are a plethora of in-ear sports Bluetooth headsets for sale on Amazon, but if you want great sound and quality, it's hard to beat the Jaybird X2. I haven't had a chance to use them myself, but I know Artem loves his set. </p>
<p> The biggest reason I've hesitated in picking up a pair is the price. $180 bucks is a lot to drop on a set of headphones, even when they are as good as these. Well, the temptation has grown a lot stronger today because Amazon just dropped the price by more than $50 to $126.25. That's getting pretty dang close to my impulse buy territory. </p>
<p> The big question on everyone's mind when Nokia revealed the Android-powered X line was whether their new masters at Microsoft would continue the line after the acquisition. It looks like Redmond is ready for another lap around the Android pool, at least in conjunction with its extensively-customized software load, because Nokia just announced the X2 for immediate release. The 99 Euro ($135) phone is "available immediately in select countries globally." Both global and select, huh? </p>
<p> This is technically a second-generation phone, and the X2 is the fourth Nokia retail device to run Android, but since it's only been four months since the unveiling of the original X, X+, and XL, I'd say that this is more of an evolutionary step than a true sequel. </p>
<p> Droid X2 owners should be keeping an eye out for a new OTA set to roll out "soon," bringing the device's build up to 1.3.418.MB870. The OTA is pretty light, coming in at around 35MB, and bringing a small handful of enhancements and fixes to the X2, which debuted almost one year ago. Included in the update are Verizon's Video and VZ Navigator 3D City, Google's security patch, Wireless Alerting System compatibility, and a few other small improvements. </p>
<p> As usual, Verizon has provided a cheat sheet with instructions on how to manually check for the update, but by now the process should sound pretty familiar: just tap Settings > About Phone > System Updates > Download. </p>
<p> Update: June 4, 2011 - I've taken an awful lot of flak for this review (and that's fine). I stand by the review because I can't honestly recommend this phone in good conscience. With that in mind, I realize that not everyone may share my opinions, and that's why I suggest potential purchasers go and take a look at it to see if they will notice the screen issues as much as I do. </p>
<p> Further, a lot of you seem to think I was using or inspecting the phone in a critical way; this was not the case. I noticed the screen and performance issues immediately and continuously under normal use conditions. </p>

<p> X2 Pro </p>
<p> Realme might be the newest and least well known of the BBK Electronics family that includes Oppo, Vivo, and OnePlus, but it’s certainly no less ambitious. After starting out as an Oppo sub-brand it was given license to operate more independently in 2017, and since then Realme has sold so many devices that it’s now the fastest-growing smartphone maker in the world. Its foray into the European market only really began in earnest this year, but aggressive pricing looks to be to paying dividends as it goes after more established Chinese rivals such as Xiaomi and Honor/Huawei. </p>
<p> It might be the least known of the BBK family of Chinese smartphone manufacturers, but Realme is making a splash in the European market with the launch of its X2 Pro flagship, which is now on general sale in Europe. The sister company of OnePlus, Oppo, and Vivo looks to continue with a trend we've seen from many Chinese phone makers in recent years by offering insane specs for a ridiculously low price. </p>

<p> Given the recent rise of truly wireless earbuds, we're starting to see some quality sales on the previous generation of tethered Bluetooth earbuds. Today, we have a deal from Jaybird (a headphone maker known for their fitness-focused lineup) on their X4 wireless earbuds, which are marked down to $70 on Amazon— their lowest price yet. It looks like the X4s have been available for around $110 for most of the year, and this latest reduction could save you an additional $40. </p>
<p> Project Fi, Google's pre-paid carrier, isn't quite as appealing as it once was. Now that the Nexus 5X and 6P are not sold (and suffering from hardware issues), the only phones available on Fi are the Pixel and Pixel XL. And unlike most pre-paid carriers, you can't use whatever device you want, as Fi uses specialized software to switch between networks. Customers have been asking Project Fi to begin selling cheaper devices once again, and the carrier has been listening. </p>

<p> This week at MWC, Intel revealed its 2015 and 2016 mobile chipset lineup, as well as the fact that the company is adopting a similar naming scheme to its Core line of processors with these new chips. They've been dubbed x3, x5, and x7, and as with the Core processors, bigger is generally better. </p>
<p> Intel has long been something of a dark horse in the mobile industry. The company has seen negligible penetration in smartphones to date (though not none) and competes almost exclusively in the low to mid-range segment in Android tablets. Of course, as the ultraportable market changes and small, super-thin laptops and convertibles become more common, Intel is swooping in with design wins left and right, keeping the likes of Qualcomm, NVIDIA, MediaTek, and Samsung out of a lucrative market. </p>

<p> Vivo's impressive gimbal camera system was first announced with the Apex 2020 concept phone in March this year but made its way into a handset people can buy soon after. The flagship series unveiled in China last month consisted of an X50, X50 Pro, and X50 Pro+. The priciest Pro+ model is still only available in China, but the other two are set to come to global markets over the coming months. </p>
<p> At the company's "5G Day" event in San Diego yesterday, Qualcomm announced that it had secured 18 OEM partners to build 5G devices using its new X50 5G modem in 2019. Notable among them are handset makers Nokia (HMD), Sony, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, HTC, LG, ASUS, and ZTE. Conspicuously absent at the time of this writing is Samsung, though the two companies did just announce a long-term cross-licensing agreement, so you'd have to think they were on track to build a phone with this new modem, too. </p>
<p> Other companies in the list can be found in the press release below, though most of the others are in the component or supply chain side of the business. </p>
<p> 5G is still a few years away for most of us, but networks and tech companies are laying the groundwork for it right now. One year ago, Qualcomm announced it was developing its first 5G-capable mobile modem, the X50. If you're not familiar with mobile SoCs, the modem is the component of a phone that connects to a cellular network. Qualcomm promised speeds of up to 5Gbps, with an expected ship date of 2018. </p>

<p> This week at MWC, Intel revealed its 2015 and 2016 mobile chipset lineup, as well as the fact that the company is adopting a similar naming scheme to its Core line of processors with these new chips. They've been dubbed x3, x5, and x7, and as with the Core processors, bigger is generally better. </p>
<p> Intel has long been something of a dark horse in the mobile industry. The company has seen negligible penetration in smartphones to date (though not none) and competes almost exclusively in the low to mid-range segment in Android tablets. Of course, as the ultraportable market changes and small, super-thin laptops and convertibles become more common, Intel is swooping in with design wins left and right, keeping the likes of Qualcomm, NVIDIA, MediaTek, and Samsung out of a lucrative market. </p>

<p> The impossible has happened: thanks to a new software update, the Xperia X10's Internet and Maps applications are finally multitouch-capable. And as if that weren't exciting enough for X10 owners, the update also introduces support for bi-directional languages (i.e. Arabic, Farsi, Thai, and Hebrew) - a nice addition, though definitely not as high up on most users' wish lists as a version of Android more recent than 2.1 (or 1.6, if you're using AT&T's edition of the device). </p>
<p> It seems the blogosphere is abuzz with the news that an EU trademark for the name Xperia Play has been awarded to Sony Ericsson, filed the first of the month. </p>
<p> Companies file for trademarks a lot, so we'll see if this name pans out. If it does, it'll quite possibly be the worst marketing decision by Sony Ericsson yet, and may indicate that the Sony mother-ship wants to reserve the Playstation phone name for a later, cooler, probably proprietary-OS device. </p>
<p> Today, Sony Ericsson officially announced the Xperia X8, formerly known as ‘Shakira’, which will offer a middle ground between the Xperia X10 and X10 Mini. </p>
<p> Running Android 1.6, the software used on the X8 makes the most of the limited screen estate on offer. Utilizing Sony Ericsson’s signature application used in the other Xperia devices, the X8 allows the user to stay connected with social networks using the Timescape application. </p>
<p> If you aren’t already familiar with Timescape, all information about one contact is kept in the same place, so the user can easily access their contact’s Facebook posts and Tweets, or simply find an email address or phone number. </p>

<p> Google may have introduced Google TV last month, but Apple TV has been around long before that. Problem is, there hasn't been any Apple TV Android app, and that includes for Android TV devices — at least, until now. Select Sony ATV models are beginning to receive an update that installs the Apple TV app, which includes access to Apple TV+, Apple TV channels, new and popular movies, and personalized and curated recommendations. </p>
<p> With far fewer social events than before, chances are that you're probably sitting in front of the TV a lot more than usual. If you're looking to upgrade, the 65" Sony X900H 4K HDR TV with Android TV built-in has fallen to an all-time low of just $998, over $400 off MSRP. </p>
<p> Watched the presidential debate last night but wish you could've seen it on a bigger screen? Yeah, me neither. But right now, you can snag a 55" or 65" Sony 4K Ultra HD Smart TV with HDR for up to $200 off from both Amazon and Best Buy — and since these sets run Android TV with a built-in gaming mode, you'll be able to stream your favorite shows and play your favorite games better than ever before on 4K HDR panels with Dolby Vision. </p>
<p> Several Sony X900-series 4K HDR TVs are currently discounted at Amazon and Best Buy, ranging in price from $1,169.99 for the cheapest 65" TV to a whopping $3,798 for the flagship 85" X950H unit.

<p> XA1 Plus </p>
<p> Sony is usually quick to update their phones to the latest version of Android, but like many other manufacturers, it usually leaves the budget devices for last. The Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra were launched a year ago, both with MediaTek Helio P20 chips and impressive 23MP back cameras. Now the XA1, XA1 Plus, and XA1 Ultra are being updated to Android 8.0 Oreo. </p>
<p> Here at IFA 2017 in Berlin, Sony has taken the opportunity to unveil its latest flagship devices. The Xperia XZ1 and its Compact sibling are here to replace the year-old XZ and X Compact, and they offer slightly updated designs with the latest Snapdragon 835 processors, plus they'll also be among the first devices to ship with Android 8.0 Oreo. The mid-range 5.5" Xperia XA1 Plus was also introduced to fill the gaping hole between the 5" XA1 and 6" XA1 Ultra. </p>

<p> xa2 </p>
<p> If you're in the market for an affordable phone that's guaranteed to get some sweet Android 9 Pie action, have we got a pair of deals for you. Both the Sony Xperia XA2 and Xperia XA2 Ultra are on sale at B&H, and both are scheduled to get an update to the newest version of Android this spring. </p>
<p> At the start of the year, Sony unveiled two new mid-range smartphones in the Xperia XA2 and XA2 Ultra. They offered familiar Sony stylings, with chunky bezels and squared off corners, but the Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 chips and rear fingerprint sensors represented a considerable improvement over their XA1 predecessors. </p>
<p> Today, Sony has announced another entry in the lineup, the Xperia XA2 Plus. It features the same Snapdragon 630 SoC, and many of the same specs as the XA2 Ultra, but is the first in the series to include an elongated 18:9, 6-inch FHD+ display. This phone will sound better, too, with Sony's High-Resolution Audio technology and DSEE HX audio upscaling. </p>
<p> Sony seems serious about improving its smartphone game. The Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra, despite having interesting camera setups and not-terrible pricing, were let down by the lacks of a Snapdragon processor and a fingerprint sensor. The XA2 and XA2 Ultra, which were leaked a few days ago, fix that with a Snapdragon 630 and a rear-mounted scanner. Also announced was the budget-oriented Xperia L2, which sports a rear fingerprint sensor as well. </p>

<p> Remember back in December (and January) when Packt Publishing gave away a couple free ebooks focused on Android development? The one-a-day promotion has been going strong since, but the books haven't exactly been targeted at the OS on our phones. But great news: this whole week is dedicated to mobile development! </p>
<p> The current freebie is all about showing love to both sides of the phone war – it's Xamarin Cross-platform Application Development. But you better hurry over and claim it, this particular book will expire in just over 5 hours. (Sorry, we saw this one a little late). </p>
<p> While the free book is enough reason to drop by, there's something more interesting afoot in this promotion. </p>
<p> Microsoft makes a lot of apps for multiple platforms. It also makes a lot of tools that are used by other developers to build apps for multiple platforms. It only makes sense then that the company would be interested in buying Xamarin, one of the leading platform providers for mobile app development. </p>
<p> While you may not have heard of Xamarin, its solution counts as one of the invisible threads that play a role in running the Internet nowadays. The platform helps developers use a shared codebase in C# to build, test, and monitor native apps for iOS, Android, and Windows, all with the same IDE, language, and APIs. </p>

<p> xav-ax100 </p>
<p> Android Auto is pretty cool, but the requirement of an expensive headunit for your car (or a new car that shipped with Android Auto support) set the barrier of entry pretty high. Thankfully, Google added the ability to use the Android Auto interface on your phone last year. Still, if you want the full Android Auto experience, a compatible Sony head unit is currently $398 ($100 off) from select sites. </p>
<p> Android Auto is starting to pick up a little bit of steam, which is nice to see for us car audio nerds. Recently, Auto hit v2.0 which brought with it some changes, including an on-phone mode. For those of us who do not have a fancy new car that includes the smartphone connectivity, aftermarket headunits are our next best bet. That brings us to Sony's first dip into this particular arena, the XAV-AX100. Announced back in August, we only got some news about features. Well, now this bad boy is up for pre-order at $499. </p>
<p> Sony has a new Android Auto head unit - its first, actually - the catchily-named XAV-AX100. The main draw of the device seems to be the sound quality, with four "55-watt Dynamic Reality Amp 2" amplifiers and Sony's EXTRA BASS low-boost circuitry supposedly overcoming engine noise to deliver crystal clear sound. </p>
<p> On the Android side, Sony says the XAV-AX100 has Android Auto 2 installed. If you're not overly sure what that is, you're not alone. Maybe it's the things Google announced at I/O this year for Auto? That would include things like OK Google hotwording and OEM apps, but possibly the most important announcement, WiFi projection mode - which means the Android Auto connection from your phone to the head unit is wireless - is not mentioned in the blog post Sony published today. </p>

<p> Not content with making a stylish Android set-top box, Razer is also planning on attacking the Android gaming market on its home turf. The Serval is a full-sized, console-style Bluetooth game controller that's compatible with both Razer's Forge TV and direct connection with Android phones and tablets. It's far from the first controller made with Android in mind, but it's the first to come from perhaps the most high-profile game peripheral company out there, and is thus worthy of examination. </p>
<p> There's a startling amount of crossover between people who use Android for their mobile needs and Windows and Xbox for their desktop and console gaming. The SmartGlass app has been a definite hit for Xbox 360 users who also have Windows Phone 7 devices... all eight of them. Now Android users can join the fun: Microsoft's released the official SmartGlass app for Android, available for free in the Play Store. </p>
<p> If you're not familiar with SmartGlass, it controls just about every aspect of the media-friendly Xbox 360 aside from actual game control. </p>
<p> When on{x} showed up as an Android exclusive from Microsoft, we figured it was just a fluke. Then Android got its own Xbox LIVE app straight from MS, and things got interesting. Now, Microsoft has launched its first Android game: Kinectimals. Sure, it's not Microsoft's most popular game, but it does show that the company is willing to take Android more seriously. Even at the risk of its own mobile OS. </p>
<p> Well, this sure came out of left field. Microsoft has released an official Xbox LIVE app for Android! The app can be used to view and modify your 3D Xbox avatar, track your achievements, connect with Xbox LIVE friends, and even get news and information from the Xbox Spotlight feeds. Color us surprised at how fully featured this app is. </p>
<p> The app has a distinctly Metro UI feel to it, which is unsurprising as Redmond has been keen to slather the vector-based UI on all of its properties these days, but the theme definitely clashes with Android. </p>
<p> Despite all this talk about upcoming phones and tablets running on the Tegra 2 processor, you may want to stop and consider the new offering in the Snapdragon line of processors from Qualcomm. Taking a 28-nm dual core beast (MSM8960), the company promises speeds up to five times their current offerings, as well as 75% less lower power usage. </p>
<p> But the real shocker here is the updated GPU, which Qualcomm claims is capable of delivering gaming performance equal to the of an Xbox 360 or PS3. </p>

<p> Xbox Game Streaming officially launched yesterday, allowing you to stream nearly 200 Xbox games to your Android phone or tablet. The service has yet to launch on any other platforms, and Microsoft is sticking hard to the mobile requirement — despite their ability to run Android apps, both Chromebooks and Android TV are unsupported. </p>
<p> Apple's draconian App Store policies have been criticized time and time again, and most recently, they led to a lawsuit by Epic Games. The company also recently blocked game streaming services like Google Stadia and Xbox Game Streaming from entering the App Store. Apple has now updated its policies to allow game streaming services, but only if they go through many hoops. </p>
<p> Xbox Game Streaming (formerly known as xCloud) is shaping up to be one of the best game streaming services around, and after the platform's recent ban from the Apple App Store, Android will be its only mobile home. Later this year, the service will have even more games from publisher Electronic Arts, thanks to a new partnership between the two companies. </p>

<p> GDC 2019 is next month, and in preparation for the event, the official schedule has been made available on the GDC Conference website. Notably, one of the sessions on the calendar is supposed to cover a first look at a new SDK from Microsoft that will allow mobile game developers to integrate the Xbox Live service into their titles. </p>
<p> Microsoft has already dabbled around with expanding the Xbox Live experience to mobile devices, but if a recent report from The Verge is to be believed, the company may be about to ramp up its efforts significantly. Our good friend Sources, who is familiar with Microsoft's plans, claims that Microsoft is building a platform that would extend Xbox Live functionality to Android and iOS. Instead of using Google Play Games or Apple's Game Center to track achievements, find other players, and compete with one another, you would be able to use Xbox Live instead. </p>
<p> Your contribution will have direct impact on how we win back our game developers from our competitors. </p>

<p> After many weeks of speculations, Nokia and Microsoft finally announced minutes ago that the 2 companies are entering a strategic partnership "to build a new global mobile ecosystem." </p>
<p> Nokia has been struggling to keep up with the exploding smartphone market in the past years, and it was clear that something needed to be done. </p>
<p> MeeGo, Nokia's latest bet at replacing its aging Symbian system with a new, open sourced, Linux-based OS, has been in development since 2010, but no phones running this OS have been released by the company yet. </p>
<p> In an effort to regain market share, Nokia had to pick - either join forces with Android, a giant growing at incredible speeds, or side with the newcomer - Windows Phone 7 from Microsoft, a company Nokia can trust (their current CEO, Stephen Elop, spent almost 3 years as a Microsoft VP of BizDev). </p>

<p> xbox media center </p>
<p> Writing about the XBMC media center software almost always takes a little explanation. The open-source XBMC was formerly known as the "Xbox Media Center," because its first release way back in 2003 was based on the "Xbox Media Player" and intended to run on modified Xbox game consoles. Because the software no longer officially runs on the Xbox, and has never run on newer consoles like the Xbox 360, and in fact runs on a heck of a lot of hardware that bears no X at all, the creators have renamed the software "Kodi." </p>
<p> Earlier this week, we mentioned that the amazing folks behind the XBMC project are bringing the app to Android. Well, it's still very early, but would you like to see what it's gonna be like? Of course you do. If you've got a Nexus Q or an Android-compatible set top box, you can download the apk from our mirrors below. For the rest of you, here's what it looks like running on a lovingly hacked Nexus Q, courtesy of Cyanogenmod developer Jason Parker: </p>

<p> Xbox Music </p>
<p> Xbox Music is now Groove. This is news that Microsoft detailed weeks ago, but it's only now—coinciding with the release of Windows 10—that we're seeing the name change on Android. </p>
<p> In the latest version, the rebranding has taken place. Microsoft highlights the ability to upload your music to OneDrive, stream music with a Music Pass subscription ($9.99 a month or $99 a year), and save files for offline use. </p>
<p> Not wasting any time, Sonos has already announced that it supports Groove. The integration is still in beta, but you're free to try it out right away. Look for it under Add Music Services. </p>
<p> Microsoft has a music app. No, really, they do! It may have escaped your notice with the launch of a new service from a certain other company and the continuing dominance of Spotify, but the Xbox Music service is still going strong. Sort of - apparently Microsoft didn't think that brand name was strong enough, so they changed it to Groove. That name hasn't made it to the official Android app, for some reason. </p>
<p> But some other much-needed changes have been implemented in version 3.0, specifically the ability to access your Microsoft account and stream music stored on your OneDrive cloud. </p>
<p> Remember when Microsoft angered legions of fans by announcing that the Xbox One would require an Internet connection to use? The company reversed that decision, but thus far, the Xbox Music Android app has functioned in much the same way. Fortunately for it, streaming music is already an established thing, so there won't be nearly as many people excited to find out that the newest version of the app now supports playing playlists offline. </p>
<p> A single switch appears on each playlist that designates which ones should be downloaded, somewhat similar to pinning lists within Play Music. Once toggled, users should be able to take those tunes anywhere that lacks a solid data connection, like an airplane or, depending on their carrier, most of the country. </p>

<p> If you're an Xbox Insider in the Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead rings in the US and UK, you can now start testing out Microsoft's Xbox Console Streaming service, which streams any Xbox One game to an Android device. The prerequisites for the service are a bit restrictive, but going through the steps will let you put in some Gear 5 gameplay during your work or school commute. </p>
<p> We've known since June that Microsoft was working on integrating Alexa and Google Assistant with Xbox in lieu of its own voice assistant, Cortana. With Alexa support already up and running on Xbox One, it's now time for Google Assistant to get in on the action. </p>
<p> Xbox One users, here's a piece news for you on Android Police, of all places. According to Windows Central, you may soon be able to control your gaming/entertainment console with voice commands, thanks to the addition of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant support. </p>
<p> Minecraft could be considered this generation's Doom - it runs on everything. Beyond the original Java-based game, there are versions for the Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, New 3DS, Nintendo Switch, Wii U, PS Vita, iOS, Android, Windows 10, Amazon Fire TV, and Apple TV. This is made even more confusing by some editions having different features. Minecraft's 'Better Together Update' is the first step in addressing the feature fragmentation and implementing cross-play support. </p>
<p> One of the major problems with Minecraft is the number of different editions, with varying level of multiplayer cross-play. This stems from different code bases - the console versions are based on the original Java game, while Pocket/Windows 10 Edition use the same C++ code base. But the upcoming Minecraft PE 1.2 update, nicknamed the 'Better Together Update,' aims to address this. </p>
<p> The Xbox 360 controller has been the de facto standard for years (NVIDIA copied it almost exactly for the SHIELD line), and the Xbox One has a refined and streamlined version of that design. So when Microsoft announced that a shiny new revision of the Xbox One controller would not only let you choose your colors and engraving Moto Maker-style, but also include a Bluetooth connection for easy dongle-free pairing with PCs, I couldn't help but get excited. Might Android gamers finally get access to the best controller around without any USB frippery or root-enabled work-arounds? </p>
<p> The Xbox Smartglass app has been available on Android for a while, letting users control the Xbox's media functions, such as play, pause, and menu navigation, directly through the app. Today, at Microsoft's E3 press conference, the app is getting a big update, being renamed to just 'Xbox' and with features comparable to the equivalent on Windows 10. With the app, you can use Xbox Live, buy games, or watch game content shared by other users, making it the ultimate companion to the Microsoft-made box sitting near your TV. </p>

<p> The banner features of the update are mostly to do with Xbox Live, Microsoft's online gaming network. </p>
<p> Microsoft's SmartGlass app is a smartphone-based manager for the Xbox One, and it gets some surprisingly frequent love from the developers for a product intended for a direct Google competitor. The latest beta version is a significant bump, 2.4 to 3.16, though the changes aren't immediately obvious beyond a few cosmetic adjustments. The new user interface moves quite a few elements around, and if it isn't completely "material" then at least Microsoft is trying to make it look like an Android app instead of a tiny Xbox window. </p>
<p> Microsoft has pushed out an update to the SmartGlass beta app that lets users turn their Xbox One consoles on and off from their Android devices. This way you can start streaming content directly to your tablet without having to reach for a separate controller beforehand. </p>
<p> This update has also expanded the ability to stream live TV in 19 countries. Unfortunately the changelog doesn't list them, and the full list hasn't yet appeared on the Xbox TV Tuner's support page. </p>
<p> Microsoft's Xbox One SmartGlass Beta lets owners of the console try out a few new features before they reach the release version of the app. In the latest Beta update, SmartGlass gained two new options that must be exciting for Australian TV fans, and just one for Dutch users. </p>
<p> If you live in Australia, Xbox' OneGuide should now be functional for you. This TV guide shows the schedule for various Australian terrestrial channels, letting users browse the programming for a few days and maybe plan some of their entertainment accordingly. The more interesting news, however, is that Australia is getting the Xbox One Digital HD Tuner, now available for pre-order on the Microsoft Store for AU$39.95 with a release date slated for March. </p>

<p> Bethesda recently updated the Android versions of Doom and Doom II to bring a bunch of new features to the titles, such as tweaked touch controls, support for adjustable frame rate limits, not to mention physical controller support along with mouse and keyboard support. Heck, Bethesda even added a toggle for Vsync (a rarity for a mobile game), for those of you that would like to reduce either title's input latency. So no matter how you slice it, it would appear that Bethesda has actually improved both games, though it could be argued that all of these features should have been available in both titles from the jump. </p>
<p> A couple years back, Microsoft released a Bluetooth-compatible version of its Xbox One controller, further cementing the company's game controller dominance. But when it came to using one with an Android device, there was a big catch: button mapping was broken compared to other controllers. According to a recent change on Google's bug tracker, that problem has been resolved in Android P. </p>

<p> While most of us won't be getting our hands on Xbox Ones until November 22nd (or ever, if that's not your thing), a few lucky souls would probably be happy to hear that the official SmartGlass app for the console is now out on Android. This app is rebuilt from the ground up compared to the old Xbox 360 companion, and while it does do much of what the old app did (in addition to a few new things), it's got a brand-new Windows 8-esque interface. </p>

<p> XCOM </p>
<p> If you're a gamer, you probably know XCOM as the recently revived turn-based alien killin' strategy game. It's also been given an official board game, a natural fit for the turn-based combat so heavily featured in the digital version. Until today you needed an iOS device for the mandatory companion app, which handles such fiddly things as player turns and hit percentages - the things your DM used to do on pen and paper. </p>
<p> If you're a fan of strategy games, you had a very good month in November. In addition to soft strategy like Kingdom Rush: Origins and Godus, you've got new entries in the XCOM and Civilization series, not to mention the very impressive newcomer The Banner Saga. There are also some respectable entries in what you might call the casual genre (if you weren't busy swearing at some of the higher levels in The Blocks Cometh), and we've added a few honorable mentions as well. </p>
<p> The truth is out there... and you can shoot it. XCOM: Enemy Unknown is one of the best turn-based strategy games in years, which is why we were thrilled to see it get a mobile re-release on Android (even if we did have a hefty wait behind iOS). You can now get the expansion pack to the original, Enemy Within, and surprisingly it's being released as a standalone game - that means that unlike the PC and console versions, you don't have to own the original to play it. </p>
<p> April has showered us with a ton of Android games, many of which are revivals or straight-up ports of notable releases on the PC and console platforms. There are more than a few awesome mobile-style games as well, so you've got a lot of variety to choose from in this month's best of the best. What follows is our picks for the top crop of Android games in April, in no particular order. </p>
<p> Look, this story is about 450 words long. But you don't have time for all that. Here's the skinny: if you fancy yourself a fan of strategy games, and if you've got a reasonably powerful Android machine with about 4GB of free space, aaaaand you don't mind paying ten bucks for a mobile version of a game that was fifty bucks when it debuted two years ago, then you should go buy XCOM: Enemy Unknown right now. </p>

<p> The XDA forums are the capitol of all Android root/ROM development efforts these days, and from its multitudes of developers and endless pages of posts come most of the homebrew software that provides us with root access, liberates draconian device restrictions, and keeps older phones ticking. Android enthusiasts aren't the only ones making use of the software there, though. Turkish OEM General Mobile recently rolled out its own Android Q beta program for two of its phones even though it isn't among the manufacturers Google lists as participating in these early Q tests. </p>
<p> Google appears to be working on support for digital ID cards including digital driver's licenses in a future version of Android. The new IdentityCredential API, spotted by the folks at XDA, may allow for a future Android-powered phone to store credentials, and even offer up those credentials when the device doesn't have enough power to boot. </p>
<p> XDA has managed to get its hands on an early build of Android Q, confirming that Google's next version of our favorite operating system will include a dark mode, as expected. But plenty of more secrets were hiding inside the image XDA found, including a much-needed app permissions revamp, what may end up being a Samsung DeX-like desktop UI, and piles of smaller features. </p>
<p> This spring, Google announced "pausing" development on Allo as it repurposed development resources for RCS/Chat and Android Messages. At least one feature from Allo seems to be making its way over to Android Messages as a result of the change, though. The folks at XDA have just discovered hidden Assistant integration in Android Messages — though it's a bit incomplete at the moment. </p>
<p> Last year, Google released v2.0 of its "Nearby Connections" API, which allows for your gadgets to communicate with other devices in close proximity via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It was a part of the overall "Nearby" package, which also includes a few other systems for more specific applications, including messaging and notifications. According to a pair of commits recently spotted by the folks at XDA Developers, these Nearby APIs may be coming to Chromebooks. </p>
<p> Google's been throwing its Smart Replies at pretty much every app or venue capable of accepting them, from Android Messages to Gmail. It even has a standalone app that introduces the shortcuts—and their occasionally borderline-offensive responses—to third-party app notifications. Now Gboard is testing out adding the same feature to other applications like Facebook and WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Google has always controlled which devices ship with its proprietary GApps—a package that includes such necessities as the Play Store and Google Play Services. Until now, they've even been pretty lenient about allowing custom ROM users to flash the necessary payload on top of their modified OS. Unfortunately, some OEMs used that loophole to their advantage, ignoring Google's CTS certification process while shipping devices with GApps or shamelessly encouraging users to sideload them. </p>
<p> According to XDA Developers, that loophole has now been closed. Google Play Services will soon check the build date for a given system image, and if that date is after March 16th, it will be blocked from completing the sign-in process—though custom ROM users can manually register their devices for an exemption. </p>
<p> Over the past several months, I've become increasingly familiar with how to block phone numbers in Google's Phone app: reject a suspicious call, go into my call history, long-press the dubious number, then tap "Block/report spam." This process is simple enough, but it's still just a reactionary, case-by-case measure. Android P may improve this call-blocking experience by giving users a smarter, preemptive way to block types of phone numbers — that is, so long as your carrier doesn't get in the way </p>
<p> One of Android's biggest criticisms over the years has been how fragmented its version distribution is at any given time. At Google I/O in May last year, Google unveiled a plan to modularize the OS and make it easier to update. Project Treble, in short, separates out the base-level Android framework from the vendor implementation so OEMs are able to release OS updates without having to wait for chipmakers to update drivers. </p>
<p> Faster updates should increase the distribution numbers for the latest version of Android, but Treble could also be useful for custom ROM developers, allowing generic AOSP builds ("Treble ROMs") to be installed on more phones. </p>
<p> Many of us love the simplicity of the Google Camera app that comes pre-installed on Pixel phones, but it's the HDR+ capabilities that really set it apart. Thankfully the Android community is full of willing modders, and an unofficial port has been available for some time now. It hasn't played nice with phones that have dual rear lenses, as no Google device has such a setup. A new update looks to have added support for some LG devices with two cameras. </p>

<p> Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold2 5G is now official. Rocking a Z Flip-style redesigned hinge, big folding 7.6" display (augmented by a smaller 6.2" Cover Screen), the phone will come in two colors, potentially including some hinge color customization options, as well as a Thome Browne edition. Reservations for the folding phone/tablet are also now open on Samsung's site. More official details are coming September 1st, together with pre-orders. In the meantime, Max Weinbach has spilled the beans. </p>
<p> Our first good look at Google's upcoming Android TV dongle came courtesy of XDA Developers, and now they're back with more details that were dug up in a leaked firmware image. We knew "Sabrina" would be powered by an unknown Amlogic chipset, but now we know the exact model and most of its specs, as well as features it's likely to support. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/06/02 10:06am PDTon Jun 2, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/03 12:37pm PDTon Jun 3, 2020. </p>
<p> Yesterday, our friends at XDA Developers snagged some renders and marketing images from a leaked video of Google's now long-anticipated Android TV dongle, which might get hardware codename "Sabrina." They've also confirmed that Sabrina will come with a dedicated remote, as was previously rumored. But better than that, they’ve just published a video that includes the new Android TV redesign in action. </p>
<p> Sony's WH-1000XM3 headphones are pretty much the gold standard for over-ear Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones, topping the recommendation lists everywhere, including here. Building upon everything Sony's accomplished (including the derpy name), details surrounding the upcoming WH-1000XM4 have leaked courtesy of a teardown of Sony's Headphones Connect app. </p>
<p> Late last year, Qualcomm told us that GPU updates through the Play Store would be possible, starting with its new Snapdragon 865 chipset. According to XDA Developers, Xiaomi is the first company to have accomplished the feat, rolling out a GPU driver update for its Snapdragon 865-powered devices through its Chinese app store. </p>
<p> Google Play Movies may be gearing up to provide hundreds of movies to viewers for free — assuming they can put up with a few advertisements. The news comes courtesy of an app teardown done by the folks at XDA Developers, and with so many of us both stuck at home and trying to save money during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, it's very good news, assuming it pans out. </p>
<p> You'd be forgiven if you're among the many that forgot the Google Play Games app even exists, but here's a reminder. Better, details surrounding a new "Play Together" social feature have been spotted in a recent teardown, and they could add enough new functionality to make the app worth remembering, too. </p>
<p> Friday afternoon is all about Pixel leaks, it seems like. The folks at XDA Developers just dug up some evidence from that Pixel 4a that previously showed up on video, which indicates Google's next mid-ranger will pack faster UFS 2.1 storage. That will almost certainly be a significant bump in storage speed over the comparatively "slow" eMMC in last year's Pixel 3a. Not all of our readers will be familiar with the differences between these standards, but the short version is: The Pixel 4a could anecdotally feel a lot faster. </p>
<p> More Galaxy S20 details have leaked out today, including basic specs, screen details like 120Hz support (with limits), and even a short hands-on video. XDA's Max Weinbach has just published yet another treasure trove of leaks for Samsung's upcoming phones, joining those from the previous few days as he continues his quest to reveal everything about the Galaxy S20. </p>
<p> XDA's Max Weinbach has been on a roll for the last few days, trickling out a nearly continuous stream of details surrounding Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S20 phones. In addition to showing off the very first photos of the Galaxy S20+ 5G in the wild, he's also dropping nitty-gritty details regarding specs and software. Among the most ridiculous numbers revealed so far is the fact that the higher-end Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G will come in a version with a frankly absurd 16GB of RAM — that's probably more than your laptop. </p>

<p> xe10 </p>
<p> Today Google Glass got its awaited update to XE 10 (explorer edition 10), and it looks like the system image is already up for grabs from Google's developer site. For those who missed our earlier post, XE10 brings transit directions, the ability to click links in notifications, and new visual flare by way of profile photos embedded behind messages or comments. </p>
<p> If you want to grab the update, you're looking at a 343MB download. </p>
<p> Google's just posted up the release notes for the latest monthly Glass update - XE10 - and it brings a few significant new features. First among them is transit directions, which is pretty self-explanatory. Here's what that looks like, along with another new feature, avatars in messages and comments. </p>
<p> Avatars certainly decrease the blandness of the messaging interface, and hey, maybe you forgot who you were messaging and need a visual cue to remember who this person is, or something. </p>

<p> xe12 </p>
<p> Just a few days ago, Google Glass got a hefty update to XE12 with new Glassware, a new (official) wink gesture for taking photos, a lock screen, and other tweaks. </p>
<p> As expected, the Glass team has made the update's system image available for download from the Glass developers website. </p>
<p> The download table has also been given a fresh coat of paint with a new column dedicated to checksums. The update, which weighs in at 344MB can be downloaded by hitting the link below. </p>
<p> Glass has just gotten a nice update to XE12, which besides foretelling the long-awaited iOS app, brings with it new Glassware, gestures, and questions. </p>
<p> Perhaps most important, the update introduces new glassware for Hangouts. Not being able to interact with the service by sending and receiving messages has been an elephant in the room for Glass from the beginning, so it's great to see that compatibility has finally arrived. The glassware will also take over Glass' video call capabilities, and allow users to send photos too. </p>

<p> xe16 </p>
<p> Last week I posted a teardown of the Settings app from XE 16. That was really just a teaser, because this update is huge. This time I'm ripping into the guts of every app on Glass. That's over 100 apks (counting multiple version updates from the last month), and there's plenty to see. I'm not going to waste time on a long intro, you know what you're here for! </p>
<p> It was just last week that the Google Glass team started pushing out eagerly awaited update to XE16. It was followed less than 24 hours later by a silent hotfix dubbed XRE15C. Unfortunately, these updates left many Glass owners with complaints about stability and an even shorter battery life than the device was already known for. Yesterday, in a bid to resolve some of these issues, the team began rolling out a new update to XE16.1. </p>
<p> Two days ago, Google Glass received the XE16 update that bumped the device up to KitKat, introduced photo bundles, brought in sorted voice commands, and added a number of other features. This release was different for a few reasons, the most notable of which being the long wait (the last release was XE12 back in December). </p>
<p> Now the Glass team has released the update's system image to the Internet. The file is available for download from the usual location. </p>

<p> Ever since the unexpected delay between XE12 and XE16, the Glass team has been in a near rapid-fire mode with the OTAs. There were a staggering 5 updates of XE16 in the month of April (6 if you count the 2-parter with XE 12.1) and 3 official versions of XE17 during the month of May. As it turns out, there may be a fourth, unreleased May update to Google's experimental wearable. </p>
<p> Google Glass is receiving an update today - build XE17's release notes just went live on the Google Support site, and they're about as terse as you can get: "XE17 fixes some bugs that caused Glass to unexpectedly restart. Even more improvements are coming soon. Stay tuned." </p>
<p> And that's all she [or he] wrote, folks. The update comes less than a month after XE16 was released, bringing Glass up to Android 4.4, adding photo bundles, sorted voice commands, improved battery life, and more. </p>

<p> xe19.1 </p>
<p> The Google Glass developers are at it again; they keep coming up with new ways to burn through that tiny battery. Today, the Glass Development Kit changelog was updated to detail the addition of USB webcam support for developers looking to add access to views outside of the standard forward-facing perspective. Webcams must be attached via On-The-Go (OTG) cable, and Plug 'n Play isn't supported, so Glass must be rebooted before the attached camera can be recognized. </p>
<p> A minor OTA update is now rolling out to the small population of people who happen to own Google Glass. This release, XE19.1, brings improved network connectivity, so Glass should now do a better job of handling spotty network issues when issuing voice commands. This is good considering how much Google's voice search relies on the web. </p>
<p> XE19.1 also brings in a slight visual revamp, as Glass now has a cleaner look for voice actions. </p>

<p> XE5 </p>
<p> Man, Google Glass moves at the speed of light. This is crazy. </p>
<p> The big XE5 update just hit the interwebs, so that means it's time for a teardown! XE5 is still Android 4.0.4 based, but now we're up to build 4.0.4-665738; the old version was 4.0.4-625737. </p>
<p> The Glass Team is still extraordinarily messy; any new file usually has copies in a million different locations. Basically, everything ships in every APK. </p>
<p> Have you tried finding a Glass system dump? It's impossible. A Google search turns up the same thing, over and over again: Me, talking about system dumps or begging for one. </p>
<p> So, to rectify this great injustice of the Internet (and because people keep asking me, personally) we've decided to hit you up with the Glass system dump. The Explorer program seems to be all about hacking and experimentation, so hopefully Google adopts an open policy towards posting Glass code. </p>
<p> Wow. So when Glass was first making the rounds, we heard a few rumblings about a ridiculously fast update cycle; something like monthly updates. Sure enough, it seems like Google is delivering on that sort-of rumored promise: </p>
<p> Today, less than a month after the Glass unit left Google HQ, there's a new update: Version XE5. There's no public change log, but Phandroid says they emailed Google and got back the following list: </p>
<p> New features in XE5: </p>
<p> Change to sync policy: require power + wifi for background uploads </p>
<p> Crash reporting </p>
<p> Incoming G+ notifications (direct shares, comments, +mentions), including ability to comment and +1 </p>
<p> Incoming Hangout notifications </p>
<p> Transcription of queries & messages is now wicked-fast </p>
<p> Long-press to search from anywhere in the UI (no longer just from off) </p>
<p> International number dialing + SMS </p>
<p> New On-Head Detection calibration flow </p>
<p> Show device Serial Number on Device Info card </p>
<p> More reliable estimation of battery charge remaining </p>
<p> New recipient-list mosaic </p>
<p> Google+ integration sounds awesome; the only problem is it doesn't actually work right now. </p>

<p> Xfinity subscribers have a reason to get excited. Nope, Comcast's still running things — sorry. But Chromecast support for Xfinity streaming content is now rolling out. It's already live on the web, and now it has started rolling out via a beta program update for the Android app as well. Chromecast streaming even works for live TV. </p>

<p> After having an early run elsewhere around the world, Samsung is preparing to inundate the U.S. market with a half-dozen lower-cost smartphones this year — including the company's first cut-price 5G phones. Two of those phones are launching tomorrow: the Galaxy A01 and the Galaxy A51. </p>
<p> Comcast subscribers lost the option to set DVR recordings remotely after the company's failed legal battle against TiVo back in 2017, leaving customers without a convenient way to schedule and monitor their recordings away from their TV. More than two years later, the entertainment conglomerate has finally managed to add back DVR functionality to the Xfinity app and web service. </p>
<p> After distributing its beta version to American S9 and S9+ devices at the end of November and updating international versions of the phone earlier this month, Samsung is now releasing Android 9 Pie and One UI to Comcast’s Xfinity S9s. That's a bit of a coup for Xfinity, as we're not accustomed to seeing a smaller carrier's version updated first, especially not before unlocked handsets. </p>
<p> Two Movies Anywhere tidbits for you today, including its addition to Comcast's Xfinity and support for 4K streaming in the Android app. Subscribers with Xfinity On Demand or the Xfinity Stream app will now be able to take advantage of the huge catalog of blockbuster films. </p>
<p> Using a single router is so 2014. Now, everyone is into mesh WiFi systems like Eero and Google Wifi. Not to be outdone, Comcast has its own mesh system that connects to the Xfinity Internet Gateway. The new xFi Pods are now available as a three-pack for $119. </p>
<p> Comcast's switch from XFINITY TV to XFINITY Stream about a year ago was met with lots of criticism for a number of reasons, and based on the latest Google Store reviews, users still aren't very happy. But here's something that might cheer you up: fingerprint authentication has been added for parental controls. </p>
<p> Over a year ago, Comcast revealed that it was working on an Xfinity app for Android TV. It was part of the 'Xfinity TV Partner Program,' designed to make its television service available on smart TVs and internet-connected streaming boxes. That way, you wouldn't have to lease a cable box (unless you didn't want TV congesting your home internet network) - just install the app and start watching content. </p>
<p> Changing your network settings, especially on a per-device basis, isn't easily possible unless you have a newer router - like the Google Wifi. For Xfinity customers using one of the standard Wireless Gateways, you could change basic settings from the Xfinity Account app, but not much else. Now Comcast has released a new app, xFi, that gives customers far greater control over their home network. </p>
<p> Comcast is doing what Comcast does best: making its monopolized customers really, really hate the company. That's just Comcast's general state of being, but in this specific sense, it's all about the streaming cable TV app for Android. As promised, the former XFINITY TV app has been replaced with the all-new, all-different XFINITY Stream. </p>

It's already live on the web, and now it has started rolling out via a beta program update for the Android app as well. Chromecast streaming even works for live TV. </p>
<p> Comcast's Xfinity Stream app, one of the cable company's main plays for a digital audience, offers customers access to live TV and on demand content (plus DVR recordings, for X1 or Instant TV Cloud subscribers), from their Android, iOS or Amazon device. In the recent 5.0 update to the platform, the company added the ability to watch and download rentals to the app, as well as the option to rent and buy directly through the app. A few other upgrades came along with 5.0 as well, but so far the update hasn't stemmed the poor to middling reviews for the service. </p>

<p> Comcast is doing what Comcast does best: making its monopolized customers really, really hate the company. That's just Comcast's general state of being, but in this specific sense, it's all about the streaming cable TV app for Android. As promised, the former XFINITY TV app has been replaced with the all-new, all-different XFINITY Stream. </p>
<p> While Google I/O is all the rage on our side of the internetz, another conference is taking place that is probably a lot less exciting for us: INTX, the Internet and Television Expo. But one interesting nugget has escaped INTX and found its place on our radar as Android users and it's about Comcast, of all evil companies and things. </p>
<p> Last month, Comcast had announced the Xfinity TV Partner program, an initiative aimed to make the Xfinity TV app available to smart TVs, and TV-connected and IP-enabled devices (read: other set-top boxes) without the requirement for a Comcast set-top box. Think of this as Comcast wanting to be Netflix'ish, ie available to you through an app and with a subscription, no need to call the company and lease a physical box from it. </p>
<p> It wouldn't be controversial to say that the interfaces for cable boxes suck. With the possible exception of TiVo, I don't think I've ever seen one that was made for the purpose of being easy and/or efficient to use, especially since the newer ones are more interested in selling Pay-Per-View and on demand content than actually letting you watch TV. That has largely carried over to the remote apps for the fancy new cable boxes, which might help explain why the XFINITY remote app has a 3.2-star rating in the Play Store. </p>
<p> New above, old below. </p>
<p> Version 2.0 of the XFINITY TV Remote app is different. </p>
<p> Comcast's XFINITY app has undergone a name change with its latest update, and it now only answers when referred to as XFINITY TV Go. Does the latest version, in fact, make TV go? If we're referring to live content, then the answer's yes. Comcast customers with an Android device or two lying around can now stream the news, sports, kids shows, and other content live. </p>
<p> Live streaming works on both cellular and Wi-Fi data, which means you are not tied to your own home network as was the case with some apps in the past. Here are the live channels available on our devices: CNN, FOX, HLN, MSNBC, CNBC, FOX Business, BBC World News, Watch ESPN, NBC Sports, FOX Sports 1, Golf Channel, BTN, PAC 12, beIN Sport, Willow, FX, FXX, Nat Geo, and Nat Geo Wild. </p>
<p> If you're a Comcast subscriber, there's a good chance you're already using the Xfinity TV Player app. The problem is, though, if you're not around a Wi-Fi connection and want to watch something, you're just out of luck. Well, you were out of luck anyway - the app was just updated to allow certain content to be downloaded and viewed offline. That's awesome. </p>
<p> Among the downloadable content, you'll find TV Shows and movies from Showtime, Starz, Encore, and MoviePlex. Sure, it's not a huge list, but it's a good start - and more offline content than before. </p>
<p> The update also brings "enhanced support for varied device sizes and orientations," so if you've had issues with the app on device x in the past, you may want to give it another shot. </p>
<p> Leave it to Comcast to be ahead of the curve on keeping up to date with new technology*. The Comcast subsidiary Xfinity has just updated its TV Player app to be compatible with Android 4.1, with special emphasis on supporting the Nexus 7. The app is technically compatible, though the release notes say that the next version of the app will include a UI designed specifically for the 7" form factor. </p>
<p> While Xfinity probably isn't the first company to announce plans for or produce a 7"-specific UI for an app on the Play Store, it does highlight yet again the beginning of the trend we all knew was coming since I/O: 7" form factors are going to be a beast unto themselves. </p>
<p> Today, we move yet another teeny tiny step forward to the truly digital future of television. Xfinity has launched the XFINITY TV Player which, aside from a name that's needlessly yelling, gives Comcast/Xfinity subscribers access to a host of television and movies on their Android 2.3+ devices. Both phones and tablets are supported. </p>
<p> The app supports Streampix, so for those of you who sprung for the extra $5/month service, this will give you access to that content, consolidated with all of the other available content on the service, including XFINITY On Demand. The app also looks great, with a proper separate phone and tablet UI, as you can see above. </p>
<p> The XFINITY TV app for Android saw its first update in many months back in February, which brought many useful features to XFINITY customers. While the update was accepted with open arms by most XFINITY users, one group was still left out in the cold: users with Ice Cream Sandwich-powered devices. </p>
<p> At the time ICS support was said to be "coming soon," which apparently translates into a little over a month in developer speak, as the update finally hit the Play Store just a little while ago. </p>
<p> The update doesn't actually bring much aside from support for ICS phones and tablets - just "minor bug fixes" according to the changelog. </p>
<p> Comcast's XFINITY TV for Android got updated today after more than half a year of silence. The app, which allows XFINITY customers to control their cable boxes and DVRs, received the following additions and tweaks with version 1.4.1.002 (up from 1.2.0.005): </p>
<p> We now automatically detect your channel lineup. That means no more fussing with having to select your zip code and lineup before using the app. </p>
<p> Select your favorite channels in the TV listing grid to make it easier to find what you want to watch. </p>
<p> Use the new keypad to change channels from the TV listings grid. </p>
<p> View and tune to the last few channels you watched. </p>
<p> Earlier today, Comcast dropped its 2nd mobile app for Android into the Android Market, the direction of which puzzled even me - and I work for a Comcast-owned company. The new app, XFINITY TV, is clearly targeted at TV viewers, while the previous app called XFINITY Mobile was a more general application for address book management, SmartZone email, Digital Voice, and... TV, DVR, and On Demand. </p>
<p> Wait, what? Did Comcast just release a separate app that does pretty much the same thing its existing app that's been on the Market for a few months does plus a tiny bit more? Let's see - both apps let you: </p>
<p> browse local TV listings </p>
<p> schedule DVR recordings and </p>
<p> fiddle with On Demand </p>
<p> The only things the new XFINITY TV app has that the previous app doesn't have seem to be: </p>
<p> changing channels on your TV (forgot your remote?) </p>

<p> XFINITY TV GO </p>
<p> The Xfinity TV Go is Comcast's way of letting customers take some of the channels they're already paying for and stream them to an Android device. For something that doesn't cost extra—thankfully, considering the high price of cable—it's a nice perk. Comcast has recently brought the list of supported channels up to over 70 with the addition of AMC, BBC America, FOX Deportes, MOVIEPLEX, Showtime, Univision Deportes, and The Weather Channel. The full list is available to browse through online. </p>
<p> For people who have a Comcast cable subscription, the Xfinity TV Go app is quite the nice piece of software. Rather than just providing shows for immediate streaming, which is less groundbreaking these days than it used to be, Comcast provides quite a few channels for live streaming. Now many more networks are available, including A&E, Cooking Channel, DIY, Food Network, HGTV, History Channel, MUN2 (companion to Telemundo), Sprout, Starz, TBS, TRUtv, TNT, and the Travel Channel. </p>

<p> xgels </p>
<p> Most Xposed modules add a simple change or tweak one or two settings. The Xposed GEL Settings module, colloquially known as XGELS, is a bit more ambitious. This tool for customizing the default Google Experience Launcher keeps adding new features every few months, and the latest actually adds something that isn't available in erstwhile competitors like Nova or Apex. You can download it on the Play Store now, though you'll need root and the Xposed Framework to run it. </p>
<p> Xposed GEL Settings, or XGELS, is an Xposed Framework module that aims to make the default Google Now launcher (AKA the Google Experience Launcher) just as customizable as alternatives like Nova. The latest update adds a handful of new options for customization nuts, including tweaks to the icon display on the homescreen and app drawer. You can download XGELS via the Play Store, but you'll need a rooted device and the Xposed Framework (sideload) to make it work. </p>
<p> Google's official Google Now Launcher is pretty cool, but it's lacking the settings you'd find in Nova and other third-party launchers. There's a way to fix that if you're rooted with Xposed, though. Xposed GEL Settings (or XGELS to its friends) is an app that adds features to GNL so you can have the best of both worlds. This app just hit v2.0 and it's packing some new goodies. </p>
<p> I don't think the developer behind the Xposed Google Experience Launcher Settings (XGELS) module will be satisfied until he's made the stock Google Search launcher every bit as flexible as Nova and Apex. The latest update to the popular module adds even more customization options. Premium users can now assign custom icons to a single app or the app drawer icon, with or without a full icon theme applied, like most of the more advanced launchers allow. </p>
<p> A Google Search update is usually an occasion to celebrate – not only do we get new Google Now cards, but the Google Now Launcher can also be augmented with new features and tweaks. But all was not well when Google Search 3.4 rolled out. Users of the popular Xposed GEL Settings Module (XGELS) found that it no longer worked. The developer was pessimistic at first, but now it's back. </p>

<p> XGIMI MoGo </p>
<p> Summer is here, which means kicking off your shoes, relaxing outdoors, and exploring new places... hopefully while still social distancing. If you want to take your entertainment with you on the go, a portable projector is a great all-in-one solution, but you need something that's bright, works well with a remote, supports apps, and has some decent sound. Those are all qualities I enjoyed about the Xgimi projectors when I reviewed them last year, and now three of the brands' models are discounted up to 25% as Amazon's deals of the day. </p>
<p> Portable projectors have been the fantasy of entertainment enthusiasts for decades. Over the past years, the image quality, tech, and price have become better and more reasonable, but most devices either run a sloppy OS or don't run one at all. If you want a TV-centric platform on your portable projector, you should consider this XGIMI MoGo projector, which comes with Android TV and is now down from $400 to $340 on Amazon. </p>
<p> Until recently, most portable projectors either ran no software at all, relying on HDMI and USB for input, or offered a regular version of Android that wasn't suited for TVs or navigation with a remote. Then Anker's Nebula Capsule II launched with Android TV and the game changed drastically. It was the first projector to provide a seamless experience thanks to an optimized interface made specifically for TVs and official access to the Play Store. </p>
<p> XGIMI, a projector maker, is now dipping its toes in the same market with the new MoGo. With Android TV, Google Assistant, Harman Kardon audio, 210 ANSI Lumens, and an appealing price tag, the MoGo has everything going for it, but you should keep an eye open for a few quirks. </p>

<p> Now that more people are staying at home these days, augmented reality has the potential to become even more important. AR may not be as novel as it once was, but that doesn't mean Google isn't continually expanding its ARCore SDK to more devices to enable them to seamlessly access AR experiences like its virtual zoo. </p>
<p> Fast charging has been one of the key battlegrounds in the smartphone wars in recent years, and Xiaomi has often been at the forefront. Last year, the Chinese OEM announced that it was working on a 100W wired charger that could fully fill a 4,000mAh battery in just 17 minutes. It's now going one step further with 80W Mi Wireless Charging that takes almost as little time to do the same job sans wires. </p>
<p> Xiaomi’s been busy this year. In addition to launching a plethora of Xiaomi and Redmi-branded phones, the company’s turned Poco into its own sub-brand, starting with the Poco X2 in February, followed by the Poco F2 Pro in May, Poco M2 Pro in July, plus the Poco X3 NFC and Poco M2 in September. What started off as a single, $300 handset with flagship specs in 2018 — the Poco F1 (or Pocophone F1) — is now an entire product line. </p>
<p> Granted, Xiaomi’s mostly re-branding Redmi devices here, with Poco handsets getting a few hardware and software tweaks like unique memory and storage configurations, and a bespoke launcher. </p>
<p> Ever since the US tightened the noose on Huawei with various extensions of the trade ban, the Chinese manufacturer is in deep trouble, potentially left off without vital phone components. That appears to be the reason why the company might be working on restructuring its business and refocus its efforts on its own higher-end lineup. Reuters reports that Huawei is looking to sell parts of its subdivision Honor to Digital China, Xiaomi, or TCL. </p>
<p> Xiaomi spin-off Poco has been intensely engaged with Oppo spin-off Realme in a budget smartphone pricing war in India. Its latest salvo comes in the form of a Rs. 10,000 device called the Poco C3 featuring formidable core specs to enable quality gaming at a new price tier. There are, though, a few trade-offs to have made this product possible. </p>
<p> Xiaomi is known for its cheap phones, whether they come under its own brand name or its Redmi and Poco sub-brands. Its devices provide great hardware with decent software support for pretty low prices. Today, the company is launching 3 new phones in the Mi 10T series, the Mi 10T, Mi 10T Pro, and Mi 10T Lite. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/08/13 10:21am PDTon Aug 13, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/30 6:32am PDTon Sep 30, 2020. </p>
<p> One of the very first Xiaomi devices to officially land in the US was the Mi Box (known as the Mi Box 3 elsewhere) back in fall 2016. While the original model has already been replaced by the Mi Box S in the States, Xiaomi hasn’t stopped pushing newer updates to its nearly four-year-old box. Now the company's rolling out Android 9 Pie to those enrolled in the beta program. </p>
<p> While most of us know Xiaomi for its extensive smartphone lineup, it maintains an even bigger ecosystem of IoT products back home. Looking specifically at smart speakers, Xiaomi does have a bunch on offer, but they all use a local voice assistant that only speaks Chinese. One of those speakers is now making an international debut as the Mi Smart Speaker with Google Assistant and Chromecast on board. </p>

<p> Xiaomi's Mi Band series has won fans by offering a lot of fitness features for not a lot of money. That formula isn't changing with the latest entry, the Mi Band 5. It looks almost identical to its predecessors but makes some notable improvements: There's finally magnetic charging so you don't have to pry the device out of the band anymore, the screen is a little bigger, and the tracking is a bit more accurate. </p>
<p> The Mi Band 5 might not compete with high-end trackers and smartwatches from Garmin or Fitbit, but it doesn’t have to. </p>
<p> Almost exactly two years ago, Xiaomi pulled a page from OnePlus’ playbook and stunned everyone with the Poco F1 (or Pocophone F1), a phone with proper flagship specs that cost just $300. While the F1 cut some corners to achieve this feat (plastic build, no NFC), it still delivered amazing performance and battery life. Then in 2019, it was followed up by… crickets? </p>
<p> While Redmi’s excellent K20 Pro was technically the Poco F1’s successor, Xiaomi didn’t release a Poco-branded device last year. That changed back in February 2020, when the company announced it was spinning Poco off as a sub-brand. </p>

<p> On many Android devices, Google Search lets you view tons of 3D models like animals, pets, skeletons, cells, Neil Armstrong's spacesuit, and much more. With the tap of a button, you can move these objects into your home and see them as though they were in your camera's viewfinder. It's even possible to snap photos and take videos. The list of supported phones is ever-expanding — devices like the Sony Xperia 1 II, the Poco X2, the Xiaomi Redmi K30, and Samsung's Galaxy Tab S6 Lite made the cut we when checked in at the beginning of June, and now a few more are popping up, including the flagship Galaxy S20 series. </p>

<p> The popular Energy Ring app, which gives you a pretty ingenious and fun battery indicator around the so-called "punch-hole" camera cutout, was just updated with support for twelve new phones, including two technically unreleased ones.

<p> xiaomi mi 5 </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Mi 5 is a phone that, statistically, most of you probably will not be able to buy through official channels if you read this website. While it will be available in two massive markets - namely, China and India - the rest of the world will once again be sitting on the sidelines for the launch of Xiaomi's latest and greatest low-cost but powerful mass-market smartphone. Xiaomi is expected to expand its list of markets at some point with the Mi 5, but the general assumption is that expansion will still be restricted to Asia or other emerging markets for the time being. </p>
<p> We had a chance to quickly go hands-on with the Xiaomi Mi 5 at MWC directly after its announcement this morning, and I know what your first question is: will I even be able to buy one? Answer: probably not. Xiaomi said China and India would be launch markets with "some other countries" following down the road, but if the company planned to make a big to do of opening up new markets for their hardware, I have a feeling they'd have made a lot more noise at this launch. </p>
<p> With that said, should you want one, even knowing you probably won't be able to through anything but 3rd-party retailers (and likely with non-functional 4G)? </p>
<p> Despite not much of a western presence, Xiaomi is rapidly becoming one of the largest phone manufacturers in the world. At Mobile World Congress, the company has unveiled its new flagship product: the Xiaomi Mi 5. </p>

<p> xiaomi mi 6 </p>
<p> A long time coming at this point, but Oreo is rolling out to Xiaomi's early-2017 flagship. In addition to the Android version bump, this update brings along a whole slew of new features, fixes, and optimizations – all under MIUI 9 – for the Mi 6. </p>
<p> Xiaomi has an interesting history that I recommend you read up on if you don’t already know it. The company, while known to mostly enthusiasts here in the States, has a huge presence in its homeland China, as well as India and other parts of Southeast Asia. Despite a general decline in size and influence in the past year or two, Xiaomi continues to push the envelope of affordable, feature-packed phones. The Mi line represents the best that the manufacturer has to offer. For 2017, Xiaomi has created the Mi 6, a small phone full of the latest and greatest specs. </p>
<p> As great as LineageOS and other ROMs are, they wouldn't be possible without a custom recovery available for the device. TWRP is usually pretty quick to support new devices, with older phones and tablets being added to the list frequently too. Since our last post, TWRP has added support for 17 more devices, including the LeEco Le Pro 3 and Xiaomi Mi 6. </p>
<p> After a lot of speculation, leaks, and plenty of teasing, Xiaomi has officially unveiled its latest flagship, the Mi 6. The Chinese company packed in some top-tier specs into a small-bodied, glass sandwich phone, with an attractive price to boot. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi 8 Explorer Edition </p>
<p> A few months back, Xiaomi attracted attention for the transparent Xiaomi Mi 8 Explorer Edition. Of course, it wasn't all positive attention. The phone has an improbable window on the back with components neatly arranged in a grid. We were skeptical from the start because that's not how real circuit boards look, and now a picture of the actual component confirms this is just a fake model of a PCB. </p>
<p> Xiaomi announced some new phones today, which I'm sure will sell in huge numbers (just not in the US). Among the new devices was the Xiaomi Mi 8 Explorer Edition. This phone is like the regular M8 except it has a transparent glass back that shows off suspiciously pretty internal components. Really, there's a little Snapdragon logo on what purports to be the SoC. This could all be smoke and mirrors. </p>

<p> xiaomi mi 9 </p>
<p> If you don't have a Pixel phone to get into that sweet, sweet Android Q Beta business, you've got more than a dozen third-party phones that can help you get there. But with each phone comes its own catches, so we'll patch you through to the resources you need from the OEMs. </p>
<p> Last year's Xiaomi Mi 8 Explorer Edition received widespread attention for its transparent back, which offered a look inside at the phone's motherboard and processor. As many suspected, the layer underneath the transparent case turned out to be a fake board sitting on top of the real hardware components. The Mi 9 is due soon, and it looks like Xiaomi is preparing a transparent version of that phone as well. </p>
<p> The upcoming announcement of the Mi 9 is no secret at this point – it'll actually be revealed on the same day as the Galaxy S10 – but Xiaomi's CEO took to Weibo and Twitter to show off some hi-resolution renders of his company's upcoming flagship. Though this is usually the case with final renders, the Mi 9 looks quite snazzy. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi A1 </p>
<p> A couple of months ago, my brother in law came to me with a question: he needed an affordable $200-300 Android smartphone that he could purchase from the UAE or Lebanon and that would do the basics right. My ready-made answer in the category in the past few years has been Samsung's A/C/J series. You get nice hardware, decent software with less bloat nowadays, excellent after-sale support no matter which mom-and-pop repair store you stop at, easy accessory purchase, and it's super fast to sell it on when the time comes to part with your phone. But that's only because Samsung's presence in Lebanon is huge, LG's midrange devices are too costly for the features, Moto and HTC essentially don't exist, Nokia/HMD hadn't begun selling phones again yet, and Huawei started breaking into the market about a year or so ago. </p>
<p> Xiaomi's mixed record for releasing kernel sources continues, as the company has still not posted sources for the Mi A1. While Xiaomi has previously stated their internal goal for releasing kernels is "within three months," according to XDA-Developers, the Mi A1 is well past this mark, as it was released last September. With the apparent end of the Nexus device program, the Mi A1 would be a prime candidate for custom ROM development, in place of the 2+ year old Nexus 5X. </p>
<p> The Mi A1 was the first Android One device from Xiaomi, meaning it ran completely stock Android. It turned out to be an excellent phone, and Xiaomi promised it would receive Oreo before the end of 2017. It looks like the company just barely delivered on that promise, because Android 8.0 is now rolling out to the device. </p>
<p> Team Win Recovery Project, or TWRP for short, is just about the only custom recovery worth using in 2017. It does everything most people need, works on a massive number of devices, and can be themed. The last time we covered TWRP, it added support for the Pixel 2 and a few other phones. Now the recovery is officially available for some of ASUS' new phones, and Xiaomi's first Android One device. </p>
<p> Xiaomi phones always have the same problem. While the company's devices have generally great specifications and design for the price, the software experience is usually not very good. If you've read one of our Xiaomi device reviews, or used one of the company's phones yourself, you probably know what I'm talking about. </p>
<p> All of Xiaomi's phones and tablets ship with MIUI, a heavily modified version of Android that has countless problems. Some of these include Bluetooth connectivity bugs, terrible notification handling, and over-the-top power management that can outright break notifications for many apps. Jordan went in depth about MIUI's issues here, if you're interested in details. </p>
<p> We haven't heard a lot from Android One lately, but it seems that the program is catching on in several countries like Japan and Turkey. You can add India to that list, as well as several dozens other countries thanks to the announcement of the new Xiaomi Mi A1. </p>
<p> Xiaomi had teased a new "flagship dual camera" on Twitter a few days ago, and just like the rumors predicted, this is the Mi A1, the latest Android One (A1, geddit?) phone. And I have to say, Xiaomi pulled all the stops there. It's an impressive device for an impressive little price. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi A2 </p>
<p> Very few smartphone makers can eke out as much value from a device as Xiaomi. We often look at the company's line-up and wonder how small its margins must be if it can delivery such high specs at such low prices. This is especially true of the low-end and mid-range market, where others scramble to offer minimum usable specs and Xiaomi's devices are impressively better. </p>
<p> But for the longest time, recommending Xiaomi's products outside of its foothold markets of China, India, and South East Asia, had been difficult. You couldn't find them easily so you'd had to purchase from an untrusted source and gamble with future support in case something went wrong with the hardware, plus the Android interface felt more tailored toward the Eastern markets than the Western ones. </p>

<p> xiaomi mi a3 </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/08 7:16am PDTon Apr 8, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/08 2:33am PDTon May 8, 2020. </p>
<p> You would think that Android One phones are usually among the first to get new OS releases, but many Nokia devices and the Xiaomi Mi A3 prove this wrong, as a lot of them still run Android 9 to this day. That's bound to change for the Mi A3, though, as Xiaomi has started to roll out Android 10 to the handset. </p>
<p> Google is always hard at work on adding ARCore support to new devices. This time around, those include the brand-new Note10 and 10+, but other than that, a bigger shift has occurred on the company's AR front – that is, if you count marketing and naming schemes as big shifts. The catchy ARCore Play Store listing makes way for the cumbersome phrase "Google Play Service for AR." The change has already been visible for a while, but the company only introduced the new name in the app's changelog last week, along with announcing support for 60fps rendering on capable devices. </p>
<p> Xiaomi's first stock Android device was the Mi A1, released back in 2017. It was a very good phone, especially for the low price of ~$230, and the company released a sequel last year. There wasn't much doubt that a Mi A3 was on the way, but now we have the first pictures of the device. </p>

<p> Xiaomi's Mi Band series has won fans by offering a lot of fitness features for not a lot of money. That formula isn't changing with the latest entry, the Mi Band 5. It looks almost identical to its predecessors but makes some notable improvements: There's finally magnetic charging so you don't have to pry the device out of the band anymore, the screen is a little bigger, and the tracking is a bit more accurate. </p>
<p> The Mi Band 5 might not compete with high-end trackers and smartwatches from Garmin or Fitbit, but it doesn’t have to. </p>
<p> Xiaomi managed to impress everybody with its low-cost $30 Mi Band 4 that easily kept up with much costlier products from Fitbit, Garmin, and Co. (as long as you're not a swimmer, that is). Exactly a year after its introduction, the company has released a follow-up in the form of the Mi Band 5, packing a slightly bigger screen, a much-improved charger, more tracking capabilities, and a ton of new animated watchfaces. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/xiaomi-mi-box-s/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17555630" filename="xiaomi-mi-box-s">
<p> If you own an Android TV set-top box that wasn't made by NVIDIA, there are decent odds that you're using a Mi Box from Xiaomi. This affordable alternative manages to play 4K HDR content at up to 60 FPS for far less than the $150 asking price of NVIDIA's cheapest option. While updates for the Mi Box S haven't exactly been numerous, the device recently received an update to a stable build of Android 9 Pie, and now a major bugfix update is on its way. </p>
<p> When you think Android TV Box, you might think Nvidia Shield TV right away, but the company best known for its graphics cards isn't the only one offering a capable big screen experience for Android. Xiaomi's Mi Box S is a neat little device outputting 4K HDR to your TV, and it's on sale at Walmart, going for only $30. That's the lowest we've ever seen and $5 less than the recent offer of $35. </p>
<p> In case you forgot, Nvidia isn't the only game in town when it comes to Android TV. Xiaomi offers a much more affordable option in its Mi Box S — and that device just became a more appealing alternative thanks to an official Android 9 Pie beta program. </p>
<p> When it comes to Android TV streaming boxes, there are really only two options: the Nvidia Shield TV, and if you're not playing games, the Xiaomi Mi Box S. Now you can grab the entry-level Xiaomi box for just $35, a drop of $25 from the original MSRP (though it has gone for $40 a few times in recent history). </p>
<p> Xiaomi's new Mi Box S was announced just last month, in unison with Google's Pixel 3 reveal, at the reasonable price of $60. That price got even more reasonable recently when Walmart offered the Mi Box S and Google Home Mini as a bundle for $85 — a savings of $24 altogether. Now, for Black Friday, the big box retailer is discounting the gadget even further. </p>
<p> Xiaomi announced the Mi Box S on October 9, on the same day as Google's Pixel 3 et al. announcements. This new Android TV box from the company keeps its cheap pricing, but you wouldn't say no to more savings, would you? In that case, you can now grab the Mi Box S along with a Home Mini for $24 off the total price of both. </p>
<p> While Google was busy announcing new phones, tablets, and other gadgets, Xiaomi unveiled its new Android TV box. The Mi Box 4 and 4c launched in China earlier this year, and now the company has announced an international version with Android TV - the Mi Box S. </p>

<p> In late August, Google updated its list of devices that support ARCore with an addition of 28 new phones including Google's brand-new Pixel 4a, the LG Velvet 5G, Moto G8 Power Lite and G Pro, Vivo X50 and X50 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy A20, A20s, A30s, and Z Flip 5G, among a whole lot more. This time, the company's once again topped up the list with eight more. </p>
<p> Xiaomi and Samsung have been teasing a new 108MP camera module for quite some time now and shared that they're working together to bring the first 100MP+ phone to the market. This device has now been introduced as the Xiaomi Mi CC9 Pro. Other than the 108MP sensor, it sports four more lenses on its back, making it look almost as ridiculous as the Nokia 9 PureView. The phone is coming to international markets as the Mi Note 10. </p>

<p> Last month, Xiaomi took the stage in an online-only event to show off a slew of products, including its Redmi 9 phone series and its new true wireless earbuds. Among them was also the hotly anticipated and often-leaked Mi TV Stick, which the company has now finally released in India, where it will become available for purchase starting August 7. </p>
<p> Xiaomi's new Android TV device, the Mi TV Stick, has already been leaked several times. Now there is absolutely nothing left to the imagination (besides official US pricing), because unboxing photos and hands-on videos have been published. </p>
<p> Almost every detail about Xiaomi's upcoming budget Android TV device, the Mi TV Stick, has already been leaked in one way or another. The hardware was confirmed by Google earlier this month, but now the stick has been approved by the United States FCC, and a listing for it has appeared on Xiaomi's own Portuguese store. </p>
<p> For years, the Xiaomi Mi Box (and its various iterations) has been the go-to option for a cheap Android TV device. Google is finally producing its own Android TV streaming stick, nicknamed 'Sabrina,' but that isn't stopping Xiaomi from working on a sequel to the Mi Box — the aptly-named Mi TV Stick. </p>
<p> During a live event announcing the Redmi Note 9 series in Germany, Xiaomi offered a first glimpse at its long-rumored Mi TV Stick. Other than the image above and the orally delivered slogan "for a better and simpler TV experience," no further details have been given, though these tidbits already help us guess quite a few things about the device. </p>

<p> Xiaomi / MIUI </p>
<p> In China, Xiaomi's custom Android interface MIUI 11 has been in beta since last month, and now the company is ready to deploy its software to more locations internationally. The MIUI India Twitter account posted an animation featuring the new interface along with the date October 16. We can expect the international version of the UI to start rolling out then. </p>
<p> MIUI, one of Android's most popular custom ROM flavors, has been limited to purely software for existing devices... until today. Made by a Chinese company Xiaomi which has been in charge of MIUI's software development, the MIUI phone was just announced in China (where Xiaomi is based), and I must say - it's no hush puppy and leaves us highly impressed. </p>
<p> First and foremost, the MI-ONE, or Millet, sports a whopping 1.5GHz dual-core MSM8260 Scorpion CPU (from the 3rd generation Snapdragon family). </p>
<p> Dissecting the beefy specs further, we find the Adreno220 GPU, 4GB of ROM and 1GB of RAM, a 4" Sharp screen (854x480 - not qHD), 8MP rear camera, and a juicy 1930mAh battery. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Poco F1 </p>
<p> Energy Notch (from the developer behind Energy Ring and Energy Bar) may only be a week old, but already the developer has added support for a handful of new phones. Folks with a OnePlus 6, OnePlus 7, OnePlus 7T, Xiaomi POCO F1, Redmi Note 7/S, or Motorola One Power can now get in on that notched battery indicator action. </p>
<p> Xiaomi's Poco F1 has had an Android 10 beta in testing for more than a month already, and it looks like the company is finally ready to take the software to stable. In a forum post, it has announced that it will start rolling out the latest version of the OS globally, and the first owners report that they are indeed receiving the update. </p>
<p> Last month, a tweet by Poco's global head Alvin Tse led to speculation that the Pocophone F2 might launch sometime in 2020. Now, we have concrete evidence that the device is on its way, thanks to a recently discovered trademark application. </p>
<p> Xiaomi's Poco F1 has been turning plenty of heads with its incredible price tag, piquing our collective curiosity here at Android Police. If you want an early look at what the Poco F1 is like, Xiaomi's launcher for the phone just showed up on the Play Store. Unfortunately, the early access program has run out of space. But thanks to the magic of APK Mirror, you can still try it out for yourself. </p>
<p> Every month or so, an update to ARCore rolls out to add the augmented reality framework to a whole new set of phones, tablets... and now Chromebooks? Yes, the first Chrome OS device has been found among the list of profiles included in the ARCore APK, and that is the recently released Acer Chromebook Tab 10. Also joining the list are the codenames associated with the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, blueline and crosshatch, which are due out this Fall. </p>

<p> The last time we covered LineageOS, the project had started supporting seven new phones, including the Xperia Z5 Compact and LG K10. Since then, several additional devices have been added to the official build roster. These include the Sony Xperia Z5, Samsung Galaxy S6, and Redmi 3S/3X. </p>
<p> Forget about those damn Pixel 2 phones. Did you get a shiny new Galaxy Note8 and were you itching to install a custom recovery just so you can make your life easier with custom ROMs and flashing various things on it? Then you want TWRP and TWRP is delivering. Well, at least for the Exynos version. Qualcomm variants need not apply, yet. </p>
<p> You can grab TWRP for the Exynos Galaxy Note8 (greatlte), but it's not the only device that's added TWRP support recently. Also on the list are the Xiaomi Redmi 3S/Prime/3X (land), the Xiaomi Redmi 4A (rolex), the ZUK Edge (z2x), (update) and the Elephone P9000 (p9000). </p>

<p> While flagships are getting ever more expensive, midrange and entry-level phones are giving us ever better hardware at the same affordable prices. The Xiaomi Redmi 9 is no exception and offers great value at €150 (or ₹10,000 as the Redmi 9 Prime in India). If Xiaomi had invested more in a better processor and less in the heavily-marketed but poorly executed quad-camera setup, I could recommend this phone with no reservations. As it stands, this phone is still a good option for some people. </p>
<p> Xiaomi introduced a plethora of products in an online-only event today, including the much-leaked Mi TV Stick and a new pair of wireless earbuds, but the company also launched a new lineup of budget phones, the Redmi 9 series. It consists of three devices costing between €100 and €170, the Redmi 9, the Redmi 9A, and the Redmi 9C. They all come with 6.53-inch screens and are powered by MediaTek silicon. </p>

<p> After leaks have shown virtually everything the Pixel 4 has to offer, Netflix doesn't seem to care if someone spots the yet-to-be-unveiled phone on its website. The company has updated its lists of devices supporting HD and HDR10 playback to include a number of new flagships like the Samsung Galaxy Note10, Fold, and Tab S6, plus the Asus ROG Phone II – among them, you'll also find the unreleased Pixel 4 and 4 XL. </p>
<p> We've just covered Xiaomi catching up with Oppo by presenting its own under-display camera on Twitter right after the former showed off its prototype, but the internet is not the only place Xiaomi is attacking its rivals. First, the company started advertising its new Redmi K20 as the "Flagship Killer," the exact marketing term OnePlus aggressively used in its early years. Then, the firm put up billboards right next to OnePlus advertisements around India with a bold statement: "Starkly superior to the latest One." </p>

<p> xiaomi redmi note 4 </p>
<p> The most popular custom ROM available, LineageOS, keeps on getting better and better. Since we last covered the project, two more devices are now supported, and a number of great features have been added. The project recently posted a new changelog, highlighting recent improvements and device changes: </p>
<p> We already covered the TWRP 3.1.0 update, which brings several new features and bug fixes to the massively-popular custom recovery. TWRP is also expanding official support to several new devices, including the HTC U Ultra and Xiaomi Mi Max. </p>
<p> Straight after the global release of MIUI 8, Xiaomi is back with its newest device: the Redmi Note 4. Featuring a 5.5-inch 1080p display with 2.5D curved glass, a 4100mAh battery, and a full metal unibody design with chamfered edges, it's pretty clear the Chinese consumer electronics company is hoping that this one will be a big seller. </p>
<p> Other specifications include a 10-core MediaTek Helio X20 processor with clock speeds up to 2.1GHz, an 'ultra-fast' fingerprint scanner, and a 13MP f2.0 camera. 16GB will cost ￥899 ($135), while the 64GB model will cost a wallet-clenching ￥1199 ($180). It also has expandable storage through a hybrid SIM/storage tray, supporting up to 128GB microSD cards. </p>

<p> xkcd </p>
<p> Google has been using CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA for years now to crowdsource information from images it has found online. On the one side, you prove to Google you're a human, on the other, Google gets humans to see small images of text from a book, numbers on a house, or various objects and animals and provide OCR for the text and numbers plus logical grouping and categorization for the objects/animals. </p>
<p> That's the main dig that XKCD's comic today is based on. It's a CAPTCHA but it's asking the user to say if there's a stop sign, just so it can properly use that data to control its self-driving vehicle. </p>
<p> Many of you have probably seen yesterday's XKCD comic about the laughably terrible state of volume controls on mobile devices. The issue is particularly bad in Android apps, and developers really need to do something about it. Quite honestly, it's embarrassing that this is still a problem in 2017. </p>
<p> As I'm sure many of you know, Android has three distinct 'volumes' - one for media, one for the ringer, and one for alarms. Each has its own volume level, but unless you're playing media, adjusting the volume just changes the ringer - leading to the problem XKCD nailed in today's comic. </p>
<p> Every developer has gone through a long afternoon of making a bunch of tiny changes to their app, rebuilding and running it, then repeating the same steps just to get back to a point where they can test the changes they just made. Forget it, those days are done! Android Studio 2.0 just hit the Canary channel and its headlining feature allows you to push changes from your computer to an app while it's running and see results right away. Also joining the latest release is a brand new GPU Profiler tool that can make OpenGL ES development significantly easier. </p>

<p> In the grand scheme of the Internet, alt texts don't really matter. FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT, WHATCHA TALKIN' 'BOUT? I mean, they're only little blurbs of text that show up when you hover over an image on the web. YOUR MOM IS A BLURB. Usually, they're just the file name of the image or some insignificant gibberish tacked by WordPress or whatever online publishing tool the website you're visiting uses. THAT'S A BUNCH OF FJAFJKLDSKF7JKFDJ! I mean, in almost all cases, they don't add anything to what you're seeing. STOP USING APPROXIMATIONS. Ok, </p>
<p> Following on the success of the original xkcd Phone (which featured a blend of Android and iOS, a side-facing camera, and the ability to scream when falling), a successor has arrived that offers some of the best tech that 2014 has to offer. </p>
<p> The xkcd Phone 2 includes a revolutionary always-on front-facing speaker, which the phone will use to automatically cry when lost. With a built-in, ribbed, auto-rotating case made of 3D materials, the handset should feel comfortable in any hand size. And in a year where phones argued that HD wasn't HD enough, the xkcd Phone 2's MaxHD display competes by cramming over 350 pixels onto its screen (and doubling as a cheek toucher). </p>
<p> Too bad xkcd doesn't have a crappy app we could make fun of. That guy thought of everything! </p>

<p> Manufacturers, you're awful at naming things. Sorry. It's true. In many cases, you've either muddied the brand of your flagship devices, or made it incredibly difficult for customers to know what they should be asking for when they walk into a store. This is probably not a good thing since you want customers to buy your stuff. More than that, though, you want them to love your stuff, so they'll buy more of it. </p>
<p> Building on the hype surrounding HTC's new line of Android-powered smartphones, the Taiwanese manufacturer has released a series of promotional videos, showcasing the HTC One series and each device's individual strengths. </p>
<p> For those who may have somehow missed the buzz thus far, HTC's One series is packing some pretty impressive hardware, from the One X with a 1.5GHz quad-core processor, to the more budget-minded One V with its 1GHz processor and pocket-friendly 3.7" display. </p>
<p> HTC's UK Facebook page was updated last night with information regarding just which HTC handsets would be in the "first wave" of phones to receive an update to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich in early 2012. While the post was made on HTC's UK Facebook, the list contains a number of US-only devices. Those handsets are asterisked to indicate US-only availability (the Rezound, EVO Design, and Amaze). The others on the list include the Sensation (plus XL and XE versions), the Vivid, and the EVO 3D. </p>

<p> The creators of such marvels as My Beach and Celtic Garden, DualBoot Games, have outdone themselves this holiday season with Christmas HD - what I believe to be the most intricate live wallpaper I've seen on Android in a long time (ever?). </p>
<p> Customizable lights, gifts, tree topper, snowflakes, garlands, and a Christmas countdown are just the tip of the iceberg. Wait till you see your own photo above the fireplace, your family's names embroiled on the stockings, and a note to Santa signed by the same guy or gal who's looking back at you in the mirror every morning. </p>
<p> Just as promised, Rovio, the maker of the oh-so-popular Angry Birds, released a separate game called Angry Birds Seasons today, which contains 45 Halloween levels, previously only available on iOS, as well as 25 Christmas levels. </p>
<p> I haven't spotted any new birds yet, and I doubt they've added any, but I'm sure a few hours later, when you all finish every level, you will let us know. Oops, I take that back - the snow levels are available one per day, starting today, all the way through December 25th (see the last screenshot to see what happens if you try to click on day 2). </p>
<p> Rovio, the maker of Angry Birds, one of the most successful franchises to hit mobile gaming, is slowly starting to spread into our daily lives outside of our mobile devices. No, I'm not talking about all the Halloween awesomeness that we've been seeing today: </p>
<p> I am talking about the official Angry Birds plush toys that just dropped for pre-order. These furry little things are produced by Commonwealth Toys and come in 5 different versions. </p>

<p> x-men </p>
<p> You may remember an X-Men film from last year with the same name as this game, and they do tell the same basic story. The difference, however, is the game is true to the 1981 comic book story line and the movie is... well, not. X-Men: Days of Future Past is also a regular paid game with no in-app purchases. </p>
<p> X-Men: The Arcade Game is a throwback to the days before X-Men: The Animated Series. That show, known for it's amazing title track and some pretty laughable moments, gave us the "traditional" X-Men lineup most of us know today. However, before that aired, there was a one-off pilot called X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men. In it, Wolverine had an Australian accent. </p>
<p> It was pretty horrible. </p>
<p> Pryde of the X-Men served as X-Men: The Arcade Game's inspiration; inside, you play as the X-Men that were present in the cartoon, and face the villains they faced, as well. </p>

<p> Before there was Allo and Duo, before Hangouts was unveiled, there was Google Talk. In some ways, it was better than the Hangouts platform that replaced it. Talk had a real desktop app, and if you didn't like it, you could use any XMPP client to communicate. You could even send messages to users on other XMPP-powered services - a huge difference from today's proprietary messaging services. </p>
<p> Users of Google Voice have long called for the company to pay more attention to the seemingly forgotten service for quite some time. Unfortunately, they may be getting more than they were hoping for. While many people are thrilled to hear Voice will finally support MMS and become a part of Hangouts in early 2014, Google is also planning to close up shop for all 3rd-party apps that relied on the service for free texting and VoIP calling. Sadly, these apps will cease to function on May 15, 2014. </p>
<p> Google plans to shut down the XMPP interface currently used by alternative Voice apps. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2019/12/20 7:39am PSTon Dec 20, 2019 and last updated 2020/05/23 9:07am PDTon May 23, 2020. </p>
<p> Android's been around quite a while at this point (Google's Android turned 12 last year), and even Android phones have been around well over a decade now. And while obviously hardware like the HTC Hero matters in terms of where the platform got its start, and ones like the original Moto DROID mark its real entry into the marketplace in a big way, we think there are phones (and even A tablet) that are less remembered or less appreciated for their impact on the larger ecosystem. </p>
<p> After, when's the last time you thought of the Galaxy S2, or the HTC One M7? </p>
<p> It takes a lot of applications to build an ecosystem. Google has all the essentials down — email, calendar, contacts, productivity applications, and so on — but the company has always struggled with creative tools. Most notably, Google is still lacking a proper video editor for its own operating systems, which is becoming even more of an issue as high-end Chromebooks gain momentum. </p>
<p> Although development of Android for tablets has largely stagnated, mid-range media consumption tablets are still cheaply produced. The AT&T Moto Tab (stylized as 'moto tab') is technically Motorola's first tablet since the Xoom 2 (known as the Xyboard in the United States), though the design strongly resembles that of the Lenovo Tab 4 10. You can now buy the Moto Tab from AT&T for $299.99 upfront, or for $15/month for 20 months. This is $120 more than the Lenovo-branded tablet, though the two share more similarities in appearance than power. </p>
<p> Yesterday PayPal updated its Android app to take advantage of Xoom, a service that allows you to transfer money internationally. PayPal acquired Xoom back in 2015 and only began integrating Xoom's features into its own services late last year. With Xoom users can send money to people in over 62 countries via a few different means, including topping up prepaid phones. Anyone who may be regularly sending cash to friends or family abroad will likely welcome the new Xoom integration. </p>
<p> Of all the Android ROMs out there, few receive even a fraction of the love that CyanogenMod does. For users that like to flash ROMs and experiment with all Android has to offer, getting official Cyanogen support can be like Christmas morning. Today users of the HTC One XL and the old Verizon Motorola XOOM get to do a little happy dance as CyanogenMod 10.1 nightlies have become available for the XOOM, while an experimental build is up for the One XL. </p>
<p> Definition: A "nightly" is a bleeding edge release that is built on a daily basis, usually at night after a full day's worth of new code has been committed. </p>
<p> Don't you just love when your device gets a new version of CM? It's like getting an update from the Android gods, because who knows when the manufacturer/carrier is going to send one out. </p>
<p> Today, four new devices are added to the CM10.1 list: </p>
<p> XOOM Wi-Fi (wingray) </p>
<p> XOOM 3G (everest) Note: Not compatible with the Verizon variant! </p>
<p> Samsung Fascinate (fascinatemtd) </p>
<p> ...and a newcomer to the scene, the ODROID-U2 (odroidu2) </p>
<p> That's excellent news for the owners of those devices, but we're sure there's one question on everyone's mind here: what the hell is an ODROID-U2? We wondered the same, but a little digging turned up the answer: it's an Exynos4412 dev platform with a couple gigs of RAM and a Mali-400 GPU. </p>
<p> Earlier this evening, CyanogenMod's Google+ page published an announcement that read "Who says Everest is in Nepal?". That's right – the Motorola Xoom 3G (GSM) variant has joined the list of CM-supported devices, getting its first experimental build dated 10-17. </p>
<p> Steady Hawkin, in a comment to the announcement, notes that the experimental build is "still a WIP," and encourages users to report any issues they may encounter. </p>
<p> If you're a Xoom GSM owner looking for some CM10 action, just keep an eye on the CyanogenMod download center's Everest page (linked below) for the latest builds. As CM's announcement notes, mountaineers need not apply. </p>
<p> Well, that was fast. Android 4.1.2 was just released to AOSP last week, and Motorola has already started pushing the Wi-Fi XOOM's update out to soak testers. This isn't a huge jump in terms of functionality, and the incremental update will bump the XOOM from build JRO03H (4.1.1) to JZO54K (4.1.2). </p>
<p> Of course, those who aren't soak testers are probably wondering how they can get this update now. The beauty of Google-supported hardware like the Wi-FI XOOM (which is, for all intents and purposes a Nexus device), is that Big G makes updates likes this one available almost immediately. Therefore, it can be downloaded and manually applied right now. </p>
<p> In a post to Google's Android Building group today, Jean-Baptiste Queru once again acted as the bearer of good tidings for developers and tweakers everywhere, announcing that "a new set of proprietary binaries for Jelly Bean are available." </p>
<p> The new batch of binaries includes those of the Nexus S and Nexus S 4G (Crespo and Crespo4G respectively), the latter of which we just recently saw added into the AOSP fold. </p>
<p> The set also includes updates to the both the GSM Galaxy Nexus (maguro), and Verizon's Galaxy Nexus (toro, which itself is ever so close to full AOSP support). </p>
<p> Conspicuously absent from the party is Sprint's variant of the Galaxy Nexus, but there's no surprise there. </p>
<p> Update 7/26/12: It looks like the JRO03H update was final after all and has now started rolling out to everyone. Grab your XOOM and taste some Jelly Bean (thanks, @Fdiazreal and @iphilluv). </p>
<p> The Wi-Fi XOOM Jelly Bean update is almost here - after a brief delay it's finally rolling out to a limited group of soak testers who volunteer to provide feedback and test release candidates early. If all goes well, we should expect a wide release probably in the next few days, although if you're feeling brave, you can attempt to flash the update zip over your stock IMM76 build using a USB-OTG cable and these instructions. </p>

<p> xoom 2 </p>
<p> While the US variants of the XOOM 2 (known as the Xyboard/Droid Xyboard in the States) have been sitting on ICS for a while now, the lonely European versions have been idly waiting for their update to roll in. Good news: today's the day! </p>
<p> Motorola announced via its Facebook page that not only are the XOOM 2 variants getting the bump to ICS, but the XOOM Family Edition is receiving the update, as well. </p>
<p> Over the past 2 days, I've been watching a thread over at MDW that showcased a rooted Motorola XYBOARD tablet but instructed us to wait a few days for the root method to be released. Root was achieved by none other than Dan Rosenberg, the ninja from vulnfactory.org, who has been serving multiple root methods for previously unrootable devices left and right. </p>
<p> Good news, everyone [of you five fine gentlemen in the corner who own a XYBOARD] - as of this morning, we have the root files. </p>
<p> Earlier today, Verizon officially announced the upcoming Droid XYBOARD's / XOOM 2's December 12th release date, but who really wants to wait this long just to grab all of its delicious wallpapers? Nobody, that's who, which is why all 11 of them are now looking for a new home, thanks to Droid Life. </p>
<p> Download them one by one (right click, then Save Link As) or grab the whole collection if you want - the choice is yours. </p>
<p> We've heard the rumors and seen the pictures, but Motorola just made the XOOM 2 official. Just like suspected, there are two different versions: a 10.1-inch model, geared towards enterprise and corporate users; and an 8.2-inch Media Edition, designed for movies and music playback. In terms of hardware spec, both tablets are little more than an incremental upgrade from the original XOOM: </p>
<p> A page from a catalog of the popular UK mobile retailer Carphone Warehouse was recently leaked, and it clearly states the Motorola XOOM 2 will be available in the UK in time for Christmas. </p>
<p> The catalog was intended for the Irish market, and thus the price has been listed in Euros as €399. Generally, prices in Euros and GBP for consumer electronics aren't reflective of exchange rates when attempting to determine a comparable price in the US - we're fairly certain the XOOM 2 will retail for $400 here in the US of A. </p>
<p> When we first reported on Motorola's alleged Xoom 2, very few - if any - details were certain. An anonymous tipster has been piling on the information since then, however, providing photos, (some) specs, and perhaps the most interesting detail of all - a second, smaller version of the Xoom 2, expected to be billed as an "e-reader replacement." </p>
<p> The Xoom 2's smaller relative appears to have the same rear buttons (power and volume rocker) as its larger counterpart, and a generally similar form factor, if not yet completely polished. </p>
<p> The Motorola XOOM was a truly unique device: it marked the beginning of the Android tablet era, stole a portion (admittedly a very small one) of the iPad 2's pre-announcement hype, and... weighed about as much as a tank driven by Chris Christie. </p>
<p> Well now its successor, the XOOM 2, has begun to hit the rumor mill - just a few minutes ago, Droid Life leaked two pictures of the slate: </p>
<p> We don't have a ton of information on the device as of yet, but DL's "sources" say that its weight is similar to that of the XOOM (!), </p>
<p> Apparently Motorola is in the middle of a site redesign. Exciting, right? Pff... no. But the contents that were discovered because of said site redesign... now that's pretty exciting. PocketNow has acquired some images of the new site that display some upcoming Moto devices, including the XOOM 2, a couple of new handsets, and, curiously enough, a watch. </p>
<p> Let's start off with the new phones: the Slimline and the Zaha (shown above, respectively). </p>

<p> It's April now, a solid five months or so after the Ice Cream Sandwich source code dropped. We've all been waiting eagerly for our old devices to see Google's latest and greatest. Today, on Reddit, a Verizon employee dropped some slides that detail Verizon's plans for ICS launches. Notable devices include the HTC Rezound, the Motorola Droid RAZR and Droid RAZR MAXX, as well as the premiere Google tablet, the Xoom 3G/4G. </p>
<p> Motorola XOOM 3G owners, today is your lucky day. Okay, well, maybe not lucky, but still good - the OTA update to Android 3.2 has officially started rolling out. This update brings some subtle, yet nice new features to the Motorola tablet: </p>
<p> + Screen Scaling Compatibility Mode: Ability to switch to double pixel mode for selected applications. When selected, application sub-windows and drop down menus are also doubled. In addition, pixel doubling settings are saved for each application. </p>

<p> While the US variants of the XOOM 2 (known as the Xyboard/Droid Xyboard in the States) have been sitting on ICS for a while now, the lonely European versions have been idly waiting for their update to roll in. Good news: today's the day! </p>
<p> Motorola announced via its Facebook page that not only are the XOOM 2 variants getting the bump to ICS, but the XOOM Family Edition is receiving the update, as well. </p>
<p> After learning that yesterday's XYBoard root (which was thought to work on all Gingerbread/Honeycomb Moto devices) didn't play nice with Motorola's Xoom Family Edition, highly respected security researcher Dan Rosenberg decided to have a look, hoping to bring root back to the FE. </p>
<p> In a post to his blog earlier today, Rosenberg announced that he has found a working exploit for rooting the Xoom Family Edition. Rosenberg has again beaten others to the punch, namely a developer called Evil_DevNull, who Rosenberg calls out in the post for the alleged plagiarism of a previous FE exploit. </p>
<p> Motorola is resurrecting the world's first Honeycomb tablet one last time before the next generation of XOOM becomes available, but this time it has a family-friendly twist. It's called the XOOM Family Edition, and it's basically the same Wi-Fi XOOM that has been out for months now, but it's packing around $40 of additional games and other software specifically targeted at kids. Among the bundled software is Zoodles, an app that locks the home button and only grants access to user-defined apps, so you can keep those kiddos away from apps that you deem unfit. </p>

<p> xperia </p>
<p> Sony has just announced an event for a new Xperia device launch. The company is being coy on what exactly is being announced here, but our guess is the Xperia 5 II that we saw leaked last month. The event is set for September 17th, a week from today. </p>
<p> There are a few unusual things about the Xperia 1 II, including the super-tall display and the stupid name, but arguably the most unusual thing is the price. Back when B&H first put the One-Two up for pre-order, we were amazed at that $1,198 price, and thought that Sony might be reconsidering the price when the number was taken down. However, Sony confirmed that price a few days later, though it did mention it'd be throwing in a free pair of WF-1000XM3s for pre-orders. </p>
<p> Sony is having a hard time in the smartphone business amidst declining sales and shrinking market share, but its users are likely more distressed right now. Many existing Sony users found that the recent Android 10 update broke their 2018 flagships almost universally, with no official communication from the company. In what appears to be a widespread issue, the affected Xperia XZ3 and XZ2 owners rallied on community platforms like Reddit complaining about a long list of bugs, including terrible RAM management, high battery consumption, app fails, and a generally sluggish UI. </p>
<p> Sony officially introduced the compact 6.1-inch Xperia 5 at IFA in September last year, so it's no surprise that the first leaks of a possible successor or sister model start showing up now. CAD renders of some Xperia 5 Plus have been published on Slashleaks. The device looks almost identical to its smaller sibling but comes with a bigger screen and a headphone jack. </p>
<p> Devoted PlayStation users have for years called on Sony to bring official support for Remote Play game streaming app to non-Sony handsets, and it seems their demands will finally be met. Sony has announced to release the v7.00 update for the PlayStation 4 within this week, bringing the feature to a wider range of Android devices. </p>
<p> The Xperia 1 is Sony's new flagship smartphone. It was first shown off at Mobile World Congress earlier this year, and comes equipped with everything you'd expect from a high-end smartphone in 2019, all in an extremely-tall 2:1 design. Pre-orders already begun in the United States, and now it has a shipping date, and people in Europe can buy the phone too. </p>
<p> It's no secret that Sony's mobile division has been struggling for years. Every quarter, the financials consistently show losses under the Mobile Communications section, and the Q4 2018 and FY2018 results are no different. That said, the mobile division is an outlier, as Sony as a whole is still profitable. </p>
<p> Today is another day for phone deals. Right now, you can pick up a Sony Xperia XZ2 from either Amazon or Best for $449.99, a savings of $50. That's a really decent price for a Snapdragon 845 device. </p>
<p> Two days ago, Sony revealed a drastic change in its business organization going forward. Sony's Mobile Communications division — responsible for the Xperia line of phones — will be merged with the Imaging Products & Solutions and Home Entertainment & Sound divisions. This "realignment" unifies all of Sony's consumer electronics branches under a single internal division, while conveniently hiding the mobile division's future losses behind a merged balance sheet. That's good for Sony, because according to today's exchange rate, the company has lost over $910 million in the last year making phones. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ2 Premium debuted with an MSRP of $1,000. Predictably, that hasn't worked out well for Sony. Luckily, as any phone tends to do after some time, the price has dropped to a much more palatable $649.99, which is $350 less than the launch price and $250 under current MSRP, from Amazon, B&H, and Focus Camera. </p>

<p> xperia 10 </p>
<p> Sony released the mid-range Xperia 10 and 10 Plus phones slightly over a year ago, and the devices were set to receive Android 10 sometime in "early 2020." I'm not sure if May counts as early in the year, but regardless, Sony is finally rolling out the OS update to the Xperia 10 series. </p>
<p> The Sony Xperia 10 Plus maybe a jack of all trades, but it’s tough to justify its original price of $430. However, its all-time low price for Cyber Monday is enticing enough to give the mid-ranger a second look. Amazon and B&H are both pulling its price down to $300, saving you a handsome $130 only for today. </p>
<p> The Sony Xperia 10 isn't a bad phone, but it was certainly difficult to recommend at its $349.99 MSRP. For Black Friday, however, Amazon and B&H have slashed the price by more than half to just $169.99, making this a pretty enticing phone for the money. </p>
<p> Despite continuing losses in its mobile business sector, Sony still churns out phone after phone, much to the delight of its ardent fan base. It also maintains its existing lineup with new software updates and, just like many other manufacturers before it, the company has just shared when which of its devices will receive Android 10. </p>
<p> Just last week, two of Sony's super-tall mid-range phones — the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus — dropped to $50 below their usual prices. If you missed out on that, Sony has reduced the price of the regular Xperia 10 by another $50, bringing it down to just $250. </p>
<p> If you've been waiting to snag Sony's ultra-tall mid-range phone, now's your chance. The Xperia 10 and 10 Plus are both $50 off the usual prices, bringing the regular 10 down to $300 and the 10 Plus to $375. </p>
<p> The new Xperia 10 and 10 Plus might not be the most interesting phones out there, but Sony has made them a bit more appealing for certain buyers today. These phones are the latest additions to Sony's Open Devices program. So, you can unlock and flash software on your Xperia 10 and 10 Plus without any arduous workarounds. </p>
<p> After a period of what seemed like smartphone stagnation, we're finally seeing some weird devices again. With edge-to-edge screens, hole-punch cameras, and displays that fold in half being high-end oddities, Sony saw fit to shake up the budget formula, too, and plopped ultra-tall 21:9 displays in its Xperia 10 and 10 Plus. And while I applaud its efforts, being long doesn't save the Xperia 10 line from being terminally boring. </p>
<p> Sony's recently-announced Xperia 10 and 10 Plus, best known as those new mid-rangers with ridiculously tall screens, have gone up for pre-order in the United States at Amazon, B&H, and Best Buy. The Xperia 10 comes in at $349.99, and the larger Xperia 10 Plus will retail for $429.99. Both will be released on March 18th. </p>
<p> So much of the new stuff we're seeing in smartphones is focused on screens right now: new notch styles, embedded fingerprint scanners, and even screens that fold. Two years ago, one of the furthest-reaching changes in screen design got off the ground at MWC with the introduction of the LG G6 and its 18:9 aspect ratio panel, noticeable taller (or wider, depending on how you're holding it) than the 16:9 displays that had dominated phones to date. Now Sony's ready to introduce the next chapter in this saga, with the launch of three Xperia phones featuring 21:9 screens. </p>

<p> When pricing for the Xperia 1 II was announced last month, a lot was made of its high $1,200 price tag in the US, with some hoping it was a mistake. Sony confirmed that this was no error, but in line with Sony's pricing in recent years, its latest flagship makes more sense as a purchase in other regions. In Europe, where it retails for €1,200/£1,100, pre-order offers have included a free pair of the excellent WH-1000XM3 ANC over-ear headphones, but they've all run out now so the deal has been downgraded to include a cheaper set. </p>
<p> Sony's smartphone design language has long stagnated, but last year, the company stepped up its game with the Xperia 1 and 10, coming with 21:9 displays and slightly more rounded corners than Xperia devices of old. Today, the company has released the follow-ups for these two phones, the Xperia 1 II and 10 II (speak: Xperia 1 mark 2), stepping up both handsets' cameras and resurrecting the headphone jack on the high-end device. It's also Sony's first to come with 5G. </p>

<p> xperia 10 plus </p>
<p> 16:9 aspect ratios were the norm for years, but that's not the case anymore. These days, we don't even bat an eye at 18:9, 18.5:9, and 19:9 ratios. In a curious attempt to stand out from the crowd, Sony slapped some ridiculously tall 21:9 displays on their latest phones, including the Xperia 10 Plus that is being discounted to ~$330 right now. </p>
<p> In this crazy world we live in, it helps to remember that somethings never change: the sun rises in the east, the sky is blue, and Sony phones get their prices slashed a few months after release. Now you can grab the mid-range Xperia 10 Plus for just $349.99, a $80 discount from the original MSRP, and a $50 drop from the usual price. </p>
<p> If you've been waiting to snag Sony's ultra-tall mid-range phone, now's your chance. The Xperia 10 and 10 Plus are both $50 off the usual prices, bringing the regular 10 down to $300 and the 10 Plus to $375. </p>
<p> If you're curious about getting an Android phone that's arguably more screen than anything else, Sony's latest Xperia devices might have something to offer you with its 21:9 CinemaWide displays. And if you've been waiting for a reason to make the jump, you now have a little monetary incentive: the Xperia 10 Plus is $50 off at participating retailers right now. </p>

<p> xperia 1 II </p>
<p> As smartphones have converged on the "flat glass slab" form factor, companies like Samsung and OnePlus have risen to the top. Sony, on the other hand, has not. The $1,200 Sony Xperia 1 II is the company's latest attempt to sell you a phone, but it feels more like a vanity project for Sony than a viable product. It's got dazzling specifications, but that's not enough to make a phone competitive these days. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/03/06 11:32am PSTon Mar 6, 2020 and last updated 2020/08/05 4:10pm PDTon Aug 5, 2020. </p>
<p> We live in the year 2020 and Netflix still feels the need to list which Android phones, tablets, and associated silicon can support streaming shows in HD and in HDR10. The company is usually slow to update that list, but even so, if you're wondering if your newly-purchased slab can take on all the resolution you need to watch "Stranger Things" again, we've got the list for you. The latest (predictable) addition on it is the new Pixel 4a. </p>
<p> There are a few unusual things about the Xperia 1 II, including the super-tall display and the stupid name, but arguably the most unusual thing is the price. Back when B&H first put the One-Two up for pre-order, we were amazed at that $1,198 price, and thought that Sony might be reconsidering the price when the number was taken down. However, Sony confirmed that price a few days later, though it did mention it'd be throwing in a free pair of WF-1000XM3s for pre-orders. </p>

<p> The Xperia 1 II, with its 4K HDR OLED display and 5G-capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 865, is going to cost every penny we thought we would and a couple dollars more. Customers who intend on reserving a device in the month of June will find themselves handsomely rewarded when the phone finally ships on July 24 — yep, that's going to be a while from now. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/20 8:38am PDTon May 20, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/21 9:20am PDTon May 21, 2020. </p>
<p> It's been a while since Sony introduced us to its 5G-capable Xperia 1 II — maybe the past 3 months have just been a huge mic check one, two for the company. However, that phone has come back into the spotlight at B&H Photo where the retailer is accepting pre-orders and displaying quite the dear price for it. </p>

<p> xperia 2 </p>
<p> We've come to high season for high-pressure presentations in cavernous venues for little pieces of circuitry encased in glass, metal, and plastic again. IFA 2019 is just about underway in Berlin and tech companies are on rehearsals looking for the right words, notes, camera shots, and switches to hit. Unfortunately for Sony, someone in the control room flipped the wrong switch and briefly revealed the existence of the company's next big smartphone, the Xperia 5. </p>
<p> Sony is one of the few Android OEMs that still updates its flagship phone twice a year. Before prices can even come down on one Sony phone, there's a newer model. We expect Sony to replace the still very new Xperia 1 at IFA with the Xperia 2, and a handful of leaked images provide a sneak peek at that device. Spoiler: it looks like the Xperia 1. </p>

<p> Sony just took the wraps off the Xperia 5 at IFA, and it's pretty much what we expected based on the earlier leaks. The company has decided to skip digits 2-4 with the new phone, and while that might imply big changes, many of the specs are substantially unchanged from the Xperia 1 launched earlier this year. This is basically the same phone, but smaller and with a lower-resolution screen. </p>

<p> Good news, Xperia Play, neo, and arc owners: the worlds greatest custom ROM, CyanogenMod, is coming soon to a device near you! Thanks to some newly submitted code, support for these devices can be expected to hit the CyanogenMod repositories soon, and nightlies will be available shortly after that. </p>
<p> Just a few days ago Sony Ericsson confirmed an early off-contract August launch for the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc. And now, on the eve of August, the official Sony Ericsson Online store launched a page allowing customers to pre-order the Android 2.3 device for $599.99 with an expected shipping date of 2 August. It is also possible to obtain an 18-month extended warranty for an additional $99.99. </p>

<p> Once again, we find that the selection of Android phones available to those in Canada is increasing both in size and quality. The next two additions to that ever-growing range of devices available in the Great White North are to be the Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY and arc. According to a press release from Best Buy Canada, as of April 28th, these two great new handsets will be available on Rogers. </p>
<p> Thanks to the hardworking devs over at the XDA-Developers forum, the Xperia arc(sic) has been rooted. The pair responsible for the breakthrough, Bin4ry and zdzihu, released the how-to info early this morning (or late last night for you insomniacs). It seems like a pretty simple process: Unlock the bootloader, download Bin4ry's file, and flash it with fastboot. </p>
<p> This currently only applies to the UK version of the device, but it is expected to be ready for phones running the global firmware sometime tonight. </p>
<p> What better way for Sony to promote its newest line of Xperia Arc smartphones than by hiring the little (big) green robot to dance? This Android has some pretty slick dance moves, giving a whole new meaning to the phrase "doing the robot". </p>
<p> Sit back, turn up the volume, and check out this awesome video: </p>
<p> If rumors are to be believed, NEC's newest Android phone - the MEDIAS E-04C - will be the world's thinnest smartphone at 7.7mm when it launches this Thursday. It has only been a short time since Sony Ericsson launched the razor-thin Xperia arc and Samsung crowned its Galaxy S II phone as the "world's thinnest smartphone," but at 8.7mm and 8.49mm at their thinnest points, respectively, these phones look positively obese in comparison. </p>
<p> A couple of weeks ago at CES 2011, Sony Ericsson announced its latest Android handset - the sleek and sexy Gingerbread-running Xperia Arc. They've also invited the press, Android Police included, to attend a media breakfast where we ended up spending over an hour of quality time with the new device, documented in great detail here. If you have questions about the Arc, I highly recommend you dive into the above post, as it contains a plethora of useful bits and pieces, all wrapped in a convenient package. </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson posted profits of 35 million euros ($47.14 million) in Q4 of 2010, due largely to major downsizing combined with a shift towards Android-based smartphones. Although Sony Ericsson sold fewer phones overall, Android enthusiasts will be happy to hear that they managed to sell over 9 million Android-based Xperia phones, including the X10, X10 Mini, X10 Pro, and X8, since their launch. </p>
<p> In the last year, Sony has made significant changes after reporting losses of 836 million euros in 2009 ($1.13 billion). </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson has announced its first of a "new generation" of Xperia smartphones, christened the Xperia arc. The super-slim device measures 8.7 mm at its thinnest point and weighs just 117 grams. It packs: </p>
<p> 1GHz Qualcomm processor </p>
<p> 4.2" 854 x 480 display </p>
<p> 8.1 MP camera (with HD video recording and LED flash) </p>
<p> 8GB microSD (upgradeable to 32GB) </p>
<p> FM radio, Bluetooth, and GPS </p>
<p> Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) </p>
<p> Engadget managed to spend some time with the Xperia arc, and they highlighted the fact that it's "really thin." </p>

<p> xperia arc s </p>
<p> There must be something weird going on with manufacturers lately - first Huawei released an alpha build of ICS for the Honor, and now Sony Ericsson (soon to be just Sony) has released an ICS ROM for certain unlocked Xperia devices, including the Arc S, Neo V, and Ray. </p>
<p> Since it's an alpha ROM, it's not made for day-to-day use, as it is limited to just a few functions at the moment. </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson's original Xperia arc was a great phone, winning Best European Camera Phone from EISA, and another award for its sleek design. The arc's next iteration- the Xperia arc S was announced by Sony today in Berlin, and ups the ante over its predecessor by packing in a 1.4 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and a sweep panorama camera function that has the capability of creating 3D panoramas. The phone also comes with access to Sony's Music and Video unlimited services, bringing a lot more entertainment to your device. </p>

<p> Xperia owners, watch out. Lollipops are raining from the sky and smashing straight into your screens. If you welcome this phenomenon, don't do anything. These lollipops have heat-seeking sensors and will find your devices wherever they lay. If you prefer KitKat, you can swat the intruders away, but you'll never get to experience the future changes in store for your Android device. </p>
<p> Sony has confirmed that it is launching lollipops at Xperia Z3, Z3 Compact, and Z3 Tablet Compact devices all over the world (some of these updates were previously pushed out to smaller, test markets). </p>
<p> Sony is boasting its new Xperia C3 as the best smartphone for taking selfies thanks to its wide-angle 5MP front-facing "PROselfie" camera, soft LED flash, and a set of quirky apps. Hey, scoff all you want, but this is a big deal. Selfie is a real word now, and if I have to write about the subject seriously, the least you can do is read this with a straight face. </p>

<p> Xperia C4 </p>
<p> Sony isn't known for getting Android updates out especially quickly, and the fact that Android 6.0 Marshmallow is only arriving now (a month after Nougat's official release) for the Xperia C4 and Xperia C4 Dual is proof of that. Then again, this is a last-generation, mid-range phone with an unconventional MediaTek chipset, so we'll cut Sony some slack for this one. </p>
<p> We're well past the point where any Android enthusiast would be expecting (or perhaps more accurately hoping) that his or her phone will be getting an update full of Marshmallowy goodness, perhaps delivered by some confectionary fairy. Alas, for owners of the Xperia C4 and Xperia C5 Ultra, it's a bag full of Lollipops instead. Both phones are now being updated by Sony to Android 5.1, a version of the OS which we'll remind you is now almost a year old. </p>
<p> Both phones began receiving their respective software late last night, at least according to the updated pages on Sony's support site. </p>
<p> When I was in Istanbul last week, I saw street vendors waving selfie sticks (aka the wand of Narcissus) and offering for a few liras to hold your phone so you can take a selfie from a better angle. If something hits the hawker market, it's safe to say that it's pervasive and in-demand. That's the angle that the newly announced Sony Xperia C4 is coming from. Sony even has a name for all the cool selfles that this smartphone can take — PROselfies. Because regular selfies aren't enough. </p>
<p> The recipe for cooking up a PROselfie involves a 5MP 25mm wide-angle lens with Sony's Exmor R sensor, a soft LED flash, and HDR for balancing the exposure as much as possible and capturing both you and your background clearly. </p>

<p> xperia e1 </p>
<p> Sony has shared in a blog post the beginning of its KitKat rollout for the Xperia E1 and E1 Dual. The update will include the usual goodies that come with Android 4.4 along with some changes to Sony's exclusive software. The company has provided a changelog of what to expect, and it's identical to the one it posted for the Xperia T2 Ultra. </p>
<p> To briefly recap what may soon hit an Xperia device near you, this update contains a tweaked status bar, revisions to quick settings, a theme that matches that of the PlayStation 4, and an improved ability to move files from internal memory to a micro SD card. </p>
<p> Two new devices are being added to the Xperia family today in the form of the Xperia E1 and Xperia T2 Ultra. These phones sit below flagship devices like the Z1 and Z1 Ultra, but they still have that slick Sony design and the OEM's custom build of Android 4.3. </p>

<p> xperia e3 </p>
<p> Sony hasn't always been the best at updating its phones, but the company does have a commitment to AOSP unlike most others. It contributes a lot of code to Android, and developers are encouraged to tinker with unlocked devices. In fact, Sony has just announced support for AOSP on the Xperia E3 and Xperia T3, meaning all Qualcomm-based phones from 2014 can run pure Android with very little hassle. </p>
<p> Here at IFA 2014 in Berlin, Sony is announcing new entries to its Xperia smartphone line at all levels. The flagship Z series, last updated only six months ago at Mobile World Congress, has been bolstered with the Xperia Z3. This device is the tip top of Sony's line, though in terms of sheer hardware it's an evolution rather than a revolution. The 5.2-inch 1080p screen, Snapdragon 801 processor (bumped up to 2.5Ghz), and 20.7MP rear camera are similar to the last iteration, but the body is much thinner at 7.3mm. </p>

<p> xperia ear </p>
<p> We've known about the Sony Xperia Ear since February when it was announced at MWC along with 3 other prototype projects. At the time, Sony said it was coming late in the summer, but the date was later postponed to November, and here we are. The Xperia Ear is now available for pre-order exclusively on the Xperia Store online in Europe. It'll cost GBP 179 in the UK and EUR 199 in France, Spain, Germany, and other European countries. </p>
<p> So what's the Xperia Ear? It's a Bluetooth headset, but it's not made for music as much as it's a personal assistant living inside your ear. </p>
<p> An ongoing issue with smartphones is that they pull people out of the world around them. Instead of interacting with others face-to-face or being aware of our surroundings, we increasingly spend our time tapping out tiny screens. </p>
<p> During Mobile World Congress, Sony announced a series of concept devices aimed at alleviating this issue. The idea is to keep us connected in a way that doesn't require staring down at a screen. Products include an earpierce, a clip-on camera, a projector, and a tiny robot. Only the first, the Xperia Ear, is coming out this year. </p>
<p> Today at MWC, Sony announced four new connected gadgets which it hopes will let people look up from their phone screens more and engage the world around them. The products include a bluetooth earpiece, a wearable camera, a vertical projector, and a friendly robot, which are respectively called the Xperia Ear, Xperia Eye, Xperia Projector, and Xperia Agent. </p>
<p> Three of those products are actually just concepts: only the Xperia Ear has an expected launch date, and it won't come out until later this summer. The remaining products — the Eye, Projector, and Agent — are nowhere to be seen here at MWC and it will likely take some time for them to get to market, if they do at all. </p>

<p> We reviewed the Sony Xperia XZ3 last month and we were pleasantly surprised by how good it is. Now, the Japanese company's latest flagship phone has hit Amazon, and those who pre-order can get a pair of Xperia Ear Duo wireless earphones thrown in free of charge. </p>
<p> Sony's follow-up to 2016's Xperia Ear, the Xperia Ear Duo, is available to pre-order right now on Amazon, and will be on sale there and at b8ta on May 25. Introduced in February, Xperia Ear Duo is a fully wireless headset with a unique under-ear design. </p>
<p> When Sony's Xperia Ear was first announced as a concept project in February of 2016, we were all a little wary of the utility of an assistant living inside our ears. But with Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant spreading their wings everywhere from our speakers to our appliances and even our headphones, the idea isn't as alien anymore. So Sony is following up now on its original Xperia Ear, which eventually launched in October of 2016, with an upgraded model dubbed the Xperia Ear Duo. </p>

<p> It's been a long time coming, guys – we've definitely seen our fair share of upset Xperia P owners who've been waiting for this update. But, the good news is that it's finally here, and the P is joined by the go and E Dual. </p>
<p> According to the Sony blog, the 4.1 update not only brings Jelly Bean, but also a slew of new enhancements that Sony has been working to "blend" with the OS. </p>
<p> Sometimes, it can be a bit arguable what counts as a "low end" phone these days. Even cheap phones are so powerful that calling them anything lower than mid-range can seem insulting. This one, however, makes us pretty comfortable with the moniker. With a 1GHz Snapdragon S1 processor, a 320x480 TFT display, and a 3.2MP rear camera, the Xperia E fills out Sony's budget line just fine. </p>
<p> Optionally, the Xperia E Dual has the option for dual SIM card slots, which is great for business users, and those who need to work with multiple networks. </p>

<p> xperia ion </p>
<p> Sony has handed out Jelly Bean to a number of devices in the past month, but it has taken a while for the update to reach the Xperia Ion. That's now changing. Build number 6.2.B.0.211 has started to roll out to the device that, until now, was missing out on all the fun that its Xperia siblings were having. </p>
<p> Despite the wait, this is not an over-the-air update. Owners need access to a computer and the Sony PC Companion to update their device. </p>
<p> Good news for Sony fans: the company is finally starting to roll out Jelly Bean updates to some of its more notable 2012 smartphones. The former headliner Xperia S, its brother the SL, and the camera-focused SL all have Android 4.1 waiting for them. Users will need the a Windows PC and the Sony PC Companion to download and install the updated software, which includes a refreshed kernel as well. </p>
<p> I suppose you have to give Sony credit for at least keeping its customers informed. Today, the manufacturer announced an update to its plans for bringing its phones up to Jelly Bean. If you're rocking the Xperia T, Xperia TX, or Xperia V, you should see Android 4.1 "during February and March." Of course, this will depend on what market you're in or which variant you own. </p>
<p> Following those flagships, the Xperia P, Xperia J and Xperia go will start to receive their upgrades starting around the end of March. </p>
<p> Getting tired of running the stock OS on your Xperia Ion? If so, official CyanogenMod nightlies are now available for the device (codenamed aoba). The first CM9 build hit get.cm just a bit ago, so you're only a download away from having one of the smoothest, best supported AOSP ROMs on the planet. </p>
<p> Definition: A "nightly" is a bleeding edge release that is built on a daily basis, usually at night after a full day's worth of new code has been committed. </p>
<p> Back at CES in January we got a first glance at Sony's latest flagship phone, the Xperia Ion. In our time with it, the device made an impression with its 720P display and 12 megapixel camera. As expected, this device is finally showing up on AT&T with an announcement today of the device's availability later this month. </p>
<p> Sony, you really confuse me sometimes. The US is just about to get the Xperia Ion on AT&T, supposedly the Sony-branded flagship smartphone. The problem is that the Xperia GX just took that crown from the Ion - before it even came out. I'm not sure what Sony's grand master plan here is, but looking from the outside in, it seems like the company (that lost $5.7 billion last year - most of it in the fourth quarter alone) is flying completely and utterly blind. </p>
<p> An eager, eagle-eyed XDA member spotted a Google ad while searching for "xperia ion" that may be showing AT&T's hand concerning the release date of said device. One of a few ads that appear when searching for the device states that the Xperia Ion is "Coming Exclusively to AT&T in June." Well, that narrows it down a bit! </p>
<p> The ad doesn't give a specific date, but it does narrow down the date range significantly. </p>
<p> We stopped by the Sony booth earlier this morning at CES, and got some hands-on time with the very first Sony smartphones (Sony-Ericsson is no more, subject to regulatory approval) - the Xperia Ion and the Xperia S. While these devices were designed before the Sony Ericsson breakup, they'll be marketed as Sony devices when they hit retail channels. </p>
<p> AT&T embraced the go big or go home motto like a boss today at CES -- it announced six new Android devices. Three premium phones, two budget phones, and a budget tablet. Not only that, but every single one of these new devices will run on its 4G LTE network. Let's take a look at what we know so far, and we'll update as more info shows up. </p>
<p> Update: I would like to note that just because all of the phones are shown running Gingerbread, that doesn't mean they won't ship with ICS. </p>

<p> Sony's just dropped a batch of bombshells on us today during an IFA press conference. Among the headlining new devices, the Xperia J which is being billed as an affordable smartphone with a "standout screen size." That "standout" size is 4", by the way. We're not entirely sure who Sony thinks they're going to impress with four inches, but the rest of the specs actually seem like a pretty good deal if the price is right. </p>

<p> Sony has announced the Xperia M2 Aqua, a variant of the M2 that it's marketing as "the waterproof smartphone for everyone." It's Sony's first water-resistant phone with mid-range specs, and it's apparently ready to swim with the best of them. </p>
<p> In the small print, we see that the Xperia M2 Aqua is IP65 and IP68 compliant, meaning that it can withstand dust and survive being kept under 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. </p>
<p> We've been seeing quite a lot of Sony's "Xperia Sirius," and it looks like Sony is ready to take the wraps off of it here at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. As expected, it's the flagship successor to the Z1, somewhat disappointingly named the Xperia Z2. Sony is also announcing the Xperia M2 today, a more midrange phone with Sony's standard industrial design and dual SIM card slots. </p>
<p> The Z2 improves on the Z1 with a 5.2-inch 1080p LCD display, matching LG's G2. </p>

<p> xperia m5 </p>
<p> The Xperia Z series has marked the high-end of Sony's smartphone line for years. The M5 sits somewhere lower on the food chain, but not much lower. You're looking at a 5-inch 1080p display, 3GB of RAM, a 21.5MP camera, plus both water and dust resistance. </p>
<p> Now you also get Android 6.0. Sony has begun pushing out an over-the-air update to this device. </p>
<p> Sony has been rolling out Android 5.1 updates intermittently ever since last July... up to and past the point where Android 6.0's AOSP code has been available to manufacturers. The last few devices that received bumps to 5.1 were the Xperia C4 and C5 Ultra earlier this month, and today the Xperia M5 gets the same treatment. Users can wait for the over-the-air update alert in the usual manner, or use Sony's PC Companion computer program to download and install the update manually. </p>
<p> This "super mid-range" M5 was launched back in August, running Android 5.0 at launch, much to the consternation of Android fans who would have preferred the latest software. </p>
<p> After leaking last week, Sony has made the Xperia M5 official. This device is the spiritual successor to the Xperia M4 Aqua, but it has a more impressive camera. The 21.5MP sensor is joined by Sony's customary waterproof design and a 5-inch 1080p display. </p>
<p> Sony's smartphone division isn't doing great right now, but the company is still pumping out devices like there's no tomorrow (and maybe there isn't). The mid-range Xperia M5 and C5 Ultra have been leaked in full by Hi-Tech.Mail.ru, and one of them has some interesting design ideas. </p>

<p> If tiny smartphones that pack a punch are your thing, then today is your lucky day. Sony Ericsson just officially announced the new Xperia Mini and Xperia Mini Pro, which are both essentially the same phone, except the latter has a full slide out QWERTY. The new line succeeds last year's X10 Mini and X10 Mini Pro, but drops the X10 moniker and heavily beefs up the specs. Here are the details: </p>
<p> 3 Inch 320x480 display </p>
<p> 1GHz Snapdragon processor </p>
<p> 320MB internal storage (ouch), SD Card slot with 2GB card included </p>
<p> 5MP rear camera with 720p video capture and face detection </p>
<p> Sony BRAVIA engine </p>
<p> Android 2.3 </p>
<p> While the pair may not be the hottest thing to hit the streets lately, they definitely have the whole smallest-HD-smartphone thing going for them. </p>

<p> xperia neo v </p>
<p> There must be something weird going on with manufacturers lately - first Huawei released an alpha build of ICS for the Honor, and now Sony Ericsson (soon to be just Sony) has released an ICS ROM for certain unlocked Xperia devices, including the Arc S, Neo V, and Ray. </p>
<p> Since it's an alpha ROM, it's not made for day-to-day use, as it is limited to just a few functions at the moment. </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson has taken a lot of flak in the past for its slow roll-out of Android upgrades, however this no longer appears to be the case as today they have announced that alongside the launch of their newest Android device, the Xperia neo V, all 2011 Xperia smartphones (i.e. the Xperia arc, Xperia PLAY, and Xperia neo) will be upgraded to Android 2.3.4. </p>
<p> The update will bring a number of new features to the Xperia phones including video chat support for Google Talk, easier Facebook integration with "Facebook inside Xperia", swipe text input, screen capture support, and the ability to connect USB peripherals through the Sony Ericsson LiveDock. </p>

<p> According to a post on the Sony Mobile blog, the upgrade process is beginning today and continuing globally "over the next few weeks", so if you're an Xperia P owner, keep an eye out for any upgrade notifications on your phone. When ICS is ready for your device, you will be alerted, but Sony says that some users may have to use their PC Companion software to perform the update. </p>
<p> Owners of Sony Mobile's "WhiteMagic" phone, the Xperia P, have been stuck on pre-4.0 software for some time now. This, needless to say, was no fun at all. </p>
<p> However, as can be seen in the above Facebook post from Sony Mobile India, the device will indeed be getting its proper serving of Ice Cream Sandwich sometime between August 19th and August 25th, just as expected. </p>
<p> And now, the (two-week) wait begins for Xperia P users. </p>
<p> Sony's portfolio of non-Ericsson branded phones has just received two more additions, though they aren't much more than variations than the already-announced Xperia S. </p>
<p> The Xperia P features: a 4-inch "WhiteMagic" display, optimized for viewability in direct sunlight (for comparison, the Xperia S has a 4.3" display). It also features a 1 GHz dual core processor, 8 megapixel camera, NFC, and HDMI connectivity. The Xperia P will also launch alongside the SmartDock, which allows content on the phone's screen to be streamed to a TV. </p>

<p> Smartphones are great; they organize our lives, provide us with news and information, and keep us in touch with friends no matter how far away they may be. Smartphone gloves on the other hand? Not so much. They don't do a great job of keeping your hands warm in the cold weather, and they aren't exactly renowned for their comfort. </p>
<p> Fortunately for Xperia sola users, Sony has you covered. The Ice Cream Sandwich update for the sola, which began today, includes a new feature called "glove mode" which, you guessed it, allows you to wear any pair of gloves and still use your smartphone. </p>
<p> The rollout for all three devices is beginning today and continuing over the next few weeks in global markets, so keep an eye on your notifications if you're eager to update your software. </p>
<p> As well as updating users' devices to Ice Cream Sandwich, this latest update also comes with new Sony media applications, including a new Walkman app. </p>

<p> When touchscreen phones first became mainstream, countless people talked about how "impractical" a touch-only device was. Since then, touch devices have become the norm in the smartphone realm, with basically every modern high-end phone packing at least some sort of touch input. </p>
<p> Sony is taking the touch revolution to a whole new level with the Xperia sola, though, by bringing a new feature to the table called "floating touch" that allows the user to simply hover their finger over items in the browser and highlight them, much like using a mouse. </p>

<p> xperia t </p>
<p> CyanogenMod 13 is the latest version of the popular open source custom ROM. It delivers Android Marshmallow to hundreds of devices, many with no hope of ever receiving an official update. On other hardware, CyanogenMod offers a chance to remove heavy skins and enjoy a mostly stock Android experience. The latest wave of devices receiving version 13 represents both types. </p>
<p> Owners of the Xperia T, TX, and V had a little hope before today that their beloved devices would see some of that KitKat goodness, but now their hopes lay dashed to bits at the feet of Sony's heartless engineers. These devices won't be making the jump to Android 4.4 KitKat, but will continue to live on with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. </p>
<p> Let's forget about KitKat for a moment. A large number of Android devices out there still need an update to the latest version of Jelly Bean, and while many of them will never receive such an OTA, four of Sony's handsets are receiving one this week. The company is rolling out an update to the Xperia T, TX, SP, and V. </p>
<p> In addition to Android 4.3, the OTA brings updated Sony pre-installed apps, more integration between the company's media apps, and the launch of the new "Xperia Themes" custom interface. These are joined with the security enhancements that typically come with newer versions of software. </p>
<p> AT&T started pushing Jelly Bean (4.1.2) to its variant of the Xperia T (the TL) earlier this month, but Rogers apparently wasn't far behind. The Canadian carrier just made the update available to its Xperia T, which should bring all the same goodies that the AT&T and International versions already have. Namely: </p>
<p> Updated, more intuitive versions of Sony Media apps: WALKMAN, Album and Movies Lets you view and access all your photos, videos and tunes in one place. </p>
<p> Increased options for personalization A revamped home screen experience for handling widgets, apps and shortcuts… With up to 7 desktop panes, widgets that auto-resize and actionable notifications, you have complete flexibility to create the interface you want / need with a few simple touches! </p>
<p> I suppose you have to give Sony credit for at least keeping its customers informed. Today, the manufacturer announced an update to its plans for bringing its phones up to Jelly Bean. If you're rocking the Xperia T, Xperia TX, or Xperia V, you should see Android 4.1 "during February and March." Of course, this will depend on what market you're in or which variant you own. </p>
<p> Following those flagships, the Xperia P, Xperia J and Xperia go will start to receive their upgrades starting around the end of March. Following that release, the Xperia S, Xperia SL, Xperia ion and the Xperia acro S will be updated "in the subsequent weeks." </p>
<p> At the beginning of October, AT&T announced the Xperia TL would be available "in the coming weeks." If you've been waiting with bated breath to get your hands on the James Bond phone, November 2 looks like the day to mark on the calendar. </p>
<p> Android 4.0.4 (will be upgraded to 4.1 "following launch") </p>
<p> The Xperia TL will be available for a mere $99 with a two-year agreement, and runs on AT&T's up and coming LTE network. </p>
<p> Sony Xperia TL Available from AT&T Beginning Nov. 2 </p>
<p> Moments ago, CyanogenMod's Google+ page announced that Sony's Xperia T, the flagship device we first covered during IFA 2012, is joining the CyanogenMod device roster, offering a link to the device's Gerrit code review page and a quick James Bond reference. </p>
<p> What's more, the Xperia T's first (experimental) nightly build is already live in CyanogenMod's download center. </p>
<p> If you've got an Xperia T and have been itching for CM goodness "shaken, not stirred," keep a close watch on get.cm (linked below) for the latest nightly builds. </p>
<p> Definition: A "nightly" is a bleeding edge release that is built on a daily basis, usually at night after a full day's worth of new code has been committed. </p>
<p> Sony's new flagship smartphone, the Xperia T, which was announced at IFA last month, is now available to purchase in the UK from Three. </p>
<p> As with most phones on the network, the Xperia T is available with truly unlimited data on the One Plan, which will cost customers £34 a month with an upfront cost of £29. The cheaper Ultimate Internet 500 plan is also available, and will put customers back £30 a month. </p>
<p> Users who don't want to sign up to a contract can buy the phone on Pay As You Go for £399.99 plus a £15 top-up. As long as you top-up £15 every month, you will be able to take advantage of unlimited data along with 3000 texts for 30 days. </p>
<p> Well, look what we have here. It appears an observant shopper got in touch with Android Central this morning with a link to a piece of evidence that is so random it must be real. </p>
<p> A British online phone store called phones4u (shudder) put up some product images for its Xperia T page. What it didn't notice, apparently, was that at least one of the images Sony sent along was for the wrong phone. It's still an Xperia T, but "oops" is probably the best way to describe this leak: </p>
<p> Now, look carefully. Yeah, that's an AT&T logo on the front. </p>
<p> The Sony press conference is going on right now at IFA 2012 in Berlin, Germany, where the company just announced its newest flagship device, the Xperia T. </p>
<p> The Xperia T brings together some of Sony's best technologies into one device: </p>
<p> 4.6" HD Reality Display powered by the Mobile BRAVIA® Engine for razor sharp clarity </p>
<p> 13MP fast capture camera that goes from sleep mode to snap in just over a second </p>
<p> Full 1080p HD video recording capabilities and a 720p HD front camera for the highest quality content </p>
<p> Easy connectivity with ‘One-touch’ function enabled by NFC </p>
<p> PlayStation™ Certified </p>
<p> Latest generation 1.5GHz dual core processor for improved battery life, fast performance and ultra sharp graphics </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/xperia-t2-ultra/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17552857" filename="xperia-t2-ultra">
<p> #Android 5.1, Lollipop rolling out for original #Xperia Z Series & T2 Ultra - please check locally & watch for notifications </p>
<p> According to Sony's official PR team, the Android 5.1 OTA will start going out to the original Xperia Z series and the T2 Ultra. </p>
<p> Xperia owners, watch out. Lollipops are raining from the sky and smashing straight into your screens. If you welcome this phenomenon, don't do anything. These lollipops have heat-seeking sensors and will find your devices wherever they lay. If you prefer KitKat, you can swat the intruders away, but you'll never get to experience the future changes in store for your Android device. </p>
<p> Sony has confirmed that it is launching lollipops at Xperia Z3, Z3 Compact, and Z3 Tablet Compact devices all over the world (some of these updates were previously pushed out to smaller, test markets). The manufacturer plans to open fire on the Z2 and Z2 Tablet starting next week. </p>
<p> Sony has announced an impending software update for the Xperia T2 Ultra and the T2 Ultra Dual that will deliver Android 4.4 to both devices. The update contains the changes introduced by KitKat, but it also tosses in a number of Sony-exclusive touches. </p>
<p> Sony's designers have tweaked the status bar and quick settings to make them easier on the eyes, and they've tossed in new animations at launch and on the homescreen that may look familiar to PlayStation 4 owners. And don't forget about those pre-installed Sony apps. They're getting love too. </p>
<p> Here's the provided list of what to expect. </p>
<p> What's new: </p>
<p> Google’s Android 4.4; KitKat as standard – bringing performance & UI optimisation… </p>
<p> We’ve added our tweaked Status Bar and Quick Settings… now more intuitive and customisable (and pretty easy on the eye)… cleaned up to ensure you only get the notifications you really need </p>
<p> If you’ve got a Sony PlayStation 4, you might recognize our new user interface – we’ve added the same sleek launch animation and livewallpaper across the lock and home screens </p>
<p> We’re also uplifting Sony’s entire native app portfolio to the latest versions – bringing tweaked / improved / current experiences for (to name but a few): Messaging, MyXperia, Smart Connect, Small apps, TrackID, TrackID TV, Sony Select, Smart Social Camera and… </p>
<p> Sony’s Media apps: WALKMAN, Album and Movies, with Sony Entertainment Network cloud service integration* – a more converged and full Sony entertainment experience – Sony Entertainment Network & PlayMemories integration with a more intuitive UI, better download speeds, and more! </p>
<p> Sony's typically quick about releasing the open source underpinnings of its devices. After having announced the Xperia T2 Ultra earlier this year, the company has now made the kernel files for the device available for download. The company's offering these files up for three variants of the device, the D5303, D5322, and XM50h. The software version for the first model is 19.0.1.A.0.207, while the latter two fall under 19.0.D.0.253. </p>
<p> The file size for both versions is 157MB total. These bits aren't of much use to the average consumer, but they're valued assets for developers looking to bring their custom ROMs to Sony's phones. </p>
<p> Two new devices are being added to the Xperia family today in the form of the Xperia E1 and Xperia T2 Ultra. These phones sit below flagship devices like the Z1 and Z1 Ultra, but they still have that slick Sony design and the OEM's custom build of Android 4.3. </p>

<p> Xperia T3 </p>
<p> Sony hasn't always been the best at updating its phones, but the company does have a commitment to AOSP unlike most others. It contributes a lot of code to Android, and developers are encouraged to tinker with unlocked devices. In fact, Sony has just announced support for AOSP on the Xperia E3 and Xperia T3, meaning all Qualcomm-based phones from 2014 can run pure Android with very little hassle. </p>
<p> The mid-range market continues to expand into larger and larger handsets, and Sony doesn't want to be left behind. To that end, they've announced the Xperia T3, a 5.3-inch Android phone with an awesome industrial design, but internals that will leave hardware buffs wanting more. The star of the show is an all-steel body that's admirably thin at just 7mm. It will be available globally in late July. </p>
<p> Move past the admittedly pretty body (available in white, black, or purple), and you'll see hardware that's shooting for the bottom of the mid-range. </p>

<p> xperia tablet s </p>
<p> Owners of Sony's Xperia Tablet S, it's time to get excited. Sony just announced that Jelly Bean (Android 4.1.1 in this case) will hit its production servers tomorrow morning between 9AM and 10AM PST, which means an OTA is on its way. </p>
<p> OK, Sony may have missed the mark on pricing when it first announced the Xperia Tablet S. At $400 for the 16GB version, it priced the device way out of the market, especially when the Nexus 10 is brought into consideration. Sure, the prices may be the same, but not only does the N10 pack a much higher resolution display, but it also has all the benefits of being a Nexus. </p>
<p> Just a month after releasing its new 'durable and splash-proof' Xperia Tablet S, Sony has found that some units have gaps between the screen and the aluminum case, making them particularly vulnerable to water damage. </p>
<p> The issue has been caused by a manufacturing flaw at the Chinese plant where the tablet is produced, and as a result, Sony has chosen to temporarily stop selling the device until the problem can be resolved. </p>
<p> When Sony announced its newest tablet last week at IFA, the Xperia Tablet S, we wondered how they'd price the device. It didn't take long before we learned that info, and as expected, it was priced out of the market. At $399 for the 16GB version, $499 for the 32GB, and $599 for the 64GB version, it was clear that Sony didn't take into consideration the competition. </p>
<p> Today, in an interview with Reuters, an executive VP with Sony, Kunimasa Suzuki, verified exactly that to be true. </p>
<p> Sony announced the Xperia Tablet S - its new flagship tablet - earlier today, and it's already available for pre-order from Amazon. </p>
<p> This is Sony's successor to last year's Tablet S, and packs a nice upgrade in the spec department: </p>
<p> Slim new aluminum body and splash-proof design </p>
<p> 9.4” HD display with OptiContrast Panel with low-friction coating </p>
<p> NVIDIA® Tegra® 3 quad-core processor and Android 4.0.3 operating system </p>
<p> 1GB RAM </p>
<p> We first caught a glimpse of Sony's upcoming flagship tablet back at the end of July, and now it's official. Dubbed the Xperia Tablet S, it's undeniably the successor to last year's Tablet S. The specs from the aforementioned leak were essentially spot on: </p>
<p> Slim new aluminium body and splash-proof design </p>
<p> 9.4” HD display with OptiContrast™ Panel with low-friction coating </p>
<p> NVIDIA® Tegra® 3 quad-core processor and Android 4.0.3 operating system </p>
<p> Android version 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich) </p>
<p> Various experiences with original applications and Sony’s network services </p>
<p> Optimized accessories (sold separately) to enhance experiences in every scene </p>

<p> xperia t jelly bean </p>
<p> Sony is firing off Jelly Bean updates for a few handsets this week, starting with the Xperia T and V, with the TX to receive its Android 4.1 update in March. This conforms with the statement Sony issued previously about updates to these devices, back in December. Here's what Sony says is contained in the update: </p>
<p> Updated, more intuitive versions of Sony Media apps: WALKMAN, Album and Movies </p>
<p> A slick, easy-on-the-eye library that lets you view and access all your snaps, videos and tunes in one place – not to mention the signature Sony audio and imaging tech that makes your content stand (and shout) out! </p>
<p> Way back in December 2011, Sony began releasing 'alpha' developer ROMs for some of its phones being upgraded to Android 4.0. Then it released beta ROMs that did slightly more stuff. Now it's done the same with Android 4.1 for the Xperia T. </p>
<p> These ROMs are developer-facing in every sense of the word, though, and aren't intended as a way for power users to get early access to the next version of Android. </p>

<p> xperia tl </p>
<p> Ice Cream Sandwich may have been good enough for James Bond, but the Android die-hards who nabbed Sony's Xperia TL on AT&T want more. And by "more," we mean "an update to a newer version of Android." Fortunately, that's finally available. </p>
<p> Update: Looks like AT&T just started pushing the update over-the-air if you don't want to deal with flashing it manually. Head into Settings > About Phone > Software update to grab it. </p>
<p> If you head on over to Amazon Wireless this morning, you'll find the Xperia TL has had its price dropped to a mere penny on contract (new subscribers or upgrades). </p>
<p> The Xperia TL is Sony's current flagship smartphone, and packs a 4.6" 720p display, 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 processor, LTE, and a 13MP Exmor rear camera. At the low, low, price of "basically free," this is a pretty decent deal - $100 less than what you'd pay at an AT&T store. </p>
<p> It's a big day for AT&T devices! For starters, the headlining LG phone that's managed to grab our attention as the best not-a-Nexus device the company has put out in recent memory. The LG Optimus G goes on sale today on the nation's #2 carrier for $199 with a two-year contract. Of course, for $100 more you can pick up a Nexus 4 from the Play Store, though you'll lack LTE. </p>
<p> At the beginning of October, AT&T announced the Xperia TL would be available "in the coming weeks." If you've been waiting with bated breath to get your hands on the James Bond phone, November 2 looks like the day to mark on the calendar. </p>
<p> Android 4.0.4 (will be upgraded to 4.1 "following launch") </p>
<p> The Xperia TL will be available for a mere $99 with a two-year agreement, and runs on AT&T's up and coming LTE network. </p>
<p> AT&T just announced the James Bond phone, otherwise known as the Sony Xperia TL, will be the newest edition to its 4G LTE lineup. First announced back at IFA, the Xperia TL is Sony's newest offering to the high-end world: </p>
<p> 4.6" 1280x720 "Reality Display" </p>
<p> 1.5GHz dual-core processor </p>
<p> 13MP fast capture camera </p>
<p> NFC </p>
<p> Android 4.0.4 (will be upgraded to 4.1 "following launch") </p>
<p> The press release is pretty scant on release details, stating only that it will be available "in the coming weeks." </p>

<p> xperia tx </p>
<p> CyanogenMod 13 is the latest version of the popular open source custom ROM. It delivers Android Marshmallow to hundreds of devices, many with no hope of ever receiving an official update. On other hardware, CyanogenMod offers a chance to remove heavy skins and enjoy a mostly stock Android experience. The latest wave of devices receiving version 13 represents both types. </p>
<p> Team Win Recovery Project is the de facto standard for Android custom recoveries. While the open-source project often makes its way to disparate Android phones and tablets by the efforts of interested indie ROM developers, the maintainers of the project work tirelessly to bring official builds out as well. Today no less than seven new devices get the official treatment, and most of them are more niche, low-volume hardware that might not get major attention otherwise. </p>
<p> Owners of the Xperia T, TX, and V had a little hope before today that their beloved devices would see some of that KitKat goodness, but now their hopes lay dashed to bits at the feet of Sony's heartless engineers. These devices won't be making the jump to Android 4.4 KitKat, but will continue to live on with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. </p>
<p> Let's forget about KitKat for a moment. A large number of Android devices out there still need an update to the latest version of Jelly Bean, and while many of them will never receive such an OTA, four of Sony's handsets are receiving one this week.

<p> Back in early February when Sony started pushing Jelly Bean to the Xperia T and V, it promised the same update for the TX by "the end of March." Here we are, with four days left in the month, and Sony has made good on that promise. You hear that, all other manufacturers? </p>
<p> At this time it's not completely clear what enhancements this brings outside of stock Jelly Bean's improvements, but it's likely similar to that of the Xperia T, V, and TL. Here's a look at that changelog: </p>
<p> Updated, more intuitive versions of Sony Media apps: WALKMAN, Album and Movies Lets you view and access all your photos, videos and tunes in one place. </p>

<p> The rollout for all three devices is beginning today and continuing over the next few weeks in global markets, so keep an eye on your notifications if you're eager to update your software. </p>
<p> As well as updating users' devices to Ice Cream Sandwich, this latest update also comes with new Sony media applications, including a new Walkman app. </p>
<p> How often do you hear this? Sony has started to roll out Ice Cream Sandwich to the Xperia P ahead of schedule, beating its own date of August 19th. </p>
<p> According to a post on the Sony Mobile blog, the upgrade process is beginning today and continuing globally "over the next few weeks", so if you're an Xperia P owner, keep an eye out for any upgrade notifications on your phone. When ICS is ready for your device, you will be alerted, but Sony says that some users may have to use their PC Companion software to perform the update. </p>
<p> Sony's portfolio of non-Ericsson branded phones has just received two more additions, though they aren't much more than variations than the already-announced Xperia S. </p>
<p> The Xperia P features: a 4-inch "WhiteMagic" display, optimized for viewability in direct sunlight (for comparison, the Xperia S has a 4.3" display). It also features a 1 GHz dual core processor, 8 megapixel camera, NFC, and HDMI connectivity. The Xperia P will also launch alongside the SmartDock, which allows content on the phone's screen to be streamed to a TV. </p>

<p> Sony, as part of a trio of new phones, today announced the Xperia V at IFA. The Xperia V carries specs similar to the newly-announced Xperia T, but has a unique twist: the device is water and dust resistant, with the ability to withstand full submersion as deep as a meter for an estimated thirty minutes. </p>
<p> Those who enjoy promotional videos may also be interested in seeing Sony's "Xperia – Designing out Smartphones" video, which takes a look at just how this new lineup of devices came to be. </p>
<p> Besides water resistance, the Xperia V carries some impressive-sounding specs, from a 13MP camera to a 4.3" HD Reality Display powered by Sony's Mobile BRAVIA Engine. </p>

<p> Xperia X10 (es209ra) </p>
<p> Update: It looks like someone in Sony's camp got a little overzealous concerning this update, as it's actually not available just yet. According to the Sony Ericsson Product Blog, the launch is coming, but "[they] just need more days before [they] can push the button." We'll keep you posted of any developments on this front -- like, you know, when it's actually available. </p>
<p> Owners of the Sony Erricsson Xperia X10, make ready your computers - the official Gingerbread update is ready and available to download. </p>
<p> We first told you back in March that Sony would be bringing Gingerbread to non-carrier-branded Xperia X10 units, with a late Q2/early Q3 arrival. With the end of Q2 quickly approaching, Sony posted a new entry on its Product Blog this morning stating that "the current plan is [to] start the roll-out [at] the beginning of August," which hits the early Q3 target date right on the head. </p>
<p> This update will include the same camera app that is found in the Éclair version (this has apparently been a pretty big issue amongst X10 owners), as well as a lot of features found on the newer Xperia phones - like Facebook inside Xperia, the updated UI with pinch-to-overview, and an integrated EQ in the music player. </p>
<p> In this line of work, I get the chance to write about things that are new and exciting. Other times, however, that's just not the case. There are times when writing about certain subjects just makes me sad... and this is one of those times. Sure, it may be good news in a sense, but the fact that I am sitting here, on May 31, 2011, reporting an update to Android 2.1... </p>
<p> Owners of the Sony Xperia X10 around the world are rejoicing, because after a long wait, the previously locked bootloader has finally been cracked. What does this mean, you ask? In a nutshell, it means that the X10 can now handle custom features that other Android devices have had for some time, like kernels that allow for overclocking/undervolting, native USB/Wi-Fi tethering, removal of the 32fps cap, and a myriad of other tweaks. </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson has confirmed that it will not be updating its Xperia X10 line of smartphones to Android 2.2 Froyo. So, owners of the Xperia X10, X10 Mini and X10 Mini Pro will be stuck on Android 2.1 Éclair for the foreseeable future. However, Sony Ericsson has promised to provide some minor software updates, with features such as multitouch, later this year. </p>
<p> If you were looking for another reason to buy Google's Nexus S, here it is. </p>
<p> Amazon Wireless, Amazon's mobile arm, launched a big sale on all AT&T Android phones today in a weekend promotion that could easily rival even the upcoming Black Friday deals (BF is happening on Nov 25th). All of the AT&T Android phones Amazon Wireless carries are temporarily exactly 1 penny: </p>
<p> Motorola Flipout </p>
<p> Motorola Flipside </p>
<p> In addition to the above, a few other Android and some Win Phone 7 (if you're into that sort of thing) phones are also bearing the sweet sticker price of a mere cent: </p>
<p> Motorola Droid 2 </p>
<p> Motorola Citrus </p>
<p> HTC Surround (Win Phone 7) </p>
<p> Right on time, Sony Ericsson's begun rolling out the update to Android 2.1 Eclair (build number 2.0.A.0.504) for the Xperia X10, X10 Mini, and X10 Mini Pro. Judging by what we're seeing on Twitter and from what our tipster told us, it's only available in Scandinavia for now, so we can only hope that other regions will get to join in on the fun soon enough. </p>
<p> Our tipster also mentioned that Universal Androot does not work, although a bit of digging through the forums revealed that SuperOneClick does indeed root the phones, even after the update. </p>
<p> This morning Sony Ericsson posted a teaser video on YouTube explaining to X10 users the differences they will find in the update from Android 1.6 to 2.1. As painful as it is to watch a video of someone demonstrating five homescreens, slide-to-unlock and live wallpapers like they're brand new features, the video underscores the growing expectation that an update will be released for the X10 within the next few days. </p>
<p> (Note – It does have some wording on getting the update now – that is not yet really valid and it wasn’t scheduled to be released until the update is out there. </p>
<p> Who thinks strictly black and gray phones are gloomy and boring? I do and, thankfully, so does Best Buy. A few months ago, the retailer announced an exclusive white EVO 4G, and today we got word of not 1 but 2 more white Android phones arriving on October 24: Verizon's Samsung Fascinate and AT&T's slightly outdated Sony Ericsson Xperia X10. While the exact pricing on either of these is unknown, you can head over to Best Buy today and reserve the device of your dreams with a $50 deposit. </p>

<p> Xperia X10 Mini / Mini Pro (Robyn / Mimmi) </p>
<p> Sure, Sony Ericsson's XPERIA arc is getting all of the attention right now, but the folks at the IT168 forums have posted specs and a pair of images of a supposed XPERIA X10 Mini Pro follow-up. </p>
<p> The poster lists this unnamed device as having an Adreno 205 GPU, 384MB RAM, and a "7230 CPU". No clock speed is listed, but it's safe to assume that "7230" refers to the Qualcomm MSM7230 processor which recently made an appearance in HTC's Desire Z/G2 running at 800MHz, though it is also capable of running at up to 1GHz. </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson has confirmed that it will not be updating its Xperia X10 line of smartphones to Android 2.2 Froyo. So, owners of the Xperia X10, X10 Mini and X10 Mini Pro will be stuck on Android 2.1 Éclair for the foreseeable future. However, Sony Ericsson has promised to provide some minor software updates, with features such as multitouch, later this year. </p>
<p> If you were looking for another reason to buy Google's Nexus S, here it is. </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson has always had upgrade issues when it came to Android - with the X10, the X10 Mini, and the X10 Mini Pro just recently receiving the update to Éclair (2.1), the majority of Xperia users have been deprived of the numerous features available in Android 2.x. Recently, with leaks of the Playstation Phone (a.k.a. Xperia Play) and the Anzu (a.k.a. X12), it has been made clear that Sony is most likely coming with back with a storm of devices with up-to-date firmware and its usual competitive hardware. </p>
<p> This morning Sony Ericsson posted a teaser video on YouTube explaining to X10 users the differences they will find in the update from Android 1.6 to 2.1. As painful as it is to watch a video of someone demonstrating five homescreens, slide-to-unlock and live wallpapers like they're brand new features, the video underscores the growing expectation that an update will be released for the X10 within the next few days. </p>
<p> (Note – It does have some wording on getting the update now – that is not yet really valid and it wasn’t scheduled to be released until the update is out there. </p>
<p> You didn’t think the unboxing goodness was over did you? Well just in case the Captivate and Intercept didn’t quite fill your appetite, here’s a two-in-one unboxing for you: Sony Ericsson’s XPERIA X10 Mini and X10 Mini Pro. </p>
<p> In November 2009, Sony Ericsson announced its entry into the Android arena by adding the X10 to its XPERIA line. Three short months later, SE decided to put the X10 under a shrink-ray to create the X10 Mini and X10 Mini Pro. </p>
<p> You know the drama with the XPERIA X10 multitouch support? The one where it was supposedly possible, then not, then possible again, then refuted for good? </p>
<p> X10 Mini/Mini Pro Multitouch </p>
<p> Single handed operation seems to be the theme throughout their whole post, insisting that even though the users clearly want multitouch, the devices are better without it (who are the users to dictate what's better, eh?): </p>

<p> The 30-hour event known as Prime Day has officially kicked off, and we have a list of ten Android phones, tablets, and Chromebooks that will be included at different times during the sale. For the uninitiated, the sales on Prime Day are staggered, the better to consistently pull your attention throughout the day. So most of the items that will be included haven't yet gone on sale. But, worry not, as with this list you'll be prepared. </p>
<p> Not to be forgotten to the passing of time, it appears that the Sony Xperia XA Ultra has started receiving a substantial update. Nougat is finally coming to the year-old phone, and not a moment too soon, either. </p>
<p> Unlocked phones are great. You can take them to whichever carrier you desire, you usually have greater control over software modification, and you don't have to deal with contracts. Amazon seems to think so, too; as a result, it's running an "Amazon Unlocked Phone Event" that starts today, with discounts on Sony Xperia, LeEco, Lenovo, ASUS, and Coolpad smartphones. </p>
<p> The budget smartphone segment in America seems to be a shrinking one of late (well, at least of good options), but we've rounded up the best we think the market has to offer consumers right now in the $250-and-under segment. The selected phones are presented in no particular order. </p>
<p> The Xperia X line is decent, but considerably behind competitors from Samsung and LG this year, with prices that border on the astronomical for their features. So what happens when you price your flagship phones too high and nobody buys them? Discounts, baby. Best Buy is already offering the mid-range Xperia X and flagship Xperia X Performance for considerably less than retail, and as unlocked GSM phones, too - no carrier shenanigans to be seen. </p>
<p> Sony has long been (rightly) criticized for ignoring the US market, opting to release phones here very late or not at all. In the case of the Marshmallow-powered Xperia X series, it's just a little late. These devices were announced at Mobile World Congress a few months ago with only vague talk about a US release, but now all four models are coming to the US in waves. It starts today with pre-orders for the Xperia X. </p>
<p> Even though Sony hasn't released the Xperia X, XA, or X Performance yet, it's still busy announcing new phones in the range. The latest to be unveiled is the Xperia XA Ultra, a phone with a curved glass screen and a 16MP front-facing camera. </p>
<p> The highlight here is obviously that front-facing camera. It has optical image stabilisation, like the HTC 10, and a wide angle 88 degrees lens. It's also got HDR, which is good for those low-light selfies. The rear camera isn't half bad either: 21.5MP, HDR, and 5x Clear Image Zoom, which presumably means digital zoom doesn't affect the image quality or something. </p>
<p> Here at MWC in Barcelona this morning, Sony announced an all-new series of Xperia devices: the X series. Sorry, folks - no Z6 to be found here. But the X Performance may pique your interest regardless. We had a chance to play with the X and XA (the X Performance was not being shown, just dummy units), so let's talk specs and first thoughts. </p>
<p> The Xperia XA sits at the bottom of the X heap, with a MediaTek MT6755 processor, 2GB of RAM, 5" 720p display, 13MP/8MP cameras, 16GB of storage, and a 2300mAh battery. </p>

<p> xperia xa1 </p>
<p> The Xperia XA1 debuted back in February of 2017 as one of Sony's latest "super mid-range" phones. It's since been succeeded by the XA2, but that means that the XA1 can now be found for not a lot of money. Amazon currently has the XA1 for $180 with free one-day shipping, and Focus Camera has it for $189.99 with no tax depending on where you live. </p>
<p> Sony is usually quick to update their phones to the latest version of Android, but like many other manufacturers, it usually leaves the budget devices for last. The Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra were launched a year ago, both with MediaTek Helio P20 chips and impressive 23MP back cameras. Now the XA1, XA1 Plus, and XA1 Ultra are being updated to Android 8.0 Oreo. </p>
<p> It's Sony-day at MWC today with the introduction of the new flagship XZ2 and XZ2 Compact, but if you love the company's phones and can't wait for these devices to be available and you're on a limited budget, now is a good time to take a hard look at the Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra. Both phones are being discounted through several retailers and are now, if you ask me, much more realistically priced. </p>
<p> These days, many manufacturers include some sort of blue light filter or "night light" in their phones' ROMs. Google, Samsung, OnePlus, and some other companies are on the list, and Sony was as well with its "Good night actions" function in Xperia Actions for phones in the XA1 family. However, following the impending Oreo updates, no Sony phone will have a built-in blue light filter. </p>
<p> Back in February, Sony announced two new budget phones - the XA1 and XA1 Ultra. Comparable to the Moto G and G Plus respectively, Sony calls these devices "super mid-range." Now the XA1 has showed up for pre-order on Amazon and Best Buy for $299, in Black, Gold, Pink, and White. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/xperia-x-performance/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17548714" filename="xperia-x-performance">
<p> Every month or so, an update to ARCore rolls out to add the augmented reality framework to a whole new set of phones, tablets... and now Chromebooks? Yes, the first Chrome OS device has been found among the list of profiles included in the ARCore APK, and that is the recently released Acer Chromebook Tab 10. Also joining the list are the codenames associated with the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, blueline and crosshatch, which are due out this Fall. </p>
<p> Sony's new Xperia X line of phones was considered a bit overpriced when it launched. However, as all phones tend to do after time, they've since dropped in price. Today, you can grab an Xperia X Performance for only $299.99 - a full $200 off the sticker price. If you've been looking to grab a cheap Sony with mid- to high-end specs, now may be the time. </p>
<p> It's been a few months since Android 7.0 hit the AOSP code repository, and this is about the time of year that owners of non-Nexus (non-Pixel, now) flagships start to ask why their upgrades are taking so long. Well if your flagship just happens to be the latest high-powered Sony smartphone, you're in luck. The Xperia X Performance is receiving its Nougat update starting today, according to XperiaBlog. For the record, that's just a little over three months of waiting for the upgrade - not bad by current Android standards. </p>
<p> TWRP is by far the most popular custom recovery, and for good reason. Backing up your device, flashing ROMs, managing files in a pinch, and more are all possible through a customizable GUI. Now TWRP is expanding its reach to three more devices - the Sony Xperia XZ, Sony Xperia X Performance, and Samsung Galaxy J3 2016 Qualcomm (SM-J320YZ). </p>
<p> Considering the XZ was only released a week ago, this is pretty fast work from the TWRP maintainers. The other devices are a bit older, with the Xperia X Performance released in June of this year and the Galaxy J3 in January. </p>
<p> The Xperia X line is decent, but considerably behind competitors from Samsung and LG this year, with prices that border on the astronomical for their features. So what happens when you price your flagship phones too high and nobody buys them? Discounts, baby. Best Buy is already offering the mid-range Xperia X and flagship Xperia X Performance for considerably less than retail, and as unlocked GSM phones, too - no carrier shenanigans to be seen. </p>
<p> The beta, which Sony is calling the Xperia Beta Program, is currently only available to Xperia X Performance users in European countries (specifically Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands). Sony has not commented on whether it plans to expand the beta's reach. </p>
<p> When Ryan looked at the Xperia X Performance last month, his verdict was that it had a nice display, decent specs, but deal breakers like the lack of a fingerprint scanner and the poor camera left a sour taste in his mouth. That was nothing though compared to the shock of the price of the phone. $700. There are many, many better phones selling for that much and even less, so Sony's value proposition just seems ridiculous. </p>
<p> At a discounted price though, you could make a case for the X Performance. It does have a nice display after all, a solid build, a Snapdragon 820, IP68 water resistance (a bit of a rare feat still), 3GB of RAM, and if the camera's software is tweaked, it could yield good photos. </p>
<p> Sony is now accepting pre-orders for its line of Xperia X phones in the US, including the X and X Performance. We've already covered the Xperia X in detail, learning that it's a disappointing phone. But what of the top-of-the-line Xperia X Performance? It solves a few of the issues with the Xperia X, but it comes with a much higher $700 price tag. Is this the Sony phone you should buy, or should you buy none of them? Let's use the Xperia X as a thoroughly mediocre and overpriced yardstick to find out. </p>
<p> Sony has long been (rightly) criticized for ignoring the US market, opting to release phones here very late or not at all. In the case of the Marshmallow-powered Xperia X series, it's just a little late. These devices were announced at Mobile World Congress a few months ago with only vague talk about a US release, but now all four models are coming to the US in waves. It starts today with pre-orders for the Xperia X. </p>
<p> Pour one out for the Xperia Z series. It's served Sony well since 2013, going through a relatively rapid five generations in under three years, plus offshoots like the massive Xperia Z Ultra, the diminutive Xperia Z Compact and its well-regarded descendants, and even a tablet or two. But all things must pass away, and so it is with the Z moniker. Probably. There won't be an Xperia Z6 at any rate, at least according to the statement that the company gave to XperiaBlog. </p>

<p> Sony's phones don't have a working fingerprint sensor in the US, have confusing names, and are almost always expensive. But software updates is where Sony really shines, and now the company is updating two more phones to Oreo. </p>
<p> I think my favorite part of the holiday season is all of the sales that you can find on various items. Among those, phones are commonplace. It's a great time to pick up yesteryear's goodies at very low prices. This Deal Alert is just that: B&H has the black Sony Xperia XZ (F8331) for $304.99, saving you $70. </p>
<p> The Sony Xperia XZ debuted in the US with a rather astronomical MSRP of $700, but ten months later, the price has calmed down to more reasonable levels. This latest figure of $399.99 with a free 64GB microSD card is one of the best offers we've seen yet, and it's available for all three colors. </p>
<p> I've never actually seen anyone with an Xperia smartphone here in the United States, but presumably someone is buying them, because Sony still sells them here. The latest entry in Sony's line of devices, the Xperia XZ Premium, is now available to purchase in 'Murica for a penny shy of $800. </p>
<p> Did you like the Xperia XZ, but find it a crippling flaw that it couldn't shoot video in super slow-motion? Well, you're in luck, as the Xperia XZs is now available for purchase. It's capable of shooting a whopping 960fps with its new Exmor RS sensor. In the US, Amazon will sell you one of these bad boys for $699. </p>
<p> Sony has the tendency to significantly over-price its phones, with the Xperia XZ from last year being no exception. Since its launch a few months ago, it has steadily dropped in price. But now, you can grab one for $429.99, which a nice savings of $220. Oh, and you get free standard shipping and a U.S. warranty to boot. </p>
<p> The Sony Xperia XZ was announced at IFA last year, and later released in the United States in October. As you might expect from a phone initially costing $699, it's powered by a Snapdragon 820 CPU with 3GB of RAM. Now Xperia Blog has posted the first image of the upcoming XZ Premium, and it's very shiny. </p>
<p> One tradition with Sony smartphones is that they are nearly always overpriced at launch. Sony's latest flagship, the 2016 Xperia XZ, was no exception - it started at a whopping $699. Although the official MSRP has been marked down to $649 since then, you can now get it from Amazon for just $449.99. </p>
<p> B&H is one of my favorite stores. It is always dependable, most of the time has very good prices, and customer service is great as well. They are running a DealZone sale on a couple of Xperia phones and a JBL Pulse 2 Bluetooth speaker, among other things. Hurry up, it's a flash sale that will expire soon. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ hasn't been out for long in the United States, but its prices just keep dropping. Just a few days ago, this very phone went from its MSRP of $649.99 to as low as $581.98, but now, it's gone down another $80 or so to $499.99. That's a pretty damn good price for such a new device, even if you have to flash different firmware to get the fingerprint sensor to work. </p>

<p> Xperia XZ1 </p>
<p> Are you ready for a surprise? Paranoid Android/AOSPA, of long-standing ROM fame, has just pushed out a status update on the project's plans, as well as the first ever Oreo releases for the ROM. Unfortunately for the vast majority of us, they're only available for a handful of Sony phones. </p>
<p> Sony's Xperia XZ1 really isn't a bad phone if you can get over its 1080p display. The starting price of $699.99 was a little ambitious, but we've seen a couple of price drops since then. This latest deal marks the lowest price that we've seen thus far for the XZ1: $495, over $200 off the MSRP. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ1 was originally announced at IFA 2017, and it arrived in the United States in September. The original price was a whopping $699.99, but as usual, the price started to fall shortly after launch. The XZ1 dropped to $599 back in November, and now you can get the 'Warm Silver' model for $543.44 from Amazon. </p>
<p> Android phone buyers have been begging Google for years to do something about the platform's typically slow updates. As of this month, Android 8.0 Oreo only has 0.3% market share among Android devices, Marshmallow (released in 2015) is still at 30%, and Lollipop (from 2014) sits at 27%. Google's latest attempt to solve this problem is 'Project Treble,' a major restructuring of Android that is part of 8.0 Oreo. </p>
<p> Most of you may be under the impression that Google's Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will be the first phones out with Android 8.0 Oreo. But it's not those two, or even the LG V30, that can claim that honor; it's actually Sony's Xperia XZ1. And now, you can grab one of these Oreo-toting phones for just a hair over $605 on Amazon through Focus Camera, with no tax charged unless you're in New York or New Jersey. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ1 is Sony's latest flagship, released less than a month ago in the United States. It's probably not the prettiest phone released this year, and it's fairly expensive (like all Sony phones), but it's not a bad device by any means. If you were looking to buy one, you'll be happy to know that it's already $50 off on Amazon (making the total $650). </p>
<p> We're in the thick of the holiday phone season, what with Apple's 2017 lineup on the table, Samsung's Note 8 available, and the Pixel announcement next week. Not to be deterred by all of that, Sony has opened up pre-orders for its next phone, the Xperia XZ1 Compact. </p>
<p> The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL may have leaked today, but we've still got around two weeks until they officially launch. So if you need a 2017 phone running Android 8.0 Oreo, you currently have one option: the Sony Xperia XZ1. That's right - the first phone to ship with Oreo isn't a Pixel, or even a Samsung or LG; it's a Sony. </p>
<p> In the past few months, Netflix has added HDR streaming support on a few devices including the Xperia XZ Premium and LG V30, and now two new phones announced in the past weeks have joined the fold: the Samsung Galaxy Note8 and the Sony Xperia XZ1. </p>
<p> The Note8 is the first Samsung device to be officially Netflix HDR compatible. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, despite having the required HDR displays, still haven't been officially green-lighted by Netflix to the dismay of many a user. The same can be said of Samsung's Galaxy Tab S3. It's good that those who put down almost $1k for the Note8 won't have to wait or wonder whether their shiny new phone will have it, but it'd be even better if those previous devices would get the official support soon. </p>

<p> xperia xz1 compact </p>
<p> Are you ready for a surprise? Paranoid Android/AOSPA, of long-standing ROM fame, has just pushed out a status update on the project's plans, as well as the first ever Oreo releases for the ROM. Unfortunately for the vast majority of us, they're only available for a handful of Sony phones. </p>
<p> Phones are getting massive, and even the smaller versions of Android flagships these days aren't all that small. The Pixel 2 has a 5.0" display, the Galaxy S8 a 5.8" unit (the 18:9 ratio skews that a bit), the P20 a 5.8-incher, and so on. Sony is the only holdout in the game with its 4.6" Xperia XZ1 Compact. If you long for a phone that you can easily use one-handed, this phone might be your match. It's currently down to an all-time low of $399.99 on Best Buy and Amazon, as well as $379.99 on B&H if you like pink. </p>
<p> Android phone buyers have been begging Google for years to do something about the platform's typically slow updates. As of this month, Android 8.0 Oreo only has 0.3% market share among Android devices, Marshmallow (released in 2015) is still at 30%, and Lollipop (from 2014) sits at 27%. Google's latest attempt to solve this problem is 'Project Treble,' a major restructuring of Android that is part of 8.0 Oreo. </p>
<p> Remember when we all thought the Galaxy Nexus's 4.65" display was enormous? Those days are long gone, but thankfully, Sony will still sell you a flagship with a screen about that large. The Xperia XZ1 Compact, originally priced at $599.99, has dropped to just $449 on eBay with a coupon code. Alternatively, you can grab one from Best Buy for $499.99 and get a free $50 gift card included. </p>
<p> Today, virtually the smallest mainstream Android flagship on the market is the 5.0" Pixel 2. That's a nice phone, but it's pricey and might still be too big for your liking. It's a good thing that the Xperia XZ1 Compact exists, then, and it's even better that it's currently discounted on Amazon to just $504.99. That's nearly $100 off on a still-new phone. </p>

<p> Sony is having a hard time in the smartphone business amidst declining sales and shrinking market share, but its users are likely more distressed right now. Many existing Sony users found that the recent Android 10 update broke their 2018 flagships almost universally, with no official communication from the company. In what appears to be a widespread issue, the affected Xperia XZ3 and XZ2 owners rallied on community platforms like Reddit complaining about a long list of bugs, including terrible RAM management, high battery consumption, app fails, and a generally sluggish UI. </p>
<p> Despite continuing losses in its mobile business sector, Sony still churns out phone after phone, much to the delight of its ardent fan base. It also maintains its existing lineup with new software updates and, just like many other manufacturers before it, the company has just shared when which of its devices will receive Android 10. </p>
<p> Today is another day for phone deals. Right now, you can pick up a Sony Xperia XZ2 from either Amazon or Best for $449.99, a savings of $50. That's a really decent price for a Snapdragon 845 device. </p>
<p> Unlike many OEMs, Sony is actually pretty good at launching its phones with the latest build of Android. The Xperia XZ1 was the first phone to ship with Android 8.0 Oreo, and the XZ3 was the first to ship with Android 9 Pie. The XZ2 wasn't as unique as its siblings in that regard, but it is among the first to receive the Android 9 Pie update. </p>
<p> ARCore's list of supported devices was just updated earlier this month, but with the introductions of so many new Android devices, a second revision for the month of August was required. Samsung's latest and greatest, the Galaxy Note9 and Galaxy Tab S4, are present, as are all three members of the Xperia XZ2 line and the Nokia 6.1 Plus. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ2 and XZ2 Compact were released earlier this year, and both are a significant design departure from Sony's previous devices. They have 18:9 displays, rear fingerprint sensors (that are actually enabled in the North America!), and glossy glass backs. Now you can get the XZ2 for $649.99 on B&H - a $150 discount from the MSRP, and about $50 lower than current prices at other retailers. </p>
<p> Every month or so, an update to ARCore rolls out to add the augmented reality framework to a whole new set of phones, tablets... and now Chromebooks? Yes, the first Chrome OS device has been found among the list of profiles included in the ARCore APK, and that is the recently released Acer Chromebook Tab 10. Also joining the list are the codenames associated with the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, blueline and crosshatch, which are due out this Fall. </p>
<p> It has been a big week for deals here at Android Police, and better still, a whole bunch of them are still going strong, as their savings continue to be available for shoppers looking to take advantage. Whether you're shopping for a new phone, some smart-home accessories, or just looking for a new source of entertainment, these deals have got you covered. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ2 and XZ2 Compact were announced less than two months ago, but they're already seeing some nice discounts. The larger XZ2 is down to $699.99, $100 off its MSRP, and the XZ2 Compact has dropped to $599.99 ($50 off). Amazon, B&H, and Best Buy are all offering these discounts. </p>

<p> Despite continuing losses in its mobile business sector, Sony still churns out phone after phone, much to the delight of its ardent fan base. It also maintains its existing lineup with new software updates and, just like many other manufacturers before it, the company has just shared when which of its devices will receive Android 10. </p>
<p> If you've wanted a small phone, you'll find precious few in the marketplace. In the past year, we've had the new Palm Phone — framed as a companion device meant to stay out of the way of your life — and the Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact, which had a 5-inch display and all the trimmings of a 2018 flagship smartphone. If you're looking for an upgrade from your much older, tiny device, the good news is that the XZ2 Compact has taken another price drop. </p>
<p> It's OK to admit it — you messed up. You thought we were still in the middle of November or something, and that you had weeks left to do your holiday shopping. Well, after you consult with your neurologist about these concerning lost-time events, you can still scramble to pick up a few last-minute holiday deals, with plenty of offers still available on our favorite mobile tech. </p>
<p> Unlike many OEMs, Sony is actually pretty good at launching its phones with the latest build of Android. The Xperia XZ1 was the first phone to ship with Android 8.0 Oreo, and the XZ3 was the first to ship with Android 9 Pie. The XZ2 wasn't as unique as its siblings in that regard, but it is among the first to receive the Android 9 Pie update. </p>
<p> With this year's IFA expo now squarely behind us, it's finally time for a return to some modicum of normalcy. As we shake off the jet lag and catch up with everything else that's been going on, we're taking a look back at some of the best tech deals to surface over the course of the last week. And whether you're in the market for a new phone, some old home-entertainment hardware, or just a few accessories, we've got you covered. </p>
<p> The Sony Xperia XZ2 and XZ2 Compact were released in the United States back in April. The Xperia XZ3 series is expected to come out soon, and as such, steeper discounts on the original models have started. Now you can get the XZ2 Compact for $499.99 at Amazon and Best Buy, or $470 at B&H. </p>

<p> Despite continuing losses in its mobile business sector, Sony still churns out phone after phone, much to the delight of its ardent fan base. It also maintains its existing lineup with new software updates and, just like many other manufacturers before it, the company has just shared when which of its devices will receive Android 10. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ2 Premium debuted with an MSRP of $1,000. Predictably, that hasn't worked out well for Sony. Luckily, as any phone tends to do after some time, the price has dropped to a much more palatable $649.99, which is $350 less than the launch price and $250 under current MSRP, from Amazon, B&H, and Focus Camera. </p>
<p> Netflix HDR support kicked off with the LG G6 back in May 2017, but quite a few devices have been added since then. Most recently, the Sony Xperia XZ2, the Huawei Mate 10, and the Huawei P20 were added. Three more phones have just joined the roster: the LG G7 One, the Sony Xperia XZ3, and the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium. </p>
<p> Every week, I examine somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred app updates while looking for changes. The most interesting things turn into APK Teardowns or Download posts. Many of the remaining updates are unremarkable, amounting to a few bug fixes, routine updates to libraries, or even just pixel-level adjustments to layouts and images. However, there are usually a few updates that land somewhere in between. I don't want to spam readers with dozens of short posts, but I hate to ignore things that people might want to know about, so I'm going to wrap up the leftovers for a little weekend reading and call it Update Notes. </p>
<p> There was a time not that many years ago when Sony was trusted implicitly by consumers all over the world. You knew if you bought a Sony product, you were getting the best, and people were willing to pay more for that peace of mind. However, Sony has struggled to find its place in today's hyper-competitive world, particularly when it comes to smartphones. Sony makes phones that are good in some ways, but the issues often outweigh the strengths. Through it all, the price is still consistently higher than competing devices. </p>
<p> Sony's newest flagship device, the Xperia XZ2 Premium, was announced back in February. It has all the features you'd expect from a high-end 2018 smartphone, like a Snapdragon 845 processor, 6GB RAM, 64GB of storage (with microSD expansion), IP65/68 water resistance, and more. The updated design, with curved glass and a rear fingerprint sensor, was highly anticipated. </p>
<p> The 4K display-equipped Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium was announced back in April, but it's taken over two months for US availability info to surface. We'd expected it to be expensive, but Sony is asking as near as makes no difference $1,000 for this thing. Unless you really want that ultra high-res display, this is going to be a hard sell. </p>
<p> Just a few weeks after launching its Android P testing program for Xperia XZ2 devices, Sony has made the second beta available to download. It's available over-the-air for those already running Android P Beta 1, and it comes with a whole bunch of big fixes. </p>
<p> Sony has officially announced the Xperia XZ2 Premium, the top dog in the XZ2 range. Last year's XZ Premium was best known for its 4K display, and the XZ2 Premium builds upon that by offering HDR certification, top-notch processing power, a "Motion Eye Dual" camera setup, Qi wireless charging, and more. </p>

<p> Xperia XZs </p>
<p> People clearly like slow-motion videos, given The Slow Mo Guys' 9.8 million subscribers on YouTube. If you're planning on shooting some seriously slowed-down videos, you don't have many options, and most of them are prohibitively expensive. However, some of Sony's latest phones can shoot 960fps video, with the Xperia XZs being one of them. Now you can pick one up for $399.99 on Amazon, $200 less than its list price. </p>
<p> Sony's phones don't have a working fingerprint sensor in the US, have confusing names, and are almost always expensive. But software updates is where Sony really shines, and now the company is updating two more phones to Oreo. </p>
<p> Sony Xperia phones aren't particularly popular here in the US, but perhaps a price drop on one of its latest phones, the XZs, may change that just a little bit. Multiple retailers are currently offering this 960fps slow motion-capable device for $499.99, a full $100 off its MSRP. </p>
<p> In light of today's big phone announcement, you'd be forgiven for lamenting the fact that phones continue to climb higher and higher in price. Speaking of over-priced devices, you can get yourself an unlocked Sony Xperia XZs with a U.S. warranty for $546.50, meaning that you'll save $153.49 off of the total MSRP. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZs was announced in February, alongside the XZ Premium. It's a slightly-upgraded model of the 2016 Xperia XZ, with Sony's 'Motion Eye' camera sensor capable of recording 960fps slow-motion video. The phone initially sold for a whopping $699 in the United States, but it has fallen in price a few times since, and now you can get it for $579 on Amazon. </p>
<p> Sony has added yet another handset to its Open Device Program. This time it's the Xperia XZs. With older brothers, the Xperia XZ and the X Performance, already on the list, it was only a matter of time before the newer flagship made its way to the program. Sony's support for the open source community is commendable, and this is more great news for developers hoping to play with custom builds of Nougat on their Xperia devices. </p>
<p> Back in February, Sony announced a minor refresh of 2016's Xperia XZ, called the Xperia XZs. It showed up for sale on Amazon earlier this month for a whopping $700, but now the price has gone down a bit. Now you can buy it for $40.59 off the introductory price. </p>
<p> Did you like the Xperia XZ, but find it a crippling flaw that it couldn't shoot video in super slow-motion? Well, you're in luck, as the Xperia XZs is now available for purchase. It's capable of shooting a whopping 960fps with its new Exmor RS sensor. In the US, Amazon will sell you one of these bad boys for $699. </p>
<p> I don't know how Sony hasn't run out of alphabet letters and rectangular designs by now. Year after year, or more like half year after half year, the company churns another phone that distinctly looks like almost every Sony phone we've seen to date (which might be a good or a bad thing, depending on how much you like the design language) and that has another letter or noun added in the name. I'm honestly confused, but I understand that it has its appeal for a small subset of people, so I'll put my judgment aside and carry on telling you about these new Sony phones announced at MWC today. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/xperia-z/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549147" filename="xperia-z">
<p> One of the best parts of LineageOS (and its predecessor, CyanogenMod) is that it can breathe life into older devices. Some phones and tablets can end up with several more years of Android updates thanks to the ROM community. Since we last looked at LineageOS, a whopping 10 more devices have been added, most of which are a few years old at this point. </p>
<p> The lads and lasses on the open source CyanogenMod Team continue to bring their Android nightly ROMs to phones and tablets that have long been abandoned by uncaring manufacturers. This week a handful of new devices get builds for CM13, based on code from Android 6.0. All of them are nightlies (so possibly not ready for primetime), but I'll bet their respective users are happy to get the attention anyway. Here they are: </p>
<p> Pour one out for the Xperia Z series. It's served Sony well since 2013, going through a relatively rapid five generations in under three years, plus offshoots like the massive Xperia Z Ultra, the diminutive Xperia Z Compact and its well-regarded descendants, and even a tablet or two. But all things must pass away, and so it is with the Z moniker. Probably. There won't be an Xperia Z6 at any rate, at least according to the statement that the company gave to XperiaBlog. </p>
<p> #Android 5.1, Lollipop rolling out for original #Xperia Z Series & T2 Ultra - please check locally & watch for notifications </p>
<p> According to Sony's official PR team, the Android 5.1 OTA will start going out to the original Xperia Z series and the T2 Ultra. </p>
<p> Some of Sony's older hardware (well, relatively speaking, anyway) is getting updated to Lollipop today. If you own an Xperia Z (LTE model), Xperia ZR (LTE model), Xperia ZL, or Xperia Tablet Z, all released in 2013, check your status bar for an over-the-air update. According to Xperia Blog and the always-reliable XDA, all four of these devices are being upgraded as of now. As usual, it may take a few days or even a week or two for the rollout to reach you. </p>
<p> The various models range from prolific to somewhat niche, but it seems like the updates are going out to most or all countries simultaneously. </p>
<p> Sony's relationship with "pure" Android is an interesting one. As a company they generally make it easy to root or otherwise modify their phones or tablets, with a few notable qualifiers. The AOSP for Xperia project, which provides the basic tools for building standard Android ROMs on popular devices, is also one way that Sony stays relevant for those who buy phones with the intent to add aftermarket software. Today it gets two new flagship options, the older Xperia Z1 and Z2. </p>
<p> You can find the binaries for both new phones on the SonyXperiaDev GitHub. They're classified by codename: "Honami" is the Xperia Z1 while "Sirius" is the Z2. </p>
<p> Sony has announced that the latest version of KitKat is now rolling out to many of its Xperia products with Z in their name. That includes the Z, the ZL, the ZR, and the Tablet Z. For the confused, no, I'm not talking about smearing chocolate all over a Wii U controller. Sony just really likes the final letter of the alphabet, and it's now delivering Android 4.4.4 to four devices all bearing Z in their names. The software version is number 10.5.1.A.0.283. </p>
<p> just in: #android 4.4.4 rolls for #Xperia Z, ZL, ZR & Tablet Z – brings fixes, battery, wifi & email improvements and more #SonyXperia </p>
<p> When the company rolled out Android 4.4.2 to this same set of devices four months ago, more than a few users were left regretting the upgrade. </p>
<p> Update: Xperia Blog has confirmed this update is, in fact, Android 4.3. I can confirm that T-Mobile does, in fact, suck at changelogs. The version has also been tweaked to 10.4.C.0.814. </p>
<p> It might not be the latest and greatest anymore, but the Sony Xperia Z on T-Mobile is still getting some update love today. That mysterious Android 4.3 update that was pulled a few months back still isn't back, apparently. Instead, you get some small tweaks. </p>
<p> When you gather all these devices together for an update, there's no doubt Sony really loves the letter Z. Apparently it also loves KitKat, because all these devices are about to get their Android 4.4. KitKat updates. It's more than a number in this case – Sony has made some substantial tweaks. </p>
<p> Update: It looks like T-Mobile got cold feet. The support page has been reverted to its previous state, showing only the Android 4.2 update from November. Sorry, folks. </p>
<p> Do you use a Sony Xperia Z? Did you buy it from T-Mobile? Then check that Settings menu - according to this T-Mo support page, you're getting a taste of Jelly Bean 4.3 starting today. Of course these things tend to go out in waves, so those without patience can follow the links on T-Mobile's site and manually download and flash the new software (10.4.C.0.797) using the Sony PC Companion software. </p>
<p> The last time T-Mobile's carrier-customized version of the Z got an update was way back in November, when it was upgraded to Android 4.2. </p>

<p> When Sony debuted the Live on YouTube app last month, we wondered if compatibility would extend backwards to some other high-end Sony phones. The time is now, Sony smartphone owners... at least if you own one of three very specific models. Last year's flagship the Xperia Z1, its slightly smaller brother the Xperia Z1 Compact, and the high-powered Xperia ZL2 (which is only available in some Asian markets at the moment), all have access to the app as of now. </p>
<p> Outside of Google, it looks like Sony is the first company to start pushing 4.4.4 to its devices, beginning with the Z1, Z1 Compact, and Z Ultra. While it's only a very minor update, it still says something about Sony's drive to push timely updates that it's the first to get 4.4.4 out the door to consumer devices. </p>
<p> Included in this software </p>
<p> There are many improvements in this upgrade for your Xperia™ smartphone, some examples are: </p>
<p> Android 4.4.4 including the latest enhancements and security updates from Google </p>
<p> Updated and improved camera experience </p>
<p> Improvements when using Google voice, Contacts, Music streaming and Google+ </p>
<p> The latest versions of our Sony apps for you to enjoy </p>
<p> All of our latest bug fixes, optimisations & improvements </p>
<p> The update is currently only rolling out in Europe, but it will likely follow in other regions fairly soon. </p>
<p> Sony has been doing an admirable job keeping its Android hardware on the latest releases, and today they're bringing KitKat to three of the newest phones in their lineup. The flagship Xperia Z1, the slightly smaller Xperia Z1 Compact, and the super-sized Xperia Z Ultra all get an Android 4.4 upgrade starting now, according to this Sony Mobile blog post. </p>
<p> We haven't actually seen any updated devices from tipsters, and Sony makes the usual disclaimer that the rollout may vary by location and carrier. </p>
<p> Sony's new new smaller-than-average smartphone is getting a bit more appealing for the DIY crowd with official support for CynaogenMod, courtesy of the FXP dev group. Nightly builds for this device are now listed in the CM download portal. </p>
<p> Sony has a solid track record when it comes to quickly making open source kernel files available to the public. The company released them for the T-Mobile exclusive Xperia Z1s last week on the same day that the handset launched in stores. Now Sony is following through with the Xperia Z1 Compact just after launching the phone in Europe. </p>
<p> These files are what developers need to make the custom ROMs many of us can't get enough of. </p>
<p> Sony has two new phones to announce here at CES in Las Vegas: one specifically for the purple people over at T-Mobile, and one meant to appease users who want a premium phone without the bulk. The Xperia Z1s is T-Mobile's branded variant of the slightly older Xperia Z1. Aside from the extra letter and doubled storage, it's identical to Sony's international flagship. The Xperia Z1 Compact is a smaller 4.3" phone that keeps most of the premium features. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/xperia-z1s/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549951" filename="xperia-z1s">
<p> T-Mobile has posted the changelog for an over-the-air update now rolling out to Xperia Z1s owners. The primary new feature is the inclusion of in-flight texting support. This way users can communicate with folks on the ground for free via Gogo thanks to a partnership T-Mobile debuted a couple months back. </p>
<p> This isn't all the OTA has to offer. The update will provide the Xperia Z1s with Wi-Fi calling enhancements, which are always a nice thing to see considering the carrier's reliance on Wi-Fi networks to complement its cellular network. </p>
<p> Sony tends not to push its flagship phones on US carriers, for whatever reason. Sometimes a tweaked version will happen along at a later date, and that was the case with the Xperia Z1. T-Mobile got the Xperia Z1s in January of this year, but it was still on Android 4.3. Well, not anymore—KitKat is rolling out now. </p>
<p> Fitbit's Android app is useless without a matching fitness device to pair it with, but buying one without having a phone that supports it means having to rely on your computer for synching. That's less than desirable, so it's a good thing that the company is steadily working to expand the number of Android phones its products will support. Following the latest update to the Fitbit app, Moto G owners can now sync their handset up to a Fitbit accessory. </p>
<p> The new Xperia Z1s on T-Mobile is almost identical to the international Z1, except for the radio bands and some software tweaks. One thing that definitely isn't the same is the bootloader – it appears that T-Mobile has requested Sony not allow bootloader unlocks on this device. For a company trying to upend the traditional carrier model, this is awfully old-fashioned carrier behavior. </p>
<p> The Xperia Z1S was only announced last week at CES, but it's showing up for purchase right on time. As promised, the Xperia Z1S is on sale through T-Mobile's website for $528 full price or 24 equal payments of $22. </p>
<p> Sony has two new phones to announce here at CES in Las Vegas: one specifically for the purple people over at T-Mobile, and one meant to appease users who want a premium phone without the bulk. The Xperia Z1s is T-Mobile's branded variant of the slightly older Xperia Z1. Aside from the extra letter and doubled storage, it's identical to Sony's international flagship. The Xperia Z1 Compact is a smaller 4.3" phone that keeps most of the premium features. </p>
<p> Update: It looks like some signals got crossed. This is the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact - the "Z1s" is a T-Mobile branded variant of the original 5-inch phone. </p>
<p> It's been said that those who want a powerful modern smartphone with a non-gigantic screen don't have a lot of options. If a new post from the tireless Evleaks is to be believed, they'll have at least one more on T-Mobile very soon. </p>

<p> Sony was one of the first OEMs to focus on designing water-resistant phones, but they weren't always resistant enough. Consumers were brushed off by Sony when their water-resistant phones and tablets showed evidence of water damage. Now, there's a class action lawsuit wrapping up that could result in affected Sony owners getting a 50% refund on their devices. </p>
<p> After updating more recent flagship devices to Marshmallow in March, Sony commenced its Marshmallow rollout for other phones and tablets in its range earlier this month, including the Xperia Z2, the Z3, and the Z3 Compact. Now the Japanese consumer electronics company is updating more of the Xperia line to Marshmallow, including the Z2 Tablet, the Xperia Z3 Dual, and other Z2/Z3 variants from around the world. </p>
<p> According to Xperiablog, the only devices which got the update earlier in April were those in the Beta Marshmallow (also known as the Concept builds) program. Naturally, it makes sense those were updated first, and then other similar devices follow suit. </p>
<p> I'm not going to mince words here: if you don't have a Nexus phone, odds are pretty good that you aren't running Android 6.0. The best that you can say of most manufacturers when it comes to this software cycle is that maybe they're kinda-sorta trying to update last year's flagship phones. Sony has been a little better than most in that regard - they've already updated several phones and tablets from the Z4 and Z5 series, and now even older models are getting in on the action. According to XperiaBlog, the Xperia Z2, Xperia Z3, and Xperia Z3 Compact are being updated to Android 6.0 starting today. </p>
<p> Sony is ready to take its Android phones to the next Lollipop level. The company is sticking to its previous word that the Z series devices will start getting Android 5.1 in July and is starting the roll-out today with the Z3 and Z2 series. So consider yourself lucky if you have an Xperia Z3, Z3 Compact, Z3 Tablet Compact, Z2, or Z2 Tablet, because you're among the first Sony owners to get Android 5.1... well, if we don't count the GPE Z Ultra. </p>
<p> You'll obviously get all the benefits of Android 5.1, like better volume control and plenty of design and usability tweaks, but Sony has also added a few improvements to its own software. </p>
<p> Xperia owners, watch out. Lollipops are raining from the sky and smashing straight into your screens. If you welcome this phenomenon, don't do anything. These lollipops have heat-seeking sensors and will find your devices wherever they lay. If you prefer KitKat, you can swat the intruders away, but you'll never get to experience the future changes in store for your Android device. </p>
<p> Sony has confirmed that it is launching lollipops at Xperia Z3, Z3 Compact, and Z3 Tablet Compact devices all over the world (some of these updates were previously pushed out to smaller, test markets). The manufacturer plans to open fire on the Z2 and Z2 Tablet starting next week. </p>
<p> Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact, Z2, and Z2 Tablet owners around the world may soon have a reason to smile. According to XperiaBlog, Sony has started to roll out Android 5.0 to these three devices in various regions. This news comes shortly after the Japanese manufacturer started pushing out Lollipop to the Xperia Z3 and Z3 Compact yesterday. </p>
<p> This information has been confirmed. Sony Mobile updated its blog posting from yesterday to add all three devices to the list and announce that updates will start with the Nordics and Baltics. </p>
<p> Sony is making it easier to get AOSP ROMs up and running on its flagship devices with a few goodies for developers. After showing off stock Android 5.0 running on the Xperia Z3 recently, the company has posted source code and binaries for the Xperia Z3, Xperia Z3 Compact, Xperia Z2, Xperia Z1 and Xperia Z1 Compact. </p>
<p> Sony is releasing flagship smartphones at a furious pace. Barely six months after the Xperia Z2 was announced, the Z3 is already here. If you don't need to have the absolute latest and greatest, there's a good deal on the Z2 today. Just $399.99 gets you a new unlocked device compatible with US LTE bands. </p>
<p> Sony's back to its AOSP tricks, working to release some functional (if not exactly ideal) versions of the latest release of Android based on open-source code. This time they've quickly put together Android Open Source Project builds for the flagships of the last two years: the Xperia Z1, Z2, and Z3. You can see the bone-stock builds running in the video below. </p>
<p> As always with Sony's developer promotions, these builds aren't intended for end users - they aren't provided with any kind of promise for reliability or functionality. They don't even include the Play Store or other standard apps, which many people (erroneously) think of as part of "stock" Android. </p>
<p> Sony is very serious about giving PlayStation 4 owners the ability to play their console without actually playing with their consoles, so the company is expanding its remote play functionality to more devices. The required app hit the Play Store just last week, but it only worked for the Z3 line of devices. Now that's gradually changing. </p>
<p> Following the latest over-the-air update, the Xperia Z2 and Z2 Tablet will be able to share in the experience. So if you don't own a PlayStation Vita or a PlayStation TV but do happen to carry around one of Sony's slightly older flagship devices, you won't be left out much longer. </p>

<p> Xperia owners, watch out. Lollipops are raining from the sky and smashing straight into your screens. If you welcome this phenomenon, don't do anything. These lollipops have heat-seeking sensors and will find your devices wherever they lay. If you prefer KitKat, you can swat the intruders away, but you'll never get to experience the future changes in store for your Android device. </p>
<p> Sony has confirmed that it is launching lollipops at Xperia Z3, Z3 Compact, and Z3 Tablet Compact devices all over the world (some of these updates were previously pushed out to smaller, test markets). </p>
<p> Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact, Z2, and Z2 Tablet owners around the world may soon have a reason to smile. According to XperiaBlog, Sony has started to roll out Android 5.0 to these three devices in various regions. This news comes shortly after the Japanese manufacturer started pushing out Lollipop to the Xperia Z3 and Z3 Compact yesterday. </p>
<p> I don't know how many tablets Verizon typically sells, especially if you limit that to non-iPads. But however many of you picked up the admittedly neat Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet from Big Red, check your status bar for an update alert. Today's software update adds something even neater: the ability to remotely play games on your PlayStation 4 over your home Wi-Fi network. You'll need the official Remote Play app and a Dual Shock 4 controller to take advantage of it. </p>
<p> Sony is very serious about giving PlayStation 4 owners the ability to play their console without actually playing with their consoles, so the company is expanding its remote play functionality to more devices. The required app hit the Play Store just last week, but it only worked for the Z3 line of devices. Now that's gradually changing. </p>
<p> Following the latest over-the-air update, the Xperia Z2 and Z2 Tablet will be able to share in the experience. </p>
<p> Chromecast's screen casting feature works on a limited number of devices, but that list is gradually growing. For now, Sony appears to have cut to the front of the line of handsets waiting to get support. At the beginning of this month, the Chromecast gods smiled favorably upon the Xperia Z3 and the Z3 Compact. </p>
<p> Now at the end of the month, that attention is being poured upon the Xperia Z3v, Z2, and Z2 Tablet. </p>
<p> The Xperia Z2 Tablet isn't the most high-profile tablet around, but there are more than a few fans of Sony's unique industrial design. Combine that with the company's unlocked hardware (at least for non-carrier versions), and you've got a perfect candidate for custom ROMs. The CyanogenMod team has started publishing nightly releases for the Z2 Tablet, in both its Wi-Fi (castor) and unlocked GSM (castor_windy) flavors. The first nightly build is available for download now. </p>
<p> Tablets that aren't iPads don't sell well on US carriers, probably because no one is all that keen on paying an extra monthly fee in order to use them and/or sharing a limited amount of data. (3G and LTE tablets are much more popular overseas.) So there's really no point in pre-ordering a tablet from a carrier, unless you absolutely have to have it on day one. If that's the case for the Xperia Z2 Tablet, let your fingers do the walking over to Verizon's website. </p>
<p> We've seen a leaked shot of the Xperia Z2 bearing Verizon's markings, and now it's the Xperia Z2 Tablet's turn. @evleaks has shared an image depicting the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet with the carrier's branding centrally located square on its back. You know it's Verizon's because its logo is larger than the manufacturer's. </p>
<p> At 6.4mm, the Xperia Z2 Tablet is very thin, and at 425 grams, it's very light. The device comes with a 10-inch 1920 by 1080 display, a Snapdragon 801 processor, and 3GB of RAM. </p>
<p> Sony may not have the best track record when it comes to making its phones available across a wide number of carriers in the US, but it has no problem sharing its open source kernel files on a timely basis. The company officially announced the Xperia Z2 a month ago at Mobile World Congress, and now much of the handset's internal code is available for download on the web. </p>

<p> One of the best parts of LineageOS (and its predecessor, CyanogenMod) is that it can breathe life into older devices. Some phones and tablets can end up with several more years of Android updates thanks to the ROM community. Since we last looked at LineageOS, a whopping 10 more devices have been added, most of which are a few years old at this point. </p>
<p> The OTA has started rolling out to some Xperia Z5 and Xperia Z5 Premium users and will probably expand to the Z5 Compact soon. </p>
<p> Normally only Nexus and other first-party Google devices get a taste of an upcoming Android version before it's released, barring custom ROMs and other end user activities. But Sony has been offering experimental AOSP builds for some of its phones for some time, and today the company has surprised and delighted owners of the former flagship Xperia Z3 with a custom Android N developer preview. This is more or less the same as the preview builds for Nexus phones and tablets, and it includes the Play Store and Google Services - everything one needs for a full Android experience. </p>
<p> After updating more recent flagship devices to Marshmallow in March, Sony commenced its Marshmallow rollout for other phones and tablets in its range earlier this month, including the Xperia Z2, the Z3, and the Z3 Compact. Now the Japanese consumer electronics company is updating more of the Xperia line to Marshmallow, including the Z2 Tablet, the Xperia Z3 Dual, and other Z2/Z3 variants from around the world. </p>
<p> According to Xperiablog, the only devices which got the update earlier in April were those in the Beta Marshmallow (also known as the Concept builds) program. Naturally, it makes sense those were updated first, and then other similar devices follow suit. </p>
<p> I'm not going to mince words here: if you don't have a Nexus phone, odds are pretty good that you aren't running Android 6.0. The best that you can say of most manufacturers when it comes to this software cycle is that maybe they're kinda-sorta trying to update last year's flagship phones. Sony has been a little better than most in that regard - they've already updated several phones and tablets from the Z4 and Z5 series, and now even older models are getting in on the action. According to XperiaBlog, the Xperia Z2, Xperia Z3, and Xperia Z3 Compact are being updated to Android 6.0 starting today. </p>
<p> Few would be surprised to hear that the Xperia Z5, Sony's latest flagship, would eventually get Android 6.0. The question is when that update will arrive. </p>
<p> Few Android OEMs take their updates as seriously and as extensively as Sony does, and Marshmallow is no exception. Ever since the source code for Android 6.0.0 was released by Google, the company revealed which devices in its portfolio will get it (hint: they go as far back as the Xperia Z2), released AOSP binaries for a slew of devices including its new Xperia Z5 and Z5 Compact, and announced concept Marshmallow builds for the Z3 and Z3 Compact that are open for 10,000 testers. Now these builds are starting to roll to users who signed up for them and you have more opportunities to try them out if you own a compatible smartphone. </p>
<p> Sony's non-presence in the US smartphone market only seems to be accelerating of late, with the company having closed all of its retail stores in the country (apart from the one on Madison Avenue in NYC), shut down its online shop (it redirects all listings to 3rd party retailers), and cancelled its only known upcoming device. This, alongside increasingly dismal sales performance for Xperia phones even outside America, tends to paint a not-nice picture of the company's smartphone division. </p>
<p> But Sony Pictures lives on, and with it, the blockbuster Daniel Craig Bond franchise. The upcoming 007 film Spectre will, of course, feature a lot of Sony product placement, including the generally well-liked Xperia Z5... </p>
<p> Sony is ahead of most other OEMs when it comes to its support of open source. It contributes significantly to AOSP and even releases binaries for many of its devices so developers can build AOSP ROMs for them. Today, Sony is announcing support for the first three 64-bit devices in the Open Device project. </p>
<p> Sony is ready to take its Android phones to the next Lollipop level. The company is sticking to its previous word that the Z series devices will start getting Android 5.1 in July and is starting the roll-out today with the Z3 and Z2 series. So consider yourself lucky if you have an Xperia Z3, Z3 Compact, Z3 Tablet Compact, Z2, or Z2 Tablet, because you're among the first Sony owners to get Android 5.1... well, if we don't count the GPE Z Ultra. </p>
<p> You'll obviously get all the benefits of Android 5.1, like better volume control and plenty of design and usability tweaks, but Sony has also added a few improvements to its own software. </p>

<p> Sony was one of the first OEMs to focus on designing water-resistant phones, but they weren't always resistant enough. Consumers were brushed off by Sony when their water-resistant phones and tablets showed evidence of water damage. Now, there's a class action lawsuit wrapping up that could result in affected Sony owners getting a 50% refund on their devices. </p>

<p> At this year's I/O, Google again made a developer preview of the upcoming version of Android available for download. Thing is, it only ran on Nexus phones and tablets. Today Sony has announced plans to release a test build of Android M for Xperia products in the Sony Open Device program as well. Here we see it running on an Xperia Z3 Compact. </p>
<p> There are a few things to keep in mind before you rush to the source page below. A wordpress error appears for links to the "easy-to-follow guide" and the "necessary software binaries" that you need to create a test image and flash it to your own device. </p>
<p> Xperia owners, watch out. Lollipops are raining from the sky and smashing straight into your screens. If you welcome this phenomenon, don't do anything. These lollipops have heat-seeking sensors and will find your devices wherever they lay. If you prefer KitKat, you can swat the intruders away, but you'll never get to experience the future changes in store for your Android device. </p>
<p> Sony has confirmed that it is launching lollipops at Xperia Z3, Z3 Compact, and Z3 Tablet Compact devices all over the world (some of these updates were previously pushed out to smaller, test markets). The manufacturer plans to open fire on the Z2 and Z2 Tablet starting next week. </p>
<p> Sony promised it would bring Android 5.0 to all its Z series phones, and now it's starting to live up to that. The newest generation Xperia Z3 and Z3 Compact are first up. The OTA is rolling out now to devices in Nordic and Baltic countries, but other markets should follow within two weeks. There's a nifty demo video to go along with the announcement. </p>
<p> CyanogenMod supports a few new devices today, all of them Sony. Just head over to the CM download section and you can get nightly builds for the Xperia Z3, Z3 Compact, and Z3 Tablet Compact with LTE (that's Scorpion). This follows the WiFi version of this tablet getting support just a few days ago. </p>
<p> Sony began pushing out an update to the Xperia Z3 on December 11th, but we didn't know exactly what it contained. Well, we do now. Sony has graciously added a changelog to the page. The Z3 and Z3 compact are getting the same features, but it's a nice little update. </p>
<p> If you live in a real-life version of the latest James Bond or Spider-man flicks, where absolutely every piece of electronics everywhere is made by Sony, then we've got good news: the PS4 Remote Play app is now available for download. This lets the Xperia Z3, Z3 Compact, and Z3 Tablet Compact use a PlayStation 4 controller and super-fast streaming video to play PlayStation 4 games over a home Wi-Fi network. That should make up for all the crazy supervillains swarming around your house. </p>
<p> Pardon me, ma'am, but you'd probably have more fun playing a racing game than watching The Amazing Spider-Man 2. </p>

<p> Tucked into the flurry of news around Sony's trio of new Xperia Z3 devices was the fact that they'll be the first non-gaming gadgets to use the company's proprietary PlayStation 4 Remote Play system. The flagship Xperia Z3, high-powered "mini" Xperia Z3 Compact, and the 8-inch Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact will be able to stream PS4 games and play them across a home Wi-Fi network later this year. The PS4 can already stream gameplay to the PlayStation Vita. </p>
<p> Here at IFA 2014 in Berlin, Sony is announcing new entries to its Xperia smartphone line at all levels. The flagship Z series, last updated only six months ago at Mobile World Congress, has been bolstered with the Xperia Z3. This device is the tip top of Sony's line, though in terms of sheer hardware it's an evolution rather than a revolution. The 5.2-inch 1080p screen, Snapdragon 801 processor (bumped up to 2.5Ghz), and 20.7MP rear camera are similar to the last iteration, but the body is much thinner at 7.3mm. </p>

<p> Sony has updated the product page for its Xperia Z4 Tablet in the UK, and it's not the good kind of update. The date listed for the product to start shipping has been changed from today to June 17th. Nice last minute switcheroo there, Sony. </p>
<p> Sony's mobile division may be spiraling into oblivion, but that isn't stopping the company from dropping new hardware at Mobile World Congress. First up is the really hot Xperia Z4 Tablet, a very light and thin 10.1" tablet. </p>
<p> Anyone eager to see what Sony has planned for the Xperia Z4 Tablet won't have much longer to wait. According to XperiaBlog, Sony has let slip its plans to show off the tablet on March 3rd. That date lines up with a certain Mobile World Congress taking place at the time where a bunch of other manufacturers will also be showing off their upcoming products. </p>
<p> Sony reportedly let the information slip into the official Xperia Lounge app, which XperiaBlog has shown off in a screenshot. </p>
<p> The company has already pulled the information, but it's too late to keep the date under wraps. </p>

<p> xperia z4v </p>
<p> Remember the Verizon Z4v? Me neither [almost]! I even wrote an article about this phone like 2 weeks ago and I still barely remember it. If you want a refresher: the Z4v was basically a Verizon-ified version of the Xperia Z4. Which launched way back in April. There's also that whole "the Z5 now exists" thing, which makes releasing a new Z4 variant kind of pointless and generally a bit silly. </p>
<p> Verizon, in what can only be called a mildly astonishing moment of self-realization and pragmatism, has therefore decided to cancel the phone. Take it away, Albert: </p>
<p> Verizon will no longer be launching Xperia Z4v, however we are committed to supporting Sony Mobile’s product portfolio and will support existing products. </p>
<p> Remember that time Verizon announced it will carry a version of the Xperia Z4 called the Xperia Z4v three months ago? And said it would be out "this summer?" Well, summer ends in exactly... tomorrow, and the phone still isn't out. It was actually allegedly supposed to be released over a month ago, but now any kind of launch before October seems highly unlikely. Some guy got one anyway (somehow) and reviewed it in this video on YouTube. Verizon's site, by the way, says the phone is still "coming soon." </p>
<p> As I hope we can all agree, this is tremendously, mind-bendingly dumb for several reasons. </p>
<p> Okay, Sony. Can you just decide what you want to call this phone? Is it the Z4 like in Japan, or the Z3+ as in most other markets? I say this because the phone is coming to the US as the Xperia Z4v on Verizon. It will be out this summer with obnoxious Verizon branding and yes, a Snapdragon 810. It's not clear if Verizon will be posting warnings in its stores. </p>

<p> The last time we covered LineageOS, the project had started supporting seven new phones, including the Xperia Z5 Compact and LG K10. Since then, several additional devices have been added to the official build roster. These include the Sony Xperia Z5, Samsung Galaxy S6, and Redmi 3S/3X. </p>
<p> Sony was one of the first OEMs to focus on designing water-resistant phones, but they weren't always resistant enough. Consumers were brushed off by Sony when their water-resistant phones and tablets showed evidence of water damage. Now, there's a class action lawsuit wrapping up that could result in affected Sony owners getting a 50% refund on their devices. </p>
<p> When it comes to software updates, Sony is on the job. The company is always one of the first to release updates for its recent flagship devices and is great at updating even relatively older-generation devices quickly too. Take the Xperia Z3 Plus, Z4 Tablet, and Z5 family which were announced sometime between May 2015 and September 2015, making them nearly 2 years old. They got the update to Android Nougat 7.0 back in February and they're now following the footsteps of the XZ and X Performance and getting upped to the more recent Android 7.1.1. </p>
<p> The update bumps the build number from 32.3.A.2.33 </p>
<p> The OTA has started rolling out to some Xperia Z5 and Xperia Z5 Premium users and will probably expand to the Z5 Compact soon. </p>
<p> Sony is sometimes a little slow to release new devices everywhere, but at least its Android update schedule is on par with other OEMs. That is to say, it's annoyingly slow, but not unusually so. The Z5, Z4 Tablet, and Z3+ are all getting Android 6.0 right now, but as usual, it's a staged rollout that will vary by country. </p>
<p> Few would be surprised to hear that the Xperia Z5, Sony's latest flagship, would eventually get Android 6.0. The question is when that update will arrive. </p>
<p> After taking its sweet time releasing the Xperia Z5 and Z5 Compact in the US, Sony thought charging $600 and $500 respectively for the devices seemed like a good idea. Well, they're already discounted via Amazon for $50-60 off after going on sale February 7th. </p>
<p> While they don't carry the same popularity as flagships from Samsung, HTC, and LG, Sony still has some dedicated fans of its unique hardware. Those fans will be glad to know that the Xperia Z5 and its smaller cousin the Xperia Z5 Compact are now on sale in the United States, right on time. According to Sony's blog post, both phones should now be available at Amazon, Best Buy, B&H Photo, and other electronics retailers. They're both being sold as unlocked GSM phones. At the time of writing Amazon only has the international version (without a US warranty) and Best Buy's website is only showing the Z5 Compact, but B&H seems to have all of the current US models. </p>
<p> Sony made some tweaks to its design aesthetic this year to accommodate the inclusion of a fingerprint sensor in the power button of the Z5. It's not as accurate as I'd like, but it's still nice to have. However, a number of reports claim that Sony will not include this feature in the newly announced US variants of the phone. We reached out to Sony and got confirmation: no fingerprint reader for the US. </p>
<p> Sony unveiled the Xperia Z5 series way back in September 2015, and they're finally coming to the US. The Z5 and Z5 Compact will go on sale February 7th at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H. The Z5 will be $599 and the Z5 Compact will run you $499. </p>

<p> I remember not that long ago thinking that a 4.7-inch phone screen was pretty large. How could they get bigger than that and still be usable? Surely this is the end of the road... and here we are a few years later and the Xperia Z5 Compact is considered diminutive at 4.6-inches. When I say this phone is small (and it is) I mean it's small compared to every other Android flagship. </p>
<p> Consumers have voted with their dollars and told OEMs they want big phones, leaving the Xperia Compact series as your last bastion of tiny flagship phones. When a device basically owns a niche, it doesn't have to be amazing, it just needs to be. </p>
<p> The Xperia Z5 and its variants are great looking devices, but for those of us in the US, they're just that—great looking. Sony hasn't started shipping them our way, no matter how far open we stretch our wallets. </p>
<p> Sony's open device project was launched to allow developers to run AOSP Android builds on many of Sony's devices. The company has been keeping up the software support for this program, and has even added new devices frequently. Now, Sony's latest flagships are joining the open initiative. You can grab the Marshmallow software binaries for the Xperia Z5 and Z5 Compact right now. </p>

Since we last looked at LineageOS, a whopping 10 more devices have been added, most of which are a few years old at this point. </p>
<p> The lads and lasses on the open source CyanogenMod Team continue to bring their Android nightly ROMs to phones and tablets that have long been abandoned by uncaring manufacturers. This week a handful of new devices get builds for CM13, based on code from Android 6.0. All of them are nightlies (so possibly not ready for primetime), but I'll bet their respective users are happy to get the attention anyway. Here they are: </p>
<p> Some of Sony's older hardware (well, relatively speaking, anyway) is getting updated to Lollipop today. If you own an Xperia Z (LTE model), Xperia ZR (LTE model), Xperia ZL, or Xperia Tablet Z, all released in 2013, check your status bar for an over-the-air update. According to Xperia Blog and the always-reliable XDA, all four of these devices are being upgraded as of now. As usual, it may take a few days or even a week or two for the rollout to reach you. </p>
<p> The various models range from prolific to somewhat niche, but it seems like the updates are going out to most or all countries simultaneously. </p>
<p> Sony has announced that the latest version of KitKat is now rolling out to many of its Xperia products with Z in their name. That includes the Z, the ZL, the ZR, and the Tablet Z. For the confused, no, I'm not talking about smearing chocolate all over a Wii U controller. Sony just really likes the final letter of the alphabet, and it's now delivering Android 4.4.4 to four devices all bearing Z in their names. The software version is number 10.5.1.A.0.283. </p>
<p> just in: #android 4.4.4 rolls for #Xperia Z, ZL, ZR & Tablet Z – brings fixes, battery, wifi & email improvements and more #SonyXperia </p>
<p> When the company rolled out Android 4.4.2 to this same set of devices four months ago, more than a few users were left regretting the upgrade. </p>
<p> When you gather all these devices together for an update, there's no doubt Sony really loves the letter Z. Apparently it also loves KitKat, because all these devices are about to get their Android 4.4. KitKat updates. It's more than a number in this case – Sony has made some substantial tweaks. </p>
<p> Fitbit's Android app is useless without a matching fitness device to pair it with, but buying one without having a phone that supports it means having to rely on your computer for synching. That's less than desirable, so it's a good thing that the company is steadily working to expand the number of Android phones its products will support. Following the latest update to the Fitbit app, Moto G owners can now sync their handset up to a Fitbit accessory. They are joined by anyone who owns an Xperia Z, Z1, Z1S, ZL, ZR, Z Ultra, or Tablet Z. </p>
<p> The update also tackles a few crash reports and brings in some bug fixes aimed at Korean users. </p>
<p> While the Nexus elite have since moved on to KitKat, there are still a lot of devices just getting by with some flavor of Jelly Bean. At least Sony is keeping its promise of updating devices to the latest version of that sweet-themed platform. Android 4.3 is beginning to make its way to the Xperia Z, Xperia ZL, Xperia ZR, And Xperia Tablet Z. </p>
<p> It's been less than 24 hours since Google announced Jelly Bean 4.3 and published the new code to the Android Open Source Project, and Sony is already talking up their plans for phone updates. That's what I call customer service! In a short blog post, Sony confirmed a 4.3 update for six of their latest phones and (one) tablets: </p>
<p> This isn't necessarily an exhaustive list, and no timeframe has been announced. Other devices may get updated - and given Sony's decent record with Android updates, I would expect more phones to be announced soon - but these six already have their tickets punched. </p>
<p> The Xperia Z is a pretty spiffy flagship phone, and tough as well, thanks to its IP55/IP57 Ingress Protection rating. But now there's a more specialized model coming, the Xperia ZR, designed specifically for waterproof functioning in even wetter environments. The new phone is manufactured to the higher IP55/IP58 standard, meaning that it can be safely submersed in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. </p>
<p> The Xperia ZR roughly follows the Z's design, getting rid of some of the slim lines and premium materials for the sake of its more waterproof chassis. It looks a lot like the slightly down-market ZL, in fact, with a 10.4mm-thick plastic body. </p>

<p> x phone </p>
<p> The leakiest and one of the most mysterious phones in recent history just got a little less mysterious as @evleaks dropped the first official press renders onto our sleepy heads late Friday night. The OS is close to stock (it's Android 4.2.2 for now, but we fully expect 4.3 soon after its release), the cameras are where they're supposed to be, the on-screen buttons make us happy, and overall, it's not such a bad-looker for a mid-spec, affordable device. </p>
<p> Google+ user Дима Прокопенко has just given us a tantalizing, more complete look at the Moto X, posting a Rogers "Tech Experts" demo video that shows off some of the hotly-anticipated device's unique features. </p>
<p> Before we get to features, it's worth noting that the video indicates a Rogers launch "in August," as an exclusive for the Canadian carrier. </p>
<p> The video also shows off the Moto X's always-on voice commands, allowing users to query Google Search with their voice regardless of whether they're in the search app. </p>
<p> The conferences put on by AllThingsD tend to be a bit sedate - Walt Mossberg gets on stage with some Very Important People and picks their brain in front of a live audience. Not so with tonight's interview of Motorola CEO Dennis Woodside and Research & Development head Regina Dugan. At the D11 stage, Woodside let loose with a flurry of information about the company's plans for the remainder of the year, starting with the much-rumored X Phone. </p>
<p> Intrepid leakster @evleaks has just dropped a few images of a black-boxed Motorola device that appears to be headed for AT&T. It's worth noting that this is the first Motorola product we've seen badged up for an American carrier since the RAZR HD / RAZR M last summer, quite a long time ago. </p>
<p> It's also a phone we've seen before. At least, it seems to be. Vietnamese blog Tinhte leaked a device with the codename "XT912A" (XT is Moto's typical device prefix for "DROID" branded devices), and it's pretty clear the two are one in the same in most respects, at least based on what we see in these photos. </p>
<p> Let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we? The year was 2012, the Galaxy S III and the HTC One X were still new, and some jerk on the internet suggested that maybe it's cool if people started appreciating their amazing phones instead of complaining about how their device wasn't revolutionary. </p>
<p> In the time since then, certain segments of the tech community have opted to go in the other direction. </p>
<p> Ever since the WSJ dropped a hint about the mythical 'X Phone' back in December, the rumors have not stopped flowing. Which is great because, according to Motorola's CFO, the 18 months of product pipeline that Google acquired weren't exactly wow-ing anyone. However, according to Moto's design chief Jim Wicks, the next generation of hardware will be fantastic. </p>
<p> The handsets have been in the works for the last eight months (so since around August, for those counting), and will target the segments of the market that's looking for a "just right" screen size. </p>
<p> Hey, so, this is crazy, but Google bought a smartphone company (Motorola), and now they're working on a smartphone together. Shocker. Snarkiness aside, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that, according to its sources, Motorola and Google are working on making a flagship phone specifically to compete with the iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy line. It is internally known as the 'X Phone,' and will allegedly be released in 2013. </p>
<p> At this point, if Motorola and Google weren't working on a high-end phone for 2013, I'd be worried. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/xposed-framework/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17554617" filename="xposed-framework">
<p> Most of our rooting and ROMing readers should be familiar with the name GravityBox, which is a set of tweaks that use the Xposed framework to modify AOSP-based ROMs with features and tweaks typically found in third-party projects—giving you ROM-like features while running stock, basically. Earlier today we were interested to see the tool had a listing on the Play Store, but after reaching out to GravityBox developer C3C076, we've learned it has no association with the project. </p>
<p> Xposed, a framework that allows users to install heavy modifications to Android, usually takes a few months to be updated for every new Android release. However, it took over a year for the creator of Xposed (Rovo89) to update the framework for Nougat, due to the major changes Android 7.0 made to the app runtime. </p>
<p> Xposed Framework was extremely popular in the KitKat and Lollipop days for heavy system modification, but until today, it lacked support for Android 7.0 Nougat. While the developer shared status updates every once in a while, progress was slow thanks to major changes in Nougat's app runtime. At long last, Xposed is finally available for Android 7.0 and 7.1 devices. </p>
<p> The Xposed Framework and its associated modules are the best friends of users who know their way around root-level tools, but don't want a full custom ROM (or can't find one for their less-popular devices). One downside is that Xposed is the passion project of a single developer, "rovo89." He (we have it on fairly good authority that it is he, though the dev is very private) works on the framework outside of his day job, and it's often several months before rovo89 has it working to a level that's ready for general users. </p>
<p> Bless you, Xposed Framework. Thou art the last refuge of power users whose hardware has been forsaken by manufacturer and ROM developer alike. The root-enabled tool has a new module that back-ports a bunch of Android Nougat features to earlier versions of the OS. It's called AndroidN-ify, and the latest update includes a tweak that exposes Google's fancy new voice-controlled Assistant search tool to users on Android 6.0. An earlier build.prop tweak allowed Android 7.0 users to try Assistant on non-Pixel phones, which won't be officially supported when the new hardware launches. </p>
<p> Following the launch of Xposed Framework for Android 6.0 last week, C3C076 has just announced a Marshmallow-compatible version of his popular all-in-one toolkit, GravityBox. As with previous releases, GravityBox is available as a separate app for Marshmallow, so older versions will continue to be accessible to users on JellyBean, KitKat, or Lollipop. </p>
<p> GravityBox's Xposed module contains one of the most comprehensive set of tweaks out there, including adjustments to the status bar, lockscreen, launcher, dialer, QuickSettings, navigation bar, and much more. The new version does not yet include any new features, but that shouldn't be an issue to any of its fans who were patiently waiting for Marshmallow compatibility. </p>
<p> Xposed Framework is a modification for root-level users that allows them to apply a wide series of mods and tweaks to a variety of Android releases and skins. It's become a popular alternative to full custom ROMs, especially for users who only want one or two tweaks to their devices instead of a full transformation. The creator of Xposed, who goes by "rovo89" on XDA-Developers, posted a new version for Android 6.0 Marshmallow this afternoon after a brief tease earlier this week. </p>
<p> The Xposed Framework is one of the most versatile tools available for tweakers and tinkerers in the Android community. Installing the framework on a rooted device unlocks a world of possibilities for changing the behavior of system and user apps without any modifications to the app files themselves. These sorts of tweaks used to only be accessible to users on custom ROMs, but the ease and flexibility provided by Xposed caused it to very quickly gain popularity among fans of pure vanilla Android as well. There are currently hundreds of installable modules, which allow for everything ranging from YouTube background playback, to enabling Force Touch on Android, to even making several devices water resistant. </p>
<p> Android 5.0 brought major changes to the platform, and that made it hard to get the Xposed system tweaking framework functional. The project's developer has finally announced that Xposed for Lollipop is ready after months of betas and unofficial builds. That doesn't mean it's completely without risks, but nothing should be obviously broken. </p>
<p> A discussion on Google+ started yesterday by Yahooer (and former Nexus device maintainer) JBQ about modified firmware and app bug/crash reports has started something of a debate: should developers actually heed crash and other logs from users with things such as modified frameworks, or even custom ROMs? </p>
<p> On the extreme end of the spectrum, the popular Xposed module allows you to heavily modify the behavior, appearance, and other aspects of the Android OS. It also unabashedly is a source of compatibility issues in some third-party apps, because it can change, add, or remove things that third-party apps simply aren't going to account for. </p>

<p> x-ray </p>
<p> Avid readers on Android have some exciting new toys to look forward to in the latest version of Amazon Kindle. Update 4.8 adds some significant features to an already-packed app, specifically linked to in-book search. "X-Ray" is a proprietary system that downloads a pre-configured, collated file that includes information about the book itself, the characters, the setting, and the context of basically everything. For complex fiction, non-fiction, or textbooks, it's an amazing system previously reserved for the Kindle e-readers and tablets. </p>
<p> Amazon has been busy working on software updates for its line of Kindle Fire devices, and the latest versions of the software for each device are now available to download. </p>
<p> For each device, the update provides enhancements for viewing textbooks, with the 2nd generation Fire and the Fire HD 7" getting "X-Ray for Textbooks". This feature allows users to access the most important terms and concepts, with glossary definitions and links to relevant pages within books. </p>
<p> Today has undoubtedly been a momentous one for Amazon. We've seen the introduction of a new family of Kindle products including the new Kindle Fire and a pair of Kindle Fire HD tablets. </p>
<p> Following today's announcements, Amazon decided to take some time to introduce a few awesome new features those who buy from the Kindle line can expect to enjoy from their new Amazon-branded tablets. In this post, we'll take a brief look at the bevy of new features, starting with X-Ray for Movies. </p>
<p> We've all read the horror stories: a new virus is crawling through the third-party stores, aiming to steal your personal information, identity, and first born child. More often than not, this type of malicious app is made possible because of one of the various root vulnerabilities that have been discovered throughout the various versions of Android. </p>
<p> X-Ray is a new app that lets you see exactly how vulnerable your device is by scanning it against several of these exploits, including RageAgainstTheCage, Gingerbreak, Mempodroid, Levitator, and a few more. </p>

<p> x-ray camera </p>
<p> There's been an outsize and protracted hubbub over the OnePlus 8 Pro's color filter camera. It let users see through some thin plastics and other materials, including certain types of cloth — leading to worries about it granting "X-ray vision." It was never particularly effective at seeing through clothing, but nevertheless, OnePlus is rolling out a patch to stem potential abuse by limiting the camera's functionality. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/18 10:05pm PDTon May 18, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/19 7:50am PDTon May 19, 2020. </p>
<p> OnePlus has announced that it will temporarily disable the "color filter" camera on the 8 Pro in a future update, but only the Chinese version of the phone running HydrogenOS will be affected. The camera, which is augmented with its ability to gather infrared light, was able to see through materials like certain plastics and even some kinds of cloth. The functionality will apparently return in the future when OnePlus can limit "other functionality that may be of concern." </p>

<p> Xtorm </p>
<p> Yesterday I reviewed some of Xtorm's USB-C products and came away pleased but not convinced by the prices. It then occurred to me that a little discount could go a long way in making these prices palatable so I reached out to Xtorm and got y'all a 20% coupon code discount. If you were interested in grabbing something from the company, this makes the products more competitive against other brands. </p>
<p> Xtorm makes EU-compatible (EU plug, 220V) hubs, chargers, and cables. The most interesting to me was the Vigor power hub since it marries one USB-C port, one USB QC 3.0 port, 4 regular 2.4A USB ports, and a Qi wireless charging pad on top. </p>
<p> There are many perks to living in the US: Google services availability, frequent Amazon deals, lower tech prices (on average), and the fact that many tech companies are based there, meaning you never have to worry about plugs and voltages when buying your gadgets. Cross the Atlantic and the story gets a bit more complicated. Each time we, the poor souls living in Europe and countries that follow the European electricity standards, want to buy something new that isn't officially available for us, we have to make sure it works on 220-240V and that as a bonus, it has an EU plug so we don't have to use a small adapter that will add weight and could cause the whole thing to fall off the wall at any time. </p>

<p> x venture </p>
<p> The budget phone space is incredibly competitive right now. The Moto G5 Plus is still king in this product category, but there are plenty of rivals like Nokia and Acatel selling great devices at inexpensive prices. LG has been making budget phones for a while now, but the X Venture is a bit different. The phone's priorities are durability and battery life, not specifications or performance. </p>
<p> After using the X Venture, I came away impressed. For $329, you get a decently-fast phone that can take a beating, all while lasting around two days on a single charge. It even has a few features you don't often see in phones around this price (at least in the US), like NFC support and a customizable 'QuickButton' that can open any app. </p>
<p> LG first launched its X-series line of phones halfway through last year, and it's been continuing to roll new models out. The latest in this saga is the AT&T-exclusive X venture, which, as you might be able to tell from its name, is a rather rugged device. AT&T calls it 'stylishly resilient,' but let's be honest - only half of that statement is true. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/xyboard/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17556194" filename="xyboard">
<p> xyboard </p>
<p> Hey! Remember they Droid Xyboards? No? Well, surprisingly, Verizon does. In fact, both the 8.2- and 10.1-inch versions are getting an OTA update that brings Jelly Bean (Android 4.1.2) right now. Fantastic. </p>
<p> So what does this mean for Xyboard owners? Some new stuff, pretty much. Like Google Now! And Chrome. And Movie Studio, according to Verizon's changelog. </p>
<p> See? Look at all that new stuff. Really, there aren't a lot of tangible differences between 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 aside from just knowing that you're a few versions behind. </p>
<p> So here's a new one: a carrier-branded device is going to get an Android version bump while its Wi-Fi only counterparts are stuck on an older version. This is against everything we've seen in the Android world since the dawn of time, where Wi-Fi devices normally surpass their cellular-connect brethren on a regular basis. To make the situation even more interesting, we're talking about Verizon devices here. </p>
<p> Here's the skinny: Motorola recently updated its upgrade page for the Verizon Xyboard twins, stating that they would each get updated to Android 4.1. </p>
<p> It was only a couple days ago that we heard the Ice Cream Sandwich update for the Motorola Xyboard Wi-Fi models would be rolling out. Now, Verizon has announced that the same update for the LTE version of the tablet is about to rollout to customers via an OTA upgrade. The package will be about 336.4 MB, so hope you're on Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Here are some of the changes you'll see with the upgrade: </p>
<p> Direct Access Lock Screen - The direct access lock screen takes you directly to Camera, Browser, Gallery or Unlock. </p>
<p> Hot on the heels of ASUS pushing out Jelly Bean to the TF300, Motorola has announced that ICS is now available for the Wi-Fi Xyboard 10.1 and 8.2. </p>
<p> The update should be rolling out OTA-style now, and brings a host of new features: </p>
<p> Updated Browser with faster rendering, zoom and pan: Users can also now save pages for offline reading and request desktop versions of websites. </p>
<p> Swipe to dismiss notifications and recent apps: You can now dismiss individual notifications and apps from the Recent Apps list with a simple swipe of a finger. </p>
<p> While Motorola tablets may not exactly be flying off the shelves, that hasn't stopped Motorola from trying everything they can to sell them. Occasionally they're even a pretty good deal! For example, right now you can get the 8.2" Xyboard with a free portfolio case (normally $39) and HD dock (normally $49) for $399. If 10.1" tablets are more your style, you can get the same deal on the larger model for $499. </p>
<p> Earlier today, Verizon officially announced the upcoming Droid XYBOARD's / XOOM 2's December 12th release date, but who really wants to wait this long just to grab all of its delicious wallpapers? Nobody, that's who, which is why all 11 of them are now looking for a new home, thanks to Droid Life. </p>
<p> Download them one by one (right click, then Save Link As) or grab the whole collection if you want - the choice is yours. </p>
<p> Big Red just took the wraps off of two new Motorola tablets that we've been hearing about for a while now: the DROID XYBOARD 10.1 and 8.2. Both tablets are running nearly identical specs, save for screen size: </p>
<p> 10.1-inch and 8.2-inch IPS display with Gorilla Glass </p>
<p> 1.2GHz dual-core processor </p>
<p> 1GB RAM </p>
<p> 5MP rear shooter, 1.3MP front camera </p>
<p> 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB available for XYBOARD 10.1; 16GB and 32GB options available for XYBOARD 8.2 </p>
<p> Android 3.2 - will be upgraded to Android 4.0 </p>
<p> Verizon 4G LTE </p>
<p> Each tablet was built to address a specific market - the XYBOARD 10.1 is made for productivity and the use of a "precision tip stylus," which is included in the box, while the XYBOARD 8.2 was designed with multimedia in mind and sports 2.1 virtual surround sound and a "high-definition display." </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/xz1-compact/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17559571" filename="xz1-compact">
<p> Back in August, Sony announced that the XZ2 family, XZ1 family, and XZ Premium would be receiving their Android 9 Pie updates in November. Last month, the XZ2 and XZ2 Compact received their OTAs ahead of schedule. Now, the XZ Premium, XZ1, and XZ1 Compact are getting theirs. </p>
<p> Android phone buyers have been begging Google for years to do something about the platform's typically slow updates. As of this month, Android 8.0 Oreo only has 0.3% market share among Android devices, Marshmallow (released in 2015) is still at 30%, and Lollipop (from 2014) sits at 27%. Google's latest attempt to solve this problem is 'Project Treble,' a major restructuring of Android that is part of 8.0 Oreo. </p>
<p> Most of you may be under the impression that Google's Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will be the first phones out with Android 8.0 Oreo. But it's not those two, or even the LG V30, that can claim that honor; it's actually Sony's Xperia XZ1. And now, you can grab one of these Oreo-toting phones for just a hair over $605 on Amazon through Focus Camera, with no tax charged unless you're in New York or New Jersey. </p>
<p> Sony has been a surprisingly developer-friendly Android phone maker, with its Open Devices program giving anyone the opportunity to build and flash custom versions of the OS firmware on its devices. A few days ago Sony published the relevant binaries for the latest AOSP version of Android 8.0 Oreo for a number of its phones, and now it's added two newer Xperia models. </p>
<p> The XZ1 and XZ1 Compact were launched at the end of August at IFA 2017 in Berlin. They're essentially the same as their predecessors, the XZ and X Compact, on the outside, with updated internals such as the Snapdragon 835. </p>
<p> Sony doesn't have much of a presence in the US, but it's still working hard to make appealing Android phones in other parts of the world. Case in point, the new Xperia XZ1 and XZ1 Compact have been unveiled at IFA 2017. Despite looking and feeling a lot like other recent Sony handsets, there's something notable—they're launching with Android 8.0 Oreo, which is still just rolling out to Google devices. As for the rest of the phones, well, it's pretty much what you'd expect from Sony. </p>
<p> Here at IFA 2017 in Berlin, Sony has taken the opportunity to unveil its latest flagship devices. The Xperia XZ1 and its Compact sibling are here to replace the year-old XZ and X Compact, and they offer slightly updated designs with the latest Snapdragon 835 processors, plus they'll also be among the first devices to ship with Android 8.0 Oreo. The mid-range 5.5" Xperia XA1 Plus was also introduced to fill the gaping hole between the 5" XA1 and 6" XA1 Ultra. </p>

<p> Pricing aside, Sony phones are generally well-liked. That means that an event such as Black Friday could be the perfect time to pick one up. Currently, we're seeing some decent sales on the last-gen Xperia XZ2 and Xperia XA2 Ultra, with a $50 discount on the Xperia XZ3 as well, from multiple retailers. </p>
<p> For developers wishing to tinker with Sony phones, the Open Devices program is a welcome official point of entry. The Japanese company adds most of its high-profile Android handsets to the list of supported devices after a little while, and the Xperia XZ2 and XZ3 are the latest to join the ranks. </p>
<p> Unlike many OEMs, Sony is actually pretty good at launching its phones with the latest build of Android. The Xperia XZ1 was the first phone to ship with Android 8.0 Oreo, and the XZ3 was the first to ship with Android 9 Pie. The XZ2 wasn't as unique as its siblings in that regard, but it is among the first to receive the Android 9 Pie update. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ2 and XZ2 Compact are arguably Sony's best-looking phones yet. Unveiled at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona in February, the latest Sony flagships have rear fingerprint sensors and sport 18:9 displays with far less bezel than we're accustomed to from Xperia devices. They both include the freshest Snapdragon 845 chip with 4GB of RAM and will ship with Android 8.0 Oreo. </p>
<p> I was impressed by them in my hands-on at MWC, especially in view of Sony finally embracing a more modern design aesthetic — even if the Compact is a little chunky. </p>
<p> Today at MWC 2018 in Barcelona Sony announced its latest flagship Android phones, the Xperia XZ2 and XZ2 Compact. Looking at them without context, you'd be forgiven for thinking they were released a couple of years ago. Yet these are Sony's most modern smartphone designs ever, with curved 3D glass and much smaller bezels than previous Xperia devices. </p>

<p> xz2 premium </p>
<p> Sony may not be doing so well in the smartphone business, likely due in part to how pricey its devices are. As we typically see with the Xperia line as time goes on, there's another sale on the XZ2 Premium over on Amazon. You can score yours for $599.99, $300 off the quite high MSRP. </p>
<p> Every week, I examine somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred app updates while looking for changes. The most interesting things turn into APK Teardowns or Download posts. Many of the remaining updates are unremarkable, amounting to a few bug fixes, routine updates to libraries, or even just pixel-level adjustments to layouts and images. However, there are usually a few updates that land somewhere in between. I don't want to spam readers with dozens of short posts, but I hate to ignore things that people might want to know about, so I'm going to wrap up the leftovers for a little weekend reading and call it Update Notes. </p>
<p> Sony's newest flagship device, the Xperia XZ2 Premium, was announced back in February. It has all the features you'd expect from a high-end 2018 smartphone, like a Snapdragon 845 processor, 6GB RAM, 64GB of storage (with microSD expansion), IP65/68 water resistance, and more. The updated design, with curved glass and a rear fingerprint sensor, was highly anticipated. </p>

<p> XZ3 </p>
<p> Sony's mobile division is a major money drain, having lost the company a billion dollars last year. Part of that can be attributed to pricing; for instance, it's hard to justify an Xperia XZ3 at its $799.99 MSRP when there are so many good offerings at that number. However, the XZ3 is now $487.27 on Amazon, making it a lot more appealing. </p>
<p> Sitting at about the six-month mark, Sony's late-2018 flagship XZ3 just got a nice discount over on Amazon. You pick up the incredibly capable phone for yourself for $585.22, a good $215 and change off the MSRP. </p>
<p> Pricing aside, Sony phones are generally well-liked. That means that an event such as Black Friday could be the perfect time to pick one up. Currently, we're seeing some decent sales on the last-gen Xperia XZ2 and Xperia XA2 Ultra, with a $50 discount on the Xperia XZ3 as well, from multiple retailers. </p>
<p> For developers wishing to tinker with Sony phones, the Open Devices program is a welcome official point of entry. The Japanese company adds most of its high-profile Android handsets to the list of supported devices after a little while, and the Xperia XZ2 and XZ3 are the latest to join the ranks. </p>
<p> For several years now, Sony fans and critics have been calling for the Japanese company to move away from its boxy, dated hardware design language and join its rivals in releasing a modern Android smartphone. When the Xperia XZ2 and XZ2 Compact arrived at MWC 2018 in February, we hailed them as a small step in the right direction. Curved glass and greatly reduced bezels around an 18:9 screen combined with high-end internals and a relatively stock treatment of Android — a recipe that was also followed for the overpriced XZ2 Premium that came in the summer. </p>
<p> It’s somewhat surprising that we’re talking about another flagship Sony phone so soon, yet the Xperia XZ3 stole the show at IFA 2018 and goes on sale at the beginning of October, just six months after the XZ2 was released and three months after the XZ2 Premium. </p>
<p> Every month or so, an update to ARCore rolls out to add the augmented reality framework to a whole new set of phones, tablets... and now Chromebooks? Yes, the first Chrome OS device has been found among the list of profiles included in the ARCore APK, and that is the recently released Acer Chromebook Tab 10. Also joining the list are the codenames associated with the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, blueline and crosshatch, which are due out this Fall. </p>

<p> xz premium </p>
<p> A few days ago, Sony Xperia XZ Premium owners may have seen news about the promised Android 8.0 Oreo release for their phone. According to Xperia Blog, Sony in Japan confirmed that the update would be coming in December, which fell in line with the earlier assurance that it would be rolled out before the end of the year. </p>
<p> December isn't far away, but there's now even better news, as Sony has just announced that the Oreo update is actually starting to roll out to the XZ Premium today. That's more than a month ahead of the previously stated date, and users will be thrilled to have their devices running the latest and greatest version of Android so soon. </p>
<p> Sony's phones are almost always more expensive than competing devices, and the XZ Premium is no exception. It arrived in the United States for a whopping $799, making it one of the most expensive (mainstream) phones on the market. Here we are, about a month and a half after its release in 'Murica, and the phone has already dropped $100. </p>
<p> Sony's latest phone, the Xperia XZ Premium, launched in the United States last week. As the name implies, it's a rather expensive phone ($799.99), but offers a few unique features like a camera capable of recording 960FPS slow-motion video. Sony has now added the phone to its Open Devices program, making it easy for developers to build AOSP for the device. </p>
<p> Back in 2015, Sony created the "Sony's Concept for Android" program. The result was something between a beta program and an alternate ROM that offered a mostly-stock Android experience with fast updates. Unfortunately, Sony has decided to end the program - at least for the Xperia X. </p>

<p> XZs </p>
<p> Sony has stuck to their design language over the years, offering a level of consistency that no other OEM can approach. Whether you have come to love or hate the bezel, the XZ and XZs are both great devices that offer the same Sony experience and software we've all come to expect. And, right now, you can pick up both the XZ ($329.99) and XZs ($515) brand new over at Daily Steals with our exclusive discount codes. </p>
<p> It seems to be the night of back-to-back Sony phone deals. Just a few weeks ago we posted that the Xperia XZs (I will never understand Sony's naming scheme) was down to $658 over on Amazon. Now it's gotten down to $619.99, but just for the black model. The XZs is a mid-season refresh of last year's XZ, featuring an updated camera and a bit of extra RAM. Although the 1.22µm pixels in the new camera aren't the largest, it does have a high 19MP resolution and can shoot in 4K, as well as 960fps slow motion video. </p>

<p> yahoo </p>
<p> Verizon-owned Yahoo has already made a few lightweight versions of its bloated applications, intended for Android Go devices or other phones with minimal amounts of memory/storage. The latest addition is Yahoo Lite, which is now available on the Play Store and only takes up around 1MB of space. </p>
<p> Yahoo Mail is one of the most popular apps under Verizon's combined AOL/Yahoo umbrella of web services, so it has naturally been loaded to the brim with bloat. The app already had dedicated tabs for online deals and shopping, neither of which have much to do with sending email, and now Yahoo is adding videos to the mix. </p>
<p> Compared to the earlier days of the internet, Yahoo isn't the most known or well-liked company around anymore. It's not even an independent business any longer, as it was bought by Verizon in 2017. That might be why it has decided it's time to create a mobile phone plan, which could help make it feel relevant again. The company is gearing up to launch Yahoo Mobile, a virtual network that relies on Verizon's infrastructure and gives you unlimited 4G data, texts, and calls for $40 a month. The website is currently only accessible via its URL; Google Search won't find it yet. </p>
<p> Yahoo was an internet heavyweight during the early years of the internet—before Google, of course. Today, Yahoo is a shell of its former self as a subsidiary of Verizon with no real search product of its own. It's trying to build one, though. The company's new One Search is available on the web and via an Android app. It's just Bing with some added features, but Yahoo promises it's really secure. </p>
<p> Android TV has been around for a few years at this point, and there are ample video streaming options. However, we've somehow limped along without a Yahoo app until now. Outrageous! The nightmare is finally over with the launch of Yahoo's Android TV client. Joking aside, Yahoo produces a lot of video, and you might want to watch some of it on your TV. </p>
<p> Yahoo Mail isn't quite as ubiquitous as it once was, but plenty of people use both the app and email service for their long-form communication needs in 2019. Today Yahoo is pushing out an entirely new version of the app, with modern focus on one-handed use with taller phones, faster access to attached files, and tools to help you save cash — plus a strange (but potentially useful) grocery coupon clipping tool that has nothing to do with email. </p>
<p> If there's one thing we don't have enough of in this world, it's messaging apps. Thankfully, Yahoo's latest creation is exactly that, and it's designed to simplify group communication between friends, family, and colleagues. You may have read about the invite-only Yahoo Squirrel app a few months back — well now it's out of testing and open to everyone. </p>

<p> yahoo finance </p>
<p> Download an app on your phone, link it to your bank account, contribute some money each month to a pool shared with a bunch of people you've never met before, and wait your turn to get a payout. I'm no mind reader, but you probably have one of two reactions to that proposition: "That sounds shady as all hell," or, "That sounds like something my parents did." Well, this is the general idea behind Yahoo Finance's new app called Tanda, and it probably warrants some explanation. </p>
<p> It looks like Fitbit's latest smatwatch has been leaked today. The writers over at Yahoo Finance managed to get ahold of some images of the new device, and it's very unique looking, with a brightly colored square beveled-edge aluminum unibody design, a textured rubber strap, and knurled buttons. It certainly sets itself apart from most other wearables. </p>

<p> yahoo mail </p>
<p> Yahoo Mail is one of the most popular apps under Verizon's combined AOL/Yahoo umbrella of web services, so it has naturally been loaded to the brim with bloat. The app already had dedicated tabs for online deals and shopping, neither of which have much to do with sending email, and now Yahoo is adding videos to the mix. </p>
<p> Yahoo Mail isn't quite as ubiquitous as it once was, but plenty of people use both the app and email service for their long-form communication needs in 2019. Today Yahoo is pushing out an entirely new version of the app, with modern focus on one-handed use with taller phones, faster access to attached files, and tools to help you save cash — plus a strange (but potentially useful) grocery coupon clipping tool that has nothing to do with email. </p>
<p> Yahoo may be the blurry ghost of what it once was, but there's no denying that millions of people still rely on their Yahoo email addresses as a means of communication. For those users and the millions of potential new users who may be getting a smartphone for the first time soon, Yahoo is optimizing its Mail service by introducing a new app for Android Go and a new mobile web experience. </p>
<p> Much as you've been able to use Gmail on Android to check other services' accounts, Yahoo has responded by adding support for more third-party services in its own app. Yahoo Mail users can now check email on Outlook and AOL accounts, in addition to existing Gmail support. </p>
<p> One of the most useful features of Android N is the improved notifications handling: notifications coming from the same app are bundled together and can be unbundled and dealt with individually, and there's direct reply support to quickly answer a message without opening the app. </p>
<p> Not a lot of apps have added support for both of these features, but now Yahoo Mail is joining this elite group. Thanks to a new update, Yahoo's mailing app lets you send direct replies to emails from the notification, and it bundles notifications together for less redundancy and clutter in the drop-down. </p>
<p> Yahoo is having a rough week in terms of security. It's probably just a coincidence that a considerable update for the official Yahoo Mail app comes days after one of the biggest password leaks ever. Even so, it's nice to get official support for something like Google's Fingerprint API. That, among other new goodies, is waiting inside the latest Mail update in the Play Store. On my Nexus 6, it's version 5.9.1. </p>
<p> Yahoo Mail might not be the trendiest web mail service on the planet, but it's still used by hundreds of millions of accounts (if not necessarily that many actual people). And somehow, the official Yahoo Mail app for Android has neglected to sync contact information with the operating system before now. That's been rectified, according to the Mail blog on the Yahoo-owned Tumblr. The latest version of the app in the Play Store, 5.5.3, confirms it in the changelog. </p>
<p> Ever used multiple inboxes in the same email app and wished there was an easy visual differentiator between each one? I know I have. And instead of Gmail fixing the problem, the solution comes to us courtesy of Yahoo's email application. </p>
<p> In the most recent update to Yahoo Mail, the app is getting a new theming feature where you could pick an individual color out of 11 possible options for each of your inboxes. Your Yahoo inbox could be purple, your Gmail could be red, and your Outlook could be blue. Or you can use a blue inbox for Yahoo — who's gonna stop you, you rebel! </p>
<p> Yahoo Mail may not have the proportion of users that it used to have, but there are still nearly as many people using the site as there are citizens in the US. With over 100 million installs, at least one or two people are using the Android app. Those folks are gaining a few new ways to manage their inbox in the latest update. </p>
<p> Yahoo Mail received a pretty big update a couple of months ago with an interface revamp to Material Design (or Yahoo's interpretation of it), Account Key to sign in on your mobile device without having to input your password, and support for other mail providers like Outlook, Hotmail, and AOL. You may have noticed that Gmail wasn't present in that list, but that changes today. </p>
<p> Yahoo! is rolling out an update to version 5.1 of Mail that adds Gmail support so you can start checking your Googly inbox from Yahoo's app. I don't know why you'd want to do that, but I'm sure there are valid reasons why such a feature would be important. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/yahoo-messenger/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17558578" filename="yahoo-messenger">
<p> Until today, I had no idea Yahoo Messenger even existed. But it most certainly exists, and if you happen to use it, you might be excited to learn you can now send video. The iOS and Android apps now support sending video, up to one minute long, in both one-on-one and group conversations. </p>
<p> Yahoo Messenger is pretty much your average messaging client, but there are some neat features. You can "unsend" messages and media in a conversation, it supports Google TalkBack, and there's even a native client for Windows and Mac. Which Hangouts still doesn't have, after all these years. </p>
<p> It's easy to laugh at Yahoo. Other tech brands like Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft have grown in prominence over the last ten years. But rather than improve, Yahoo has mostly just continued. It's still a giant presence. Millions of people use its services. It just doesn't grab headlines like the competition. </p>
<p> Well, Yahoo has now re-released one of its most widely known properties, Yahoo Messenger. </p>
<p> After a bunch of relatively uninteresting premium apps given out for free in Amazon's Android Appstore, today's offering is really quite refreshing. Users of the desktop version of Trillian will instantly recognize their beloved multi-network IM client's logo, and those new to it will find its features quite impressive: </p>
<p> support for AIM, Facebook, Live Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, ICQ, and, of course, Google Talk </p>
<p> Trillian synchronizes contacts, avatars, statuses, and accounts between Android, Mac, Windows, and Web clients </p>
<p> push notifications for those on Android 2.2+ </p>
<p> multiple chat windows, emoticons, and more </p>
<p> While Trillian is no longer my client of choice on the desktop (Digsby took that spot), I must say that if you're looking for a great multi-network IM client on Android, it's hard to go wrong with this [normally $4.99] offering from Cerulean Studios. </p>

<p> yahoo news digest </p>
<p> Android tablet users know what it's like to get stuck with a phone app stretched out to a large display. It's less of an issue today than it used to be, now that smartphones come with 1080p displays and apps sport visual elements that would look crisp on a television screen. But sometimes you're still left with an excess of white space or an interface that you can't spin horizontally, even though that's how you want to hold your tablet. </p>
<p> Well, Yahoo has updated its News Digest app to play along more nicely with Android tablets. The interface still looks similar to the highly stylized experience users have grown accustomed to on their phones, but now it's wider, and you get to swipe left and right. </p>
<p> Yahoo has released another Android app and - hey, come back here, this is actually cool - it's an attractive take on providing the news. Yahoo News Digest gathers bits of news from around the Internet (various reports, video, Wikipedia entries, Google maps, etc.) and puts them together to form a single story. The formula isn't quite the same as Circa's, but it should seem familiar to anyone accustomed to that bite-sized news app. Presentation is half the appeal here, and you may be pleased to know that Yahoo has done a good job creating an app that doesn't offensively ignore all of Android's taste in design. </p>

<p> Note: This is an adaptation of my Nexus 4 update/root post, so it has some duplicate content, but all the instructions and images are specific to the Galaxy Nexus. </p>
<p> A few days ago, Google pushed out the Android 4.2.2 (build JDQ39) update to the takju variants of the Galaxy Nexus. Takju Nexuses are the devices sold in the Google Play Store, whereas yakju ones can be found in other retail channels. Good news for those waiting on the latter - though a day after its sibling, we finally have the yakju OTA file that can be applied manually on any stock device, including unrooted ones with stock recovery. </p>
<p> About a week after the Takju variant of Samsung's Galaxy Nexus got its 4.2 update, it looks like the same is rolling out to the Nexus' Yakju variant. The update (build JOP40C), for those not willing to wait, is also available for manual download and flashing (check the link below). </p>
<p> It should be noted that this update is meant solely for the Galaxy Nexus Yakju – that's the international version not from the Play Store – and your device should be running build JZO54K before you try to install the update. </p>
<p> If you've been waiting for Android 4.1.2 to hit your GSM Galaxy Nexus (yakju), wait no more. Google has already begun the OTA process, but in case you haven't gotten yours yet, we've got the direct link for manual installation. Yay for you! Here's how to make it happen. </p>
<p> First and foremost, you'll need to meet a couple of prerequisites: </p>
<p> You must be using a yakju device. Not takju, yakjuux, yakjuxw, or any other variant. </p>
<p> In the last 2 days, we've seen a whole lot of Android 4.0.4 goodies. First, Google unleashed the Android 4.0.4 AOSP code, then followed up by sending out incremental OTA updates to the Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, and XOOM Wi-Fi. Maintaining the momentum, today our favorite Android release engineer JBQ today put together full OS images for the GSM Nexus S and GSM Galaxy Nexus, which can be used to completely restore compatible devices back to stock. </p>

<p> Millions of homes now contain a smart assistant speaker of some variety and sales of IoT products continue to grow as the market matures and prices come down across the sector. With so many options available, it's hard to know what to buy, and that's where we come in — this is a selection of our favorite smart home gadgets. Whether you want to just dip your toes in the water with a cheap Google Nest Mini or dive into the deep end with smart lights, cameras, thermostats, doorbells, and so on — we’ve got you covered. </p>
<p> Remote IFA festivities today continue, as Philips Hue has announced a handful of new and updated products in its smart home lighting lineup, including a new lightstrip for your TV and the revamped return of the Iris table lamp. On top of that, folks in the August and Nest smart lock ecosystem can look forward to deeper integrations between the two systems starting soon. </p>
<p> August and Yale smart locks are picking up a new feature that should make remote access just a little bit more secure. The opt-in change allows for remote biometric authentication before locking or unlocking your home's smart lock remotely. Further enhancing on-device security, there's a new Hide Entry Codes feature that — you guessed it — makes it so your entry codes can only be viewed for a short time. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/01/18 6:00am PSTon Jan 18, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/10 7:32am PDTon May 10, 2020. </p>
<p> Our homes are increasingly filled with gadgets that connect to the internet in ways that rightly have us concerned for our privacy and security. But when discussing those concerns, it's important to keep a level head and consider just what kind of privacy and security concerns actually stem from using these products, and in what instances they might actually enhance both for you in real, tangible ways. And like surveillance cameras, we think smart locks fall into such a category: they can actually make your home safer and more secure than a traditional, "dumb" lock, and they do it all while bringing a tremendous amount of convenience. </p>
<p> When Amazon launched its smart lock, it had the brilliant idea of coupling it with an option to let delivery people in to drop your packages when you're not home. Although it's a convenient approach, it's not necessarily reassuring to let strangers in. Yale came up with a solution to this problem, with the announcement of its smart delivery boxes. In addition, it also unveiled a connected cabinet lock and a safe, letting you secure items using your phone. </p>
<p> Fall is in full swing and there's a chill in the air (well, where I am, anyway). Warm your bones with some fine deals: today, you can get an Echo Dot for half off and two USB-C cables for just five bucks, plus savings on a cool Bluetooth speaker and some smart security gear. </p>
<p> We've arrived at July's final week, and we've got some great deals to cap the month off right. This week, you'll find a substantial discount on Jabra's excellent new noise-canceling headphones, plus money off the very competent Jaybird X4, Roku Streaming Stick+, and then some. </p>
<p> Smart lock maker Yale announced a new product at CES this year, designed to be fitted on doors that don't have deadbolts, which are generally required for grafting on smarts. The Assure Lever lock gets around that requirement by replacing your doorknob and lock assembly with a lever handle (hence the name) and keypad. </p>
<p> Arlo is at CES 2019 with a few interesting announcements. The security camera maker is expanding its portfolio with more integrations and a new security system. </p>
<p> When it comes to home security, peace of mind and convenience are what matter to me, making a smart lock pretty damn appealing. We know that homes generally aren't targeted by burglars for a lack of obstacles, but for an abundance of opportunity (like an unlocked door!), and a smart door lock leaves one less thing to chance when you're away on vacation or at the office. All the locks in the world probably aren't going to stop someone truly determined to break into your home - so unless you're barring your windows and using solid exterior doors (and most US homes aren't), I don't think the physical security argument has many legs to stand on. </p>

<p> Last year the XBMC project changed its name to Kodi, giving the media manager a much-needed fresh start considering how it has long since expanded past its original Xbox roots. Yatse is a popular remote app for use with the platform that recently got a spiffy material redesign. </p>
<p> Kodi (formerly the Xbox Media Center) isn't the only piece of software attempting to find a new image. One of the most popular Android remote control apps for the media manager, Yatse, is getting a major visual overhaul. Version 5.0, now available in a Google+ beta, is showing off a shiny new interface that takes more than a few pages out of the Material Design playbook. Check out some comparison shots below. </p>
<p> If Yatse is your go-to XBMC remote on Android, this weekend's update should be a nice surprise. If you're still looking for a good remote solution, now may be the time to check this one out. </p>
<p> In short, Yatse got bumped to version 4.0, which brings a handful of new features to the already-powerful application, like Chromecast support, Muzei integration, a newly designed interface, improved speed and stability, an internal audio player, and offline media support. </p>
<p> Let's be honest, most of us will never get to live in a crazy futuristic home like the Jetsons, but that doesn't mean we can't strive for a few of the simple luxuries. To that end, Doug Gregory is on track to make his living room smarter than the bridge of the USS Enterprise, all with a few electronic controllers and extensive use of Tasker. There's no way around it, you really need to see the video for this one. </p>

<p> If a smartwatch is in the deepest desires of your heart, but you just can't stand the idea of coughing up $350(ish) to get one of the higher end models, Newegg may finally be the company to get that death grip off your wallet with a new deal on the LG Watch Urbane (which is arguably the best Android Wear watch out there right now). </p>
<p> This works by utilizing a small collection of discounts, coupons, and mail-in rebates to get the price down from $350 to just $240. Here's the breakdown: </p>
<p> $30 instant rebate (read: you don't have to do anything) </p>
<p> $60 coupon code: EMCAWKW92 </p>
<p> $20 mail-in rebate </p>
<p> Yeah, that last bit is easily the crummiest part of this whole deal, because having to mail junk in and wait for however many weeks to get your prepaid Visa rebate card back basically sucks. </p>

<p> year </p>
<p> It's that time of the year again. What? No, not Christmas, that's still a ways off. It's Spotify Wrapped season. After all, the best thing about Spotify is discovering new music, and now you can take a tour of you musical tastes from the last year by numbers. And not only do you get some fun statistics to brag about (I beat you this year, Artem!), there are also a pair of new playlists: Your Top Songs 2018, and a rut-defying Tastebreakers for a glimpse at something new. </p>
<p> One of the best things about the music streaming service Spotify is the platform's incredible ability to customize itself to the listener. Its automatically generated playlists are second to none, making it easy to find new music you like. The holidays are also a special time for Spotify listeners, as we get to look back at the last year's listening habits in the form of customized playlists, and this year Spotify has turned it into an interactive experience: Your 2017 Wrapped. </p>
<p> There's been a lot of talk about AT&T's crusade against rogue tethering lately, and it all comes back to this AT&T text message sent to some poor iPhone customer(s): </p>
<p> AT&T Free Msg: We’ve noticed you’re continuing to enjoy the tethering feature with your smartphone service. Remember, you need a tethering plan ($45/mo, incl. 4GB) to use this feature, so we’re planning to update your line with the required plan soon. </p>
<p> Yes, the carrier everyone loves to hate is cracking down on unauthorized tethering - and they are automatically switching violators onto AT&T's 4GB data plan with tethering access, at a steep $45 a month. </p>
<p> Update: BGR just confirmed with AT&T that the early upgrade price bump listed for iPhones applies to all smartphones - that means early upgrade pricing for 2-year agreement customers will go up by 50 bucks on all Android phones. </p>
<p> Well, there's not a lot of ways to spin this positively, and it's pretty clear what's going on - AT&T is disincentivizing its 1-year and no contract plans in order to goad customers into making more economical 2-year agreements. Customer retention method much? </p>
<p> If you want to go month to month (no contract) on AT&T, the full retail price of your smartphone of choice will shoot up by $50, for no apparent reason other than to discourage you from making that decision. </p>
<p> The mobile industry is a very competitive, complicated, fast changing world. The name of the game, though, is simple: get your product out there, get people using it, and do it fast. Quantcast, a company that specializes in the world of internet usage trends, recently released some information showing how well the players in the mobile OS and software game are doing. The information is intriguing, to say the least. </p>
<p> There are several things we can take away from this information, the number one being that Android is definitely stepping its game. In the past year, the number of mobile internet users toting Android devices has increased by 18.6%, bringing Android's consumption share to an impressive 25%. </p>

<p> yearly </p>
<p> Android Police's bi-weekly roundups have covered more than 750 games this year. That's a hell of a lot for a site that's not specifically about gaming, and picking out the top five is no small task. Before you read any further, take note of the following: I had a few criteria that games had to meet before being included in the following selections. </p>
<p> Android has been around for eight years now. It's the most-used operating system on the planet, and it's helped spearhead a revolution in mobile access and capability. That being the case, it shouldn't surprise anyone if the truly mind-blowing new apps aren't exactly thick on the ground anymore. This year's crop of apps aren't especially amazing, but each one exhibits new functionality for users that wasn't accessible (or at least practical) before. All of them deserve a spot on your phone or tablet. </p>
<p> Please note that this offer ended on July 31, 2011. Please do not contact Sprint about getting an override on your upgrade anymore! </p>
<p> Last week we posted a poll asking Sprint customers which phone they were hoping to get next. A few commenters complained that they were victims of the Sprint Premier split, wherein people who were at the lower end of Premier previously were moved to Premier Silver, thereby losing their annual upgrades. We've heard quite a few people bitch complain about this since the split happened, but we're happy to report that Art from the Sprint Premier team stopped by to let us know that Premier Silver customers can actually get one more upgrade restored. </p>

<p> Waze is a pretty popular navigation app, even among Google diehards. In fact, Google actually bought Waze way back in 2013 for a little over one billion dollars and uses some of the data sourced by Waze in Google Maps. For many people who drive for a living or just happen to be on the road a lot, Waze's extra features when compared to Google Maps are something they just can't live without. </p>
<p> Today, in celebration of the Chinese New Year, Waze has announced that it's bringing improved Mandarin (both in Simplified and Traditional Chinese) voices to its app. </p>
<p> If you're an Android fan, which is not that far a stretch considering you're reading this, you've probably looked at Dead Zebra's Android Mini figurines and wished you had all the money to buy every single one. And now there's a new one for you to fawn over and maybe make you click that purchase button: a special edition Chinese New Year one for the Year of the Dog. </p>
<p> More than last year's Golden Rooster, the design is very reminiscent of Chinese culture and that bright red is gorgeous to look at. </p>

<p> Yelp </p>
<p> If you feel pretty strongly about a business, you might head to some place like Yelp to express your thoughts. But if you haven't been using its Android app lately, we can get why: it's cramped, has too many tabs to dip into, and even retains a few elements from Android's old Holo era. Well, we've been tracking a design overhaul that Yelp has been slowly dosing out and is meant to remedy all of those faults. </p>
<p> Since time immemorial, Yelp's Android app has been incredibly ugly. That ends today. The redesign that reached beta testing last month has been released to the general public. It's so much nicer than the old one. </p>
<p> There are a lot of outdated apps lurking in the Play Store, but Yelp's antiquated design has been particularly irksome. See, Yelp is a popular app that can be really useful, but it is just a mess of old design language. If you're in the Yelp beta, check your updates because things are about to change. Yelp 7.0.0-Beta1 is rolling out with a material overhaul. It's so much better, and we've got the APK below for your sideloading pleasure. </p>
<p> Business owners already keep up with Yelp, as reviews can make or break sales. But at the end of the day, the mobile app remains a consumer-facing piece of software, encouraging users to check out which establishments are hot and leave their own feedback. </p>
<p> While Yelp isn't changing its main app, it has released a separate one that acknowledges how much attention the people running restaurants and stores pay to the service. Yelp for Business Owners lets these folks follow analytics and reach out directly to consumers who leave them reviews. It goes so far as to deliver notifications whenever someone leaves a message or review. </p>
<p> So you know how when you don't understand what someone's saying on Google+, you click that conveniently located translate button that appears at the bottom of their post and whammo, everything suddenly makes sense? Well, Yelp is planning on bringing some of the magic over to its mobile app. Users will be able to click a button to instantly translate reviews. It may not sound like much, but it could really come in handy when traveling in a country where the local residents speak a different language and you really just want to know where to get a plate of breakfast without breaking the bank. </p>
<p> Yelp's Android app was updated to version 5.9 this afternoon, adding an apparently much-requested feature: messaging support. The Yelp app did not previously allow users to send one another messages, but this has now been remedied. Hooray! I guess. </p>
<p> Otherwise, there's nothing going on here - probably a few bug fixes, maybe some performance tweaks. Oh, and a Mitch Hedberg quote, a la Yelp's typically enjoyable changelogs: "I order the club sandwich all the time. And I’m not even a member, man. I don’t know how I get away with it." </p>
<p> Yelp has come to Japan, which means residents can now create accounts at yelp.co.jp and begin the tedious but necessary work of leaving nasty reviews for perceived slights from waiters and waitresses everywhere. Japan is the second Asian country to gain access to Yelp, with Singapore being the first back in 2012. Following this announcement, it only makes sense that the Yelp team added the ability to search using emoji when they did. After all, those popular icons did originate in the Land of the Rising Sun. </p>
<p> Coinciding with the launch, Yelp users can now place bookings at spas and salons. </p>
<p> Emoji convey a lot using very little, and now Yelp has tapped into this to speed up its searches. No, the results don't come in any faster. Rather, instead of typing out a word as long as "hamburger," just insert a picture of one. Want to hit up a bar? Head to the emoji section of your keyboard and drop in a frosty mug. Yelp will know what to do. </p>
<p> Everyone's favorite eatery index, Yelp, released a significant update to its Android app today (now version 5.5), finally replacing the increasingly stale search filters UI with something a bit more modern. In the process, Yelp also added a whole bunch of new search filters to fine-tune your quest for the best sandwich in town. </p>
<p> The new app boasts filters for Hot & New, Offering a deal, take-out, good for kids, good for groups, takes reservations, takes credit cards, wheelchair access, full bar or beer & wine only, outdoor seating, happy hour, TV, and free or paid Wi-Fi. And that's just for restaurants - the filters are dynamic, and the options you see will depend on just what it is you're searching for. </p>

<p> yes aqua is also water </p>
<p> If there's one market I've seen change dramatically over the last three years or so, it has to be the portable speaker scene. It went from being a category with a few mostly niche products that you had to convince yourself to spend a couple hundred bucks on to something pretty incredible - there's easily something for every type of person, lifestyle, and budget on the market right now. And really, it keeps getting better. More features, better sound quality, improved portability, and increased battery life are all things that we continuously see these days. </p>
<p> While we've looked at waterproof (or completely submersible) speakers in the past, the Nyne Aqua stands apart from the crowd with one very unique feature: it's not only waterproof, but it also floats. </p>

<p> Several news outlets are reporting receiving invitations from Google for an announcement set to take place at the 2019 GDC (Game Developer Conference) next month. Details included in the invitation itself are sparse, apparently stating only that "all will be revealed" at a keynote during the conference on March 19th at 10AM PT, 1PM ET. This effective announcement of an upcoming announcement has renewed speculation surrounding Google's potential entry into the game-streaming market. </p>
<p> Earlier this year, rumors began circulating about 'Yeti', a game streaming service from Google. Much like Nvidia GeForce NOW and other platforms, it would allow users to play modern games on low-end hardware (because the rendering is done by off-site servers). Kotaku has now confirmed this information, and provided additional details. </p>

<p> Yi 4K Action Camera </p>
<p> Are you looking for an action camera to document the weekend's not-so-wise decisions? The Yi Lite is currently on sale for $51, a further 15% off its already discounted price of $60. The lowest we've ever seen this drop to is $46 back during last year's Black Friday festivities, and since that offer didn't last too long, this one might be your best bet for getting a deal. </p>
<p> Action cameras are a great way to capture, well, action. Designed to be both tough and low profile, they're easy to strap to your body to record your adventures hang gliding (or whatever). They're generally pretty pricey, though, with some high-end models going for hundreds of dollars. The Yi 4K Action Camera is already a nice bargain at its normal price of $121.99, and you can currently get 20 percent off the little guy on Amazon. </p>
<p> In the market for an action cam? Here's something: the YI 4K+/60fps Action Camera is on sale at Amazon for just $229.99 with a coupon code. It even comes with a waterproof case so you can safely capture all your whitewater kayaking high jinks. </p>
<p> I'll admit that I don't know the first thing about action cameras, except that GoPros are a thing. If you're not like me in that regard, then you may be interested in this deal over on Amazon. You can pick up the white Yi 4K action camera for $143.99, a total savings of $55. </p>
<p> Few would argue that GoPro is the king of the action camera world. It's the brand of choice for professional film crews and amateur enthusiasts alike and dominates the competition in terms of market share and brand recognition. GoPro's current flagship model, the HERO4 Black, is touted by many as the best action cam on the market. </p>
<p> A couple of weeks ago, GeekBuying.com asked if I would be interested in reviewing a new GoPro competitor, the YI 4K Action Camera. They claim that it matches or beats the GoPro HERO4 Black in almost every way for just a little more than half the price ($250 vs $449). </p>

<p> Yi Technology's Kami subbrand is known for its inexpensive but well-built smart home devices, including security technology. After introducing its first wire-free, battery-powered indoor camera a few months ago, the company has now taken the wraps off a similar cordless outdoor camera that's rated for up to six months of battery life on a single charge and should help you keep an eye on your house's exterior. </p>
<p> The holidays are almost here, but if you still haven't found gifts for someone, here's your chance. Yi Technology's Happy Holiday Savings sale has some of its best products up to 50% off. Dash cams, security cameras, 360-degree VR cameras, and action cams are all discounted. If you order today, you'll receive your items in time for Christmas. </p>
<p> Yi Technology is a Xiaomi-backed Chinese company that makes various digital imaging products, including affordable but feature-filled security cameras. The Yi Dome is already good value at $99.99, but Amazon is offering it at an even lower price as one of its daily deals. </p>
<p> Getting your home or office set up with security cameras can be an expensive proposition. For example, a Nest Cam Outdoor costs a whopping $200. Yi Technology has just announced a similar device priced at half that. The new Yi Outdoor Camera is just $99.99, and it's available now. </p>

<p> It's been quite a while since Lenovo last released a ThinkPad-branded Chromebook, but it's now back with the C13 Yoga convertible. The productivity-focused machine is powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 3700C Series processor and comes with a slew of ports and features. It starts at $579, although a range of optional extras can be added to configure the ThinkPad to your needs. </p>
<p> While I'm sure very few people have yearned for a broccoli or a cricket emoji on WhatsApp, there are plenty of other emojis that were still missing from the app compared to the Android 8.0 emoji set and Apple's latest set. The monocle, star eyes, swearing face, vomiting face, shushing face, exploding head, and many more were still missing from WhatsApp even when the app revamped its entire emojis early this month and introduced its own set. </p>
<p> With the latest beta 2.17.397, WhatsApp brings all of these missing emojis to the table. It's true that you could receive these before in conversation, but you couldn't send them and now you can. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Yoga A12 is the company's latest attempt at an Android tablet/laptop thing. It is a more toned-down version of the Yoga Book with lower specs, no Windows or Chrome OS options, and a lower price point to boot. The device was not supposed to be available until February 8, but both the Lenovo store and Amazon are allowing full purchases. Maybe because it's already the 8th on the other side of the world? </p>
<p> Lenovo has announced the Yoga Tab 3 Plus, a mid-sized tablet that the company claims is better than a portable television, at IFA in Berlin. The Chinese company is specifically touting the Tab 3 Plus's screen and audio. </p>
<p> I've always been intrigued by Yoga but I never really got into it or figured how to do it. Now might be the time to actually get started, or at least be a little less terrified of getting started with it, thanks to these new Google cards. </p>
<p> When you search for any Yoga pose, whether using the Sanskrit name (like Adho Mukha Svanasana) or the English one (which is Downward Dog), Google will serve you a little detailed information without you even having to go comb through different sites to find it. You get several images showing the pose, a description with the multiple names it's known as in different languages, the muscles it strengthens, and the pose type. </p>
<p> Lenovo's kickstand-packing Yoga tablets are already unconventional, but the new Tablet 2 Pro is downright odd. In addition to a relatively huge 13.3" screen and a built-in subwoofer, this beast of a device packs a pint-sized Pico projector into the curve of its kickstand hinge. Lenovo claims that the Tablet 2 Pro was developed with "product engineer" Ashton Kutcher, in case it wasn't already weird enough. The redesigned kickstand also includes a cutout that pulls double duty as a hole for the camera and a handy hanging point. </p>
<p> Here's a video with young, attractive people using a $500 tablet to match their $500 van. </p>
<p> Lenovo's initial Yoga tablets were novel thanks to their curved chassis with plus-sized batteries and integrated kickstands, but the lackluster specs (headlined by MediaTek processors) turned a lot of hardware fans off. The refreshed version of the 10-inch Yoga fixed that with a slightly better Snapdragon 400, 2GB of RAM, and a 1920x1200 screen. You can pick up a Yoga 10 Tablet HD+ for $100 off from Amazon, bringing the price down to a more reasonable $249.99. </p>
<p> The extra junk in the trunk from the case gives the Yoga a three-stage kickstand that folds up when not in use, not to mention a little extra space for stereo front-facing speakers and a 9000mAh battery. </p>
<p> Regular slate tablets are not for you. No sir/ma'am, you demand flexibility and utility from your electronics. Lenovo's Yoga line might be more accommodating for your needs, since it uses a unique chassis that combines a kickstand, an ergonomic handle, a massive battery pack, and a pair of stereo speakers into one bulbous side of the device. Today's Best Buy deal of the day is the 8-inch Yoga Tablet, on sale for $70 off. </p>
<p> That still makes the Yoga Tablet 8 $179.99, which is a bit of a tough sell for a device with a 1.2Ghz Mediatek processor, 1GB of RAM, and a pedestrian 1280x800 screen, putting it at about the same technical level as the original Nexus 7. </p>
<p> My love of devices with built-in kickstands is well-documented. So it's no surprise that Lenovo's Yoga Tablet line, which is more or less built around the kickstand (or at least a big, rounded, multi-purpose hump that holds the kickstand and several other neat things) would catch my attention. The first versions were brought down by sub-par hardware, but Lenovo is back with the Yoga Tablet 10 HD+, which addresses a lot of the issues with the original. </p>
<p> First and most importantly, the device gets a considerable specification boost. The screen is now a full 1920x1200 panel, which has become more or less a must have when you're selling a full 10-inch tablet. </p>
<p> Want a sweet deal on a Lenovo tablet? Well even if you don't, Best Buy is offering it, so pass this on to someone who does. Best Buy is offering significant discounts on both the unique Yoga Tablet 8 and the more conventional IdeaTab S6000. For today only, the 8-inch Yoga is $199.99 on the online store, a full $50 off. That's even better than the Lenovo perks site. The 10-inch S6000 is $239.99, $40 off of retail. Both are offered with free shipping or in-store pickup. </p>
<p> The Yoga Tablet is the more interesting choice here, thanks to its unique curved form factor and integrated kickstand that folds right into the body. </p>

<p> Lenovo's Yoga Book was one of the more interesting hardware launches of last year. It had the form factor of a 2-in-1 laptop, but the bottom panel could switch between a touch keyboard and a drawing pad. At launch, both Windows and Android models were available. </p>
<p> Back in December, a Lenovo executive stated that a Chrome OS variant would be released in 2017. Unfortunately, a recent Chromium commit discovered by Chrome Unboxed seems to indicate that the model will not see the light of day. </p>
<p> I wanted to review one of Lenovo's unique tablet-with-a-kinda-sorta-keyboard-touchpad models as soon as I saw them. My Android Police colleagues thought the core idea behind the Yoga A12 was dumb, saddling the flexibility of a tablet with the extra size and weight of a laptop while taking away its greatest advantage, a full keyboard. So I asked Lenovo for a review unit. They told me no. That probably should have been a second hint that this wasn't going to be an especially impressive product. </p>
<p> Lenovo's Yoga Book was released last year, featuring a 'Halo' keyboard - combining an active digitizer and touch keyboard. The device has received plenty of media attention, and is available in a $499 Android version or $549 Windows version (with an upcoming Chrome OS option), both with a 10.1" display. </p>
<p> The Yoga Book is definitely one of the most interesting and divisive laptop designs to come out in a while - users either love or hate its touchscreen/keyboard deck hook. To a digital artist its integrated "Create Pad" is a godsend, but a mechanical keyboard fan probably sees its integrated haptic key layout as sacrilege. Either way, you'll soon have more options if you want to check out that unique hardware: a Lenovo executive told a Tom's guide reporter that the Yoga Book would be sold in a Chrome OS model in 2017. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Yoga Book is... odd. When it was announced in September, it was very different from any laptop or convertible I had seen before. Instead of the standard keyboard and touchpad combination, the bottom panel is a giant Wacom digitizer for sketching and taking notes. When you need to be productive, the bottom panel can switch to the 'Holo keyboard,' a touch keyboard and trackpad in the typical laptop layout. </p>
<p> Now that reviews are out, what is the general consensus? Everyone who has tried it remarks about how amazing the device looks in person. LaptopMag called it, "one of the most beautiful pieces of technology I've ever laid my eyes upon," in their review. </p>
<p> Lenovo turned a lot of heads when it announced its latest Yoga design, the Yoga Book. It's essentially a convertible laptop with a fold-back screen, complete with the Yoga line's well-regarded watch band hinge. But the Yoga Book has an ace up its sleeve: instead of a conventional keyboard, it uses a gigantic touch-sensitive panel that includes a dedicated keyboard mode, with virtual backlit "keys" that can be activated at a touch. Windows and Android versions are being made, and the latter is now up for pre-order. </p>
<p> Lenovo's Yoga Book is what the company is calling, "the first tablet for natural sketching and note-taking," and "the world's thinnest and lightest 2-in-1." What makes this tablet so special? Lenovo's "halo keyboard." Much to the chagrin of typists everywhere, this is a purely touch keyboard, which makes the "thinnest and lightest 2-in-1" claim true. But Lenovo claims over 18 months of development work has gone into testing and improving the halo keyboard, including features such as haptic feedback and accidental keypress detection. </p>

<p> Yoga Chromebook </p>
<p> We see a lot of Chromebook deals pop up from time to time, but today's, courtesy of Best Buy, is definitely one worth noting. Right now, you can pick up Lenovo's excellent Yoga Chromebook C630 (1080p model) for just $549, and you get a free Google Home Mini thrown in for good measure. </p>
<p> Back at IFA last year, Lenovo announced that it would be releasing a premium Chromebook, which got a bunch of us excited. Dubbed the Yoga Chromebook, it impressed with its clean visuals and promising spec list and price tag. The base i3/1080p model was available back in October for a mere $599.99, but the 4K configuration was yet to be seen. Well, Lenovo sneakily put it up for purchase, along with a new 1080p variant. </p>
<p> Lenovo has made plenty of Chromebooks in the past, but just about all of them have been low-end models. The market for premium Chrome OS devices has really taken off over the past year, and just yesterday, Dell announced its first high-end Chromebook. Lenovo just unveiled three new Chrome OS laptops, including the first Yoga-branded Chromebook. </p>

<p> Lenovo isn't really known for putting out the best Android tablets on the market, and last year's lackluster YOGA tablets are a perfect example of that. The design seemed nice, but both the eight and 10 inch versions of the device were simply lacking in the spec department. Lenovo is looking to change that stance this year with the all new YOGA Tablet 10 HD+, which takes what worked with the original's form factor and stuffs it full of mostly decent hardware. </p>
<p> The 10 HD+ also features some proprietary Lenovo software, which the company calls its "DOit" suite. </p>

<p> yoga tablet 10 hd+ </p>
<p> Lenovo's initial Yoga tablets were novel thanks to their curved chassis with plus-sized batteries and integrated kickstands, but the lackluster specs (headlined by MediaTek processors) turned a lot of hardware fans off. The refreshed version of the 10-inch Yoga fixed that with a slightly better Snapdragon 400, 2GB of RAM, and a 1920x1200 screen. You can pick up a Yoga 10 Tablet HD+ for $100 off from Amazon, bringing the price down to a more reasonable $249.99. </p>
<p> My love of devices with built-in kickstands is well-documented. So it's no surprise that Lenovo's Yoga Tablet line, which is more or less built around the kickstand (or at least a big, rounded, multi-purpose hump that holds the kickstand and several other neat things) would catch my attention. The first versions were brought down by sub-par hardware, but Lenovo is back with the Yoga Tablet 10 HD+, which addresses a lot of the issues with the original. </p>

<p> yoga tablet 8 </p>
<p> Regular slate tablets are not for you. No sir/ma'am, you demand flexibility and utility from your electronics. Lenovo's Yoga line might be more accommodating for your needs, since it uses a unique chassis that combines a kickstand, an ergonomic handle, a massive battery pack, and a pair of stereo speakers into one bulbous side of the device. Today's Best Buy deal of the day is the 8-inch Yoga Tablet, on sale for $70 off. </p>
<p> In a world where almost all tablets are boring black slabs, Lenovo is trying to make some headway with a different design. Now you can experience Lenovo's take on the tablet for $60 less than usual – the Yoga Tablet 8 is on sale for $189.99 at Best Buy today only. That's better than the last such deal. </p>
<p> The Yoga Tablet 8 has a neat little stand that can be used to prop it upright or position it at a comfortable incline. </p>

<p> Update 3: ZodTTD, developer of several well-known emulators, recently met a similar fate as yongzh - both his Market account and his apps were removed. Today, he decided to clarify a few things in a blog post, noting that the removal of the apps was not due to an open source violation but rather came as a result of a trademark infringement letter from Sony to Google concerning PSX4Droid's icon. </p>
<p> ZodTTD and yongzh have released Android’s first PlayStation emulator application, now available in the Android Market for $6.99USD. Remember, that $6.99 does not get you any games or a working BIOS (required to run the emulator), you have to “legally” obtain these on your own time (please do not post links to ROMs or BIOS images in comments, they will be deleted). </p>

<p> Making your home smarter is probably on more people's minds than ever right now, but it can become a seriously dizzying project just remembering all the various voice commands and apps involved, to the point that you might even want a dedicated piece of hardware for controlling it all. Kind of like a universal TV remote, but for light bulbs, cameras, and smart thermostats. And using an old smartphone, you basically can, just as long as it isn't too old. </p>
<p> Sonos products are praised for a lot of good reasons, but integration with other smart home ecosystems isn't one of them. Until recently, you'd have had to use some separate hardware or scripts to control any Sonos speaker, but no longer. Google has added support for Yonomi to the Google Home and Google Assistant, and since Yonomi supports Sonos natively, that means that controlling your Sonos speakers with Google Home no longer requires a workaround. </p>
<p> All of these "smart" devices in our lives sure are creating a mess for us. We have to remember to charge them and take the time to set them up properly, every gadget has its own app on our phone, and none of them seem to be able to communicate effortlessly with each other unless they come from the same manufacturer, and even then... That's where Yonomi comes into the picture. </p>
<p> With one app, Yonomi aims to solve the mess that is our connected life. It integrates with some of the big players out there, like Nest, Jawbone, Sonos, Philips Hue, and Belkin WeMo, as well as your Android phone or tablet. </p>

<p> The New York Times has recently released an application for Android, and it looks great! </p>
<p> Appearing on the Android Market following releases on both the iPhone and WebOS platforms, the NYT application looks extremely similar to its iPhone counterpart. You can access news from an abundance of sections via a drop down menu, similar to how you’d pull down the notification bar. </p>
<p> The interface is extremely simple, and easy to navigate. </p>
<p> Andy Rubin, VP of Engineering at Google, recently gave an interview to the New York Times, touching on topics ranging from Flash to North Korea. With Google vying for top place in the smartphone market, Rubin seemed confident that Android devices can overtake the number of iPhones, saying </p>
<p> I don’t know when it might be, but I’m confident it will happen. Open usually wins. </p>
<p> When commenting on the number of Android devices that are currently on the market, Rubin said that the driving force behind Android taking off is the fact that it’s open and available to so many manufacturers, commenting on how </p>

<p> yota devices </p>
<p> In an era where most smartphones all look and function mostly the same, it's always a shame to see more interesting designs fall flat. Russian-based phone manufacturer Yota, best known for its line of Yota Phone devices with rear e-ink screens, has declared bankruptcy and all its assets will be liquidated. </p>
<p> When a large tech company starts to fail, there's a real downside regardless of how we feel about its product. People lose their jobs. Often, thousands do. Many of these people then find themselves having to move to another state or country to continue working in their chosen field. </p>
<p> But there's an upside as well. A large layoff means there are plenty of qualified workers who are looking for work, and what better way is there for a company to acquire hot talent than to move to where the people are? That's the idea Yota Devices, currently based in Moscow, is having. </p>

<p> yotaphone </p>
<p> In an era where most smartphones all look and function mostly the same, it's always a shame to see more interesting designs fall flat. Russian-based phone manufacturer Yota, best known for its line of Yota Phone devices with rear e-ink screens, has declared bankruptcy and all its assets will be liquidated. </p>
<p> Yota's unconventional hardware design has gained the company a lot of press, but following the Mobile World Congress debut of the YotaPhone 2, we've heard nary a peep for the better part of a year. That changed today in a Moscow presentation: the second-gen phone with a built-in e-ink screen on the rear of the case will go on sale in 20 European countries later in December, presumably including Russia. The price will be 33,000 Rubles, approximately $610 or 495 Euro, though taxes and fees may push it higher in some places. </p>
<p> After Europe, the YotaPhone 2 will expand to China and other Asian countries in early 2015, followed by Canada and Latin America. </p>
<p> I honestly think the YotaPhone was one of the coolest smartphone innovations of 2013, and while I wouldn't exactly be the first in line to buy a device from an unproven OEM, Yota Devices has once again piqued my curiosity with their announcement of the "next generation" YotaPhone here at MWC. </p>
<p> The new YotaPhone solves what was arguably the biggest problem with the original's otherwise innovative concept - interacting with the e-Ink display. On the old device, this was done via a series of gestures on a touchpad along the bottom of the e-Ink panel. On the new YotaPhone, the panel is fully touch-enabled, eliminating the need for that less than perfect workaround. </p>
<p> The YotaPhone was one of the only genuinely exciting mobile products to come out of CES 2013 nearly a year ago. If you've been itching to get your hands on this interesting combo device, you can lay down your money right now... so long as you're laying down Rubles. YotaPhone just started online sales of its LCD/E-Paper combo phone in Russia. Our Russian readers can pick one up for 19,990 Rubles (about $600 USD). </p>
<p> The company will be expanding its distribution quickly. The online YotaPhone store will be shipping to Austria, Germany, France, and Spain starting in mid-December, with expansion to the United Kingdom, Greece, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran and Egypt in January. </p>
<p> Another CES has passed, and with it comes clearer understanding of what's on the tech product horizon in the coming year. If I were to sum it up in a simple list? Touchscreens, 4K, and washing machines. </p>
<p> And that's the reason I stand by the proposition that this year's show wasn't very good. But, let's save that for the end. CES is still the most important tech show in the world, it's still massive, and there's still a metric crapton of stuff unveiled at it every year. So, in the Android realm, what was noteworthy this time around? </p>
<p> And if you want the full scoop, hit up this link, where you'll find all of our CES 2012 coverage, page by page. </p>
<p> This year's CES sucks. But that doesn't mean there can't be a few genuinely cool things floating around out there in an otherwise dull ocean of 4K and touchscreens. Case in point: YotaPhone, which sadly isn't even on the CES show floor at all. We covered the announcement of the YotaPhone, but really, seeing and using it in person does the idea so much more justice. </p>
<p> On paper, it seems pretty straightforward: a phone with a screen on both sides. A traditional LCD panel on the front, and an e-ink display on the back. In fact, it sounds incredibly gimmicky on paper - a crazy idea bound to be clunky and poorly executed. </p>
<p> Looking to "rebalance the relationship" between humans and their smartphones, Moscow-based Yota Devices has announced the YotaPhone, a smartphone with an LCD display on one side, and an e-ink screen on the back. </p>
<p> The reason behind (between?) the dual screens, Yota says, is to deliver the information users want, right when they want it, without disengaging from the real world by pressing a power button and unlocking a screen. Users can choose to see information ranging from news stories to social media updates, calendar entries, and more. The information updates itself constantly, and is always ready to be looked at. Since the e-ink display uses very little battery power, the phone's 2100mAh pack should allow users to enjoy usage comparable to devices with a single display. </p>

<p> yotaphone 2 </p>
<p> The dual-screen e-paper/LCD YotaPhone 2 has a sufficiently interesting gimmick that it was able to rack up almost $300,000 on Indiegogo last month. However, the Russian smartphone maker has reached out to backers to share some sad news. It is unable to get the North American variant manufactured in a timely manner, so it's cancelling the device entirely. </p>
<p> In what sounds like a perversion of the crowd-funding concept, Yota has taken to Indiegogo to bring a phone that has existed since early 2014 into existence... in North America. To perform this undertaking, the company wants a paltry $50,000, and it has set a flexible funding goal to get the funds. Fortunately that's irrelevant, because it has already shattered that bar in under three hours with the help of nearly 100 funders. </p>
<p> While the video makes a mention of this campaign's purpose, it's easy to browse the Indiegogo page and get the impression that the YotaPhone 2 isn't yet a thing. </p>
<p> The YotaPhone 2 and its predecessor have always intrigued me. They're probably the only significant departure in form factor available on the market right now that isn't different for the sake of being so, adds value, and has been relatively successful in its endeavor. After its European release last December, the YotaPhone 2 is coming back with a new color variant: white. And it looks striking if you ask me, especially with that new E Ink white theme where the old interface's colors are inverted. </p>
<p> But let's back up. The white YotaPhone 2 keeps the same specs as the black one: a primary 5-inch Full HD AMOLED screen, a 4.7-inch 960x540 E Ink screen on the back, a Snapdragon 801 processor, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and an 8MP rear camera. </p>
<p> Since Yota itself hasn't been all that forthcoming with the phone's detailed specs, we're glad to see the reviewer list them out. </p>
<p> Update: It looks like a few English-speaking news outlets have been given early review units as well. Engadget has one, and so does Cnet, among a few less-reliable sites. Cnet was kind enough to post a video, embedded below. </p>
<p> Are you curious to see how the versatile YotaPhone 2 performs in the real world? So are we. But with a launch in Russia and Europe scheduled for later this week and no US launch in sight, we'll have to admire it from afar. One Russian technology site is a little more lucky, however: Hi-Tech.mail.ru has managed to snag a review unit. </p>

<p> When I saw the prototype YotaPhone last year at CES 2013, I was legitimately impressed with the concept - a smartphone with a standard, full-color display on the front, and a black and white e-ink panel on the back. The applications, functional and aesthetic alike, were not difficult to see. </p>
<p> But the original YotaPhone was quite hefty, both displays were a bit small at 4.3", and the e-Ink panel wasn't actually touch-enabled, but rather was controlled by a capacitive touch panel along the bottom of the device. And, honestly, it wasn't exactly what I'd call pretty - it looked like an engineering prototype, not a piece of consumer hardware. </p>

<p> A small but vocal group of us continue to feel defeated by the ever-expanding size of mainstream smartphones. The "good old days" of smaller screens really are starting to feel like a time long past, barely a glimmer on the horizon of technology's rapid advance in the smartphone era. If you're one of these people willing to put their money where there mouth is and actually buy a "tiny" phone, there are options—like the dinky Unihertz Jelly 2 with its 3" screen. While I enjoyed the previous Unihertrz Jelly Pro (which I bought for myself as a gag, but did not review for Android Police), it was a novelty I honestly couldn't recommend. </p>

<p> Every other month, a legitimate, useful app gets kicked off the Play Store while sleazy applications with bad intentions thrive. Google's removal algorithms often cite arbitrary reasons as in the recent case of Slide for Reddit. The third-party client was removed for including a screenshot of an article in its listing that contained the word "ISIS" (which had been there for years). The latest app to be hit by Google's automated patrol is YouMail, a visual voicemail service that offers spam call protection. </p>
<p> Update: Looks like YouMail has gotten to the bottom of the issue. Turns out that it was a bug in the code (a bug they were aware of, no less) and they didn't realize how severe the issue actually was. They've since corrected the issue (or are in the process of), and will be back in the Android Market shortly. For full details, check out the YouMail Blog. </p>
<p> YouMail, a popular (and free) visual voice mail solution, mysteriously disappeared from the Android Market today. In an email notification, the makers of YouMail were informed that the app was pulled due to a complaint from T-Mobile that the app was causing "adverse network disruption." </p>

<p> Your people </p>
<p> Google Assistant is becoming ever more capable, though it's moving rather slowly. The company is only now introducing an option to make it less chatty on phones right, and no-brainers such as simplified responses to light requests have taken way too long to arrive. Thus, it's nice to see Google simplifying another task that was previously only executable via voice. The Your people section in the Assistant's settings now allows you to assign custom relationships to contacts. It also gives you an improved overview of your family group (AKA Family Link or the "family" you've set up on the Play Store to share purchased apps with friends). </p>
<p> Google is gearing up for the weekend with another beta update to its self-named app. The latest version brings some very minor visual tweaks, but as usual, it's the teardown where the real activity can be found. The latest update expands a bit on the previously seen Your People screen and Google Assistant for Households by adding personal details to contacts. There will also be an option to enable or disable Assistant on the Pixel Buds while your phone's lockscreen is active. And finally, something called Dragon Glass is in the works. </p>

<p> Your Phone </p>
<p> Microsoft announced a handful of improvements for its Your Phone Android-to-Windows integration and app-streaming back at Samsung's unpacked event on August 5th. The changes revealed brought tools like an app launcher on your desktop and the ability to pin apps to your taskbar and Start menu. Well, now that you can actually get a Note20 or Note20 Ultra, Microsoft has started rolling the feature out to the general public and is no longer an "Insider" exclusive. </p>
<p> Microsoft's 'Your Phone' app allows you to connect any Android phone to a Windows 10 PC, but some features require deeper system integration. If you have a Galaxy Note20, you can use your mobile apps from your Windows PC, and the same functionality will be available on the Surface Duo at launch. </p>
<p> Microsoft's Your Phone application enables Android users to take advantage of features like phone calling and controlling music playback right from a PC. In today's Galaxy Unpacked event, Microsoft and Samsung announced a few Samsung-specific improvements to the Your Phone app and teased that the capability to run multiple apps at once will be coming later this year. </p>
<p> No matter how much we slam Apple for its closed ecosystem, many of us often find ourselves raving about how well coordinated the iPhone and Mac are. Then we turn to Android, which just can't do all those tricks, leaving us feeling a little peeved— at least until Microsoft came into the picture. Microsoft has all but adopted Google’s mobile OS after its own phone business crumbled, and it has increasing sought to bridge the deep divide between Windows 10 and Android with the Your Phone app. </p>
<p> If you have a phone paired to your Windows 10 machine with the Your Phone app, you'll be able to take advantage of a small improvement that may be useful to those of you who prefer listening to content on your Android device while you're working on the desktop. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/14 6:30am PDTon Apr 14, 2020 and last updated 2020/04/24 8:36am PDTon Apr 24, 2020. </p>
<p> The Your Phone app from Microsoft is a powerful productivity tool that bridges the gap between Windows and Android for cross-platform interaction. While the basic suite is open to most Android handsets, Microsoft tends to favor Samsung phones with newer features, and such was the case with RCS messaging and screen mirroring. Your Phone is now adding drag and drop for files, which, you guessed it, will again be available exclusively on a handful of Galaxy models. </p>
<p> Microsoft and Samsung partnered up to bring us an enhanced version of the Your Phone service that connects Android phones with Windows machines. The Korean company promised to add even more exclusive improvements to the syncing utility for the Galaxy S20 and the Z Flip, like cross-platform copy and pasting and RCS support. As part of the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Build announcement, the partners took the chance to make good of that word. </p>
<p> Microsoft’s love for Android has only grown over the last few months as the Your Phone app has gotten better and more functional with a bevy of cross-platform capabilities. The Windows maker’s deep partnership with Samsung meant that many of these features came first, and in some cases exclusively, to the latter’s high-end handsets, much like the support for RCS messages announced yesterday. Now, Your Phone will soon add a cross-device copy and paste option, which will only work if you own one of the 2020 Samsung flagships. </p>
<p> It's been about a week since the last release and another new build of Windows 10 Insider has surfaced, bringing along more goodies for Android and Windows PC users. The newest build — version 18999 — updates the Your Phone desktop app with a new "Calls" feature that allows Android users to make and receive phone calls right from the PC. </p>
<p> Microsoft bringing screen mirroring to Your Phone was a big deal since it was supposed to work irrespective of your phone or PC make, unlike some branded applications. Besides ironing out some bugs, the company now wants to make "Phone screen" compatible with more Windows 10 computers. But its approach pulled a classic one step forward, two steps back, as the feature has dropped support for all phones except for some newer Samsung models. </p>

<p> Windows Insider is an open software testing program run by Microsoft offering pre-release builds of Windows 10 with new features (and bugs). Testers get to be on the bleeding edge, and Microsoft gets bug reports. It's a win-win situation for the most part and quite similar to beta programs run by Google and Samsung. A new build came out this week— version 18995 — and it brings to the table multiple Android-related goodies for Samsung owners. Insiders now have the Link to Windows feature on more devices, a screen mirroring feature called Phone screen, and a new paint job for the Your Phone desktop app. </p>
<p> It has always been the dream to reliably control one's smartphone from a computer — through syncing notifications, texting from the PC, and screen mirroring. Several apps have targetted different aspects of this — Microsoft's Your Phone being one of the more high-profile ones. With the recent v.3.8.4 update, the Your Phone app now supports MMS and using mobile data to sync notifications, photos, and messages. </p>

<p> Camera quality has always been a major differentiating factor when choosing between smartphones, but it seems like the competition has gotten more intense over the last few years. Some manufactures like OnePlus and Huawei use sensors with big megapixel counts to stand out from the crowd, while others like Apple and Google rely more on the marriage between hardware and software. With such a tight race for the winner of the camera crown, we're highlighting three recent YouTube comparisons worth a watch. </p>
<p> YouTube is one of the most widely used apps in the world, so whenever the company makes even a slight change, people notice. The announcement that four playlist-centric features were being killed last month was a bit disheartening, but YouTube's latest move doesn't kill off old features — instead it brings a variety of useful new ones to life, including streamlined player controls and a more accessible captions button. </p>
<p> Zoom has seen incredible growth this year and has become one of the most popular video conferencing platforms around. This success has been aided by regular updates that bring useful new features. The latest Zoom update addresses a major security concern, finally adding support for end-to-end encryption (E2EE). </p>

<p> YouTube Kids has proven to be a popular way for parents to give their children access to a limited collection of YouTube content, even if that collection occasionally includes videos depicting suicide and cannibalism (oops!). The service has slowly been expanding its global reach, and now Google has added 11 more nations to the availability list. </p>
<p> In case you don’t already know, Google syncs all your Play Movies & TV (now Google TV) purchases with YouTube, making the latter a neat way to stream your rentals on the web. On a normal day, you’re able to watch your movies at full resolution (depending on what you paid for) across all your devices, but it seems that YouTube’s been restricting the video quality to 480p on the web since last week — even for HD purchases. </p>
<p> In June, YouTube announced that it was testing simplified video quality settings with some users. We've been looking for an evidence of these settings rolling out for months and couldn't find any until now. They're live for one of our tipsters and come with a much more important feature: default video quality preferences for Wi-Fi and mobile data. </p>
<p> MX Player is one of the most popular apps for playing back media content on Android devices thanks to features like picture-in-picture playback and Chromecasting local files. In the latest beta release, the app is implementing several new additions including pinch-to-zoom and in-app YouTube browsing. </p>
<p> A few years ago, a YouTube update changed the video player's progress bar, extending it over the full width of the display. Ever since, it's been easy to miss the fullscreen button and hit the end of the seek bar just below it instead, often making for a frustrating experience. A YouTube app update tries to remedy that problem by preventing the bar from responding to single taps at all — you now need to hold and slide your finger to seek. </p>
<p> The YouTube Studio app is the latest to reach the 100-million Play Store install milestone. Given that YouTube Studio was built for creators who want to check on their YouTube channels while on the move, it seems that there are a lot of dedicated creators on the platform. </p>

<p> A new phone debut typically means another new JerryRigEverything torture test, and that's indeed the case with the OnePlus 8T. Zack from JerryRigEverything has already taken some picks and blades to OnePlus's latest flagship, and it fares about as well as one would expect. </p>

<p> Forget Update Wednesday! Monday is the new big day. Not only were we treated to the latest M preview release and the official Marshmallow name, but a stream of app updates came rushing out after the sun had set on Mountain View. For many of these apps, little changed aside from a few tweaks and touch-ups to support the next major version of Android. Still, there were improvements to be seen on a couple of updates. YouTube received a couple of mostly unimportant modifications to the interface, but it also contains clues about some things we may see in the future. </p>
<p> A couple of months ago, Google brought 360-degree videos to YouTube. While we're still not seeing a lot of multi-directional content popping up, it has certainly warranted some attention, including a fairly lengthy mention during the Google I/O 2015 Keynote presentation. At the time, we learned that YouTube would be adding VR video support for Cardboard later this summer. In a rare turn of events, Google's claim of "later this summer" actually meant it was one week away – or six days, to be exact. </p>
<p> left: old version, right: new version. Note the cardboard symbol next to the timeline </p>
<p> Now, whenever a 360-degree video begins playing, the overlay screen will show the Cardboard logo just to the right of the track bar shortly before the entire overlay fades out. </p>
<p> What everyone thought was an innocent little experiment from Google during last year's I/O has turned into a full-on Virtual Reality venture from the company. Cardboard, a piece of actual cardboard that you fold and insert your phone in for a make-shift low-cost VR display, has been getting more focus and momentum over the past year with 500 compatible apps and over 1 million viewers sold or given away. That rise culminated with a few announcements at yesterday's I/O keynote. </p>
<p> First, the Cardboard hardware has been redesigned to be simpler to disassemble and put together, as well as work with bigger devices that have screens up to 6" in size. </p>

<p> Yesterday's announcement by Samsung of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 might have seemed like something of an echo of the Motorola XOOM. Well, with LG's recent unveiling of the Optimus Pad at MWC, we can still see some resemblance but with a few alterations making it worthy of further attention. </p>
<p> First up, the Optimus Pad refrains from the somewhat popular 10-inch screen diagonal seen on both Motorola and Samsung's tablets. If you have doubts about the handiness of a 10-inch device, it seems that LG shares your sentiments: the Optimus Tab scales the display back to 8.9 inches, while maintaining a similar 1280x760 WXGA resolution. </p>

<p> YouTube and many other streaming services have lowered their bandwidth utilization to prevent possible network congestion problems due to everyone staying home and using the internet more than usual in these trying times. For many, YouTube videos start playing at 480p or 720p automatically, but it's still possible to manually select a higher resolution. According to XDA Developers, Google has taken a more drastic approach for some regions in India and has started capping streaming quality at 480p for those using the Android or iOS app, with no option to go higher manually. </p>
<p> YouTube's comment sections (and comment sections in general) are typically an unpleasant experience, especially when they're attached to content covering a contentious subject. In what is probably the single best change YouTube's platform will ever see, Google is experimenting with a way of hiding comments in the Android app, moving the peanut gallery's frequently vitriolic and stunningly ignorant keyboard-flailing behind a new button. </p>
<p> Open your eyes wide because a miracle is about to happen. You know how YouTube has long had some comment tools on its website to change the sorting order and like/dislike comments? Well, the Android app doesn't have any of that. What you get is just a regular list of comments with the option to add your opinion to the mix and... nothing else really. </p>
<p> However, that might be about to change. Some users are seeing a new comment interface on the YouTube Android app with the cool features from the website. There's a like and dislike button below each comment, an indicator of how many replies it got, and an option to expand to view said replies in a separate page. </p>

<p> Google Photos only recently got an improved custom share sheet, and Twitter is testing a better implementation of its solution as well. YouTube apparently didn't want to be left out as some people report that they're seeing a new share sheet in the app, too. In contrast to the other two, the video service's solution is a drastic regression in function, making me wonder if it's a bug that passed testing. </p>
<p> YouTube is arguably the world's largest visual platform, and from redesigning the playback UI on Android TV to adding a new button in the bottom navigation bar, the YouTube team is continually looking for ways to improve the interface. The icons used in the Android app haven't seen major changes since the 2017 material refresh, but now it looks like that's about to change — and not necessarily for the better. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/07/31 1:25pm PDTon Jul 31, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/08 2:27am PDTon Sep 8, 2020. </p>
<p> YouTube has started testing two new so-called "experiments" across its various platforms: A new sign-in reminder prompt that may appear on the web and TV devices, and a new search bar on Android that replaces the old search icon. It still looks nothing like search bar Google uses for all its other apps, but YouTube's known for sticking with its own entirely different design choices for no good reason. </p>
<p> Shortly after starting to test an all-in-one record-and-publish function in the YouTube app, its developers have added another experiment that'll be useful for those of us who'd rather only watch videos. They're working on a button that lets you switch voice search languages right on the input screen. If you're multilingual and like using voice search, this will finally make it possible to search for videos that aren't available in the language you've set up in your YouTube app settings. </p>
<p> YouTube is testing a new all-in-one shooting and uploading feature for its creators using the platform's mobile apps. It allows people to record multiple clips right in the YouTube app and upload them as a new video. However, there's a limitation that's odd at first glance: It looks like creators will only be able to record 15-second long clips or takes at a time. </p>
<p> We're all probably guilty of watching YouTube before bed, and it's harder to keep track of the time these days. To help make sure you're able to wake up in time for those at-home morning meetings, YouTube is rolling out new bedtime reminders to let you know when it's time to put the phone down, and the options are smart enough to do things like wait until you're done with your current video, too. </p>
<p> YouTube's comment section has always felt like an afterthought on mobile — you have to scroll all the way past video recommendations to see it. Whether that's good or bad depends on how much value you see in comments, but we can all agree that the current interface is far from great, and YouTube saw fit to change it. The company has announced that it's adding a comment section preview right below a clip's description, expandable by tapping on it. There are also general changes to the watch page, like bigger Up Next thumbnails and the inclusion of community posts along these. </p>
<p> The YouTube app for Android and iOS is getting a small tweak over the next few days. The Trending tab in the app's bottom navigation panel, which showed currently popular (i.e., trending) videos, is changing to show more varied and different types of content, under the new name: Explore. </p>

<p> youtube autoplay </p>
<p> YouTube’s silent autoplay feature—found in the home and subscriptions tabs—isn’t the most intuitive concept Google's ever cooked up. For starters, if a video autoplays for too long while you’re scrolling through your feed, the video gets added to your history, even if you don’t click on it. Then if you decide to watch the video at a later time, it starts right where the autoplay left off, instead of back at the beginning. These quirks alone are enough to make you want to pull the plug on autoplay altogether. Luckily, there is a way to banish it from your YouTube feeds. </p>
<p> YouTube Premium subscribers have been able to preview videos on the app's home screen for months now — videos play silently with captions until you scroll away from them. More people will be able to enjoy the feature soon, though, as the YouTube team has shared that "Autoplay on Home" is coming to non-Premium users over the next few weeks. </p>
<p> YouTube just took a big version jump from v12.49 to v13.01, but you probably won't notice a lot of changes if you're just tapping around. In fact, this update appears to be pretty average for most of YouTube's releases, which usually include a couple tweaks here and there, and sometimes some interesting material for a teardown – and this update has both. You'll find a new page in the Settings screen for autoplay options, and a teardown turns up some inspiring progress on a dark mode and possibly an adjustment to the ad-skipping experience. </p>
<p> On my list of "most annoying things in the world," videos that autoplay upon visiting a website come in at a solid third place. And here lately, it's been an ongoing battle for me and a lot of other users, because YouTube seemingly forsook us and started autoplaying videos all over the web. </p>
<p> Well, that's what we thought, anyway. </p>
<p> Turns out it's not exactly a YouTube issue – it's the Chromecast Chrome extension. If you have it installed, I bet you're seeing the same [annoying] problem. The issue has already been reported to Google and marked as critical, so hopefully a fix is underway. </p>

<p> YouTube channels </p>
<p> The YouTube app is only two years younger than Android itself, but it has always lacked some features compared to the service's website. Among them is the ability to sort a channel's videos and playlists, which you could historically only view by date added. A new A/B test finally gives the app the same sorting options that have been available on the website for a long time. </p>
<p> For the few of you who have a YouTube channel, there was one headache-inducing issue that everyone kept running into: channel URLs could take one of two formats: youtube.com/ChannelName or youtube.com/c/ChannelName (the latter being based on Google+). While this seems like an innocuous annoyance, it used to cause plenty of confusion for viewers who weren't aware of the difference and tried to reach a channel but didn't find it there. Silly. </p>
<p> Now YouTube is consolidating these two URL formats. Either of the two will take you to the YouTube channel, regardless of which format you set up first as a creator. </p>

<p> YouTube is exploding as a streaming platform, but that doesn't always make it easy to know when your favorite channels will be live. You often have to scroll through your front page or subscriptions to see who's currently streaming — never mind who's planning to stream. YouTube is constantly trying out new features to improve the user experience, and its latest test involves a new section in the subscriptions tab, to make it easier to find upcoming live content and Premieres. </p>

To make it easier for you to find out which YouTubers participate in a video, Google is A/B testing a new 'featured in this video' section on Android. In it, you'll find an overview of partaking creators complete with links to their channels and the option to subscribe. </p>

<p> youtube filters </p>
<p> Last year, Google tested a more personal approach for YouTube in the Android app, rolling out a new design with topic filters that helped you trim down recommendations based on content. Following a wider rollout of the feature in the Android app, Google has now decided to expand it to the iOS app, and even YouTube on the web/desktop. Previously it was only available in English, but it will be expanding to French, Portuguese, and Spanish as well. </p>
<p> YouTube has been in the news these days for good, bad, and relatively middling reasons. Putting aside all the controversies, the app is now trying something new that affects its most important element: the Home page. On Android, some users have started seeing topic filters that let them focus their feed on one subject at a time, thus getting rid of all superfluous recommendations and unwanted content. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/youtube-for-android-tv/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549080" filename="youtube-for-android-tv">
<p> The current YouTube app for the big screen — the same one you see on Android TV, Fire TV, other smart TVs, video game consoles, and so on — has a pretty simple interface with just four main menu items (Search, Home, Subscriptions, and Library). A makeover is on the way, however, that will see the interface expanded to include a much longer menu list, which may or may not be an improvement. </p>
<p> Google's quirky side rarely shows up these days, but we're always reminded of the company's more fun and personable nature when we come across an Easter egg in its apps and services. The latest to be pointed out to us is in the YouTube app on Android TV and it's a cute corgi that trots along the seek bar, similar to the one we saw in Hangouts a couple of years ago. </p>
<p> YouTube is one of the most used apps on my Shield TV; it's what my husband and I often go to when we want to catch up on videos from our favorite channels. However, two missing features have always annoyed us about the app on Android TV: one is the lack of playback speed controls, and two is the complete absence of ways to add videos to my Watch Later playlist or other lists. The latter functionality is finally rolling out now. </p>
<p> We live in a perpetual server-side microscopic interface change whirlwind. One day you get used to a new interface, the next another one starts popping up, improving some things, worsening others, and generally making our lives a little miserable in the process. But I can't complain, it's part of the reason I have a job, isn't it? The latest new UI we've spotted affects YouTube on Android TV, and it's not all good news. </p>
<p> YouTube's app for Android TV hasn't seen a lot of updates since it switched over to the web wrapper as an interface. However, each new version usually brings something of some importance. The latest release comes with a couple of notable enhancements, including performance improvements, automatic resume after switching apps, and voice commands via Google Assistant. For some people running Android Oreo, there may also be new "personalized channels" appearing in the homescreen. </p>
<p> Google Classroom first showed up on the Play Store in 2015, as an organization tool for teachers and students. The YouTube for Android TV app is a bit older, as it first showed up in 2014, just one day after the Nexus Player went on sale. Now both apps have passed 10 million installs on the Play Store. </p>
<p> The YouTube for Android TV app was updated to version 2.0 last month, with an all-new interface and changes to the video player. While there are a few great aspects of this update, like the new auto-play screen, many users aren't happy with it. </p>
<p> Holy cow, there's an update to the YouTube for Android TV app! It has been a long time–fourteen months, to be precise–and judging by a major bump to the version number, this isn't just a bug fixer. In fact, it carries an entirely redesigned interface, not to mention a few functional changes, as well. This update probably doesn't address many of the requests users have had over the last year, but it's a great step forward and solves at least one major issue: Auto-play. </p>
<p> Android TV is getting some serious attention this week with updates to just about all of the Google apps, including a few that most of us never hear about. An update to YouTube's set-top variant just came out with a few subtle changes. The latest release fills out the interface a bit to make channel subscriptions slightly easier. There are also some new shortcuts and reorganization for Settings, including a toggle to enable Stats for Nerds mode. And YouTube Red subscribers will finally see a visual change when their subscription status is recognized. </p>
<p> What's New </p>
<p> Home screen – Left: old version. Right: new version. </p>
<p> It looks like Google isn't wasting any time laying down a support infrastructure for its new set-top box push. Just one day after the shiny new Nexus Player officially went on sale, the YouTube app for Android TV has been published in the Play Store to enable easy updates without a firmware upgrade. If you happen to be one of the few people with an ADT-1 developer unit from Google I/O or you got lucky with an early delivery of the Nexus Player, you should see the update automatically. </p>
<p> As far as the actual update is concerned, it doesn't add much: YouTube video recommendations have been added to the homescreen, but based on the screenshots in our own Nexus Player review, they seem to be there already. </p>

<p> youtube for google tv </p>
<p> Last month YouTube for Google TV vanished from the Play Store like a vampire slain by Lincoln himself, quietly fading from public view, seen only by those who had previously downloaded it and already knew of its existence. But like the immortal being that it is, YouTube has risen back from the dead. Not only that, it's stronger, having now received a relatively minor update to version 1.7.5. </p>
<p> In a move that few would have predicted, YouTube for Google TV seems to have been removed from the Play Store. People who have downloaded it previously can still see its entry, but beyond that, it's as good as dead. Further, there appears to be no alternative app to replace it. That doesn't mean there won't be, though. It's possible that the primary YouTube app could be updated with Google TV support in the future, but without a confirmation from Google, all we can do is speculate at this point. </p>

<p> youtube fullscreen </p>
<p> Millions of people watch YouTube videos on their phones nowadays, but despite displays getting larger and larger, we all wish we had a bit more screen estate to enjoy the experience. Switching to fullscreen and landscape helps a lot, but you lose a bit of the YouTube experience. Some actions, like thumbs-up and down, or viewing the channel and subscribing aren't immediately accessible, so you have to get out of the fullscreen mode to do those. Not anymore though. </p>
<p> YouTube 12.40 brought one small but neat change: a pinch-to-zoom gesture that lets you expand the video to fit an entire 18:9 display. Since most videos are made for the 16:9 format, black bars would sit on each side of the display when you're viewing YouTube videos in fullscreen mode, which sort of detracted from the illusion of having that big shiny nearly full-front display. </p>
<p> With 12.40, only the Pixel 2 supported the gesture, leaving other 18:9 smartphones behind. Now we've verified that v12.44 of the YouTube app makes the gesture available to the Galaxy S8+, LG V30, and possibly more devices. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/youtube-gaming/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17560296" filename="youtube-gaming">
<p> youtube gaming </p>
<p> The YouTube Gaming app was officially shuttered at the end of May, and with it... well, not too much was lost. The app itself was basically a heavily skinned alternative to the regular YouTube app, but with a strict focus that limited video suggestions to game-oriented content. While most things were moved to the main YouTube app a while ago, one core feature didn't make it over before YouTube pulled the plug: Screencasting. That oversight has been corrected in the latest update to the YouTube app, so you can livestream your gaming sessions (or whatever else) like before. </p>
<p> Late last year, Google announced that it was shutting down the standalone YouTube Gaming app as it migrated the features to the main application. We had a shutdown date of March of this year, but that Google seems to have missed that mark. Now, the company is saying the app will shut down on May 30, just a few short days away. </p>
<p> YouTube Premium subscribers have started receiving $2 in free Super Chat credits to support their favorite creator during a livestream. The company has confirmed that it is beta testing monthly Super Chat gifts. </p>
<p> If you're just about to leave the comfort of Wi-Fi to risk expensive data fees and dead zones — or, you know, get on a plane for 2 hours — you might plan ahead and download some YouTube videos to kill some time. If you're like most people, you still want to see the highest possible quality, so you might have been disappointed that YouTube caps offline downloads at a measly 720p. That may be changing as it looks like the cap will be rising to a cool 1080p in the future. </p>
<p> Before the days of Twitch, or even Justin.tv, YouTube was the one place we all went for gaming content. Whether they were Let's Plays of games that were out of our reach, guides on how to complete quests or boss battles, or lore videos that dove deep into a game's story, YouTube was the place to find it all. In 2015, the company launched YouTube Gaming to combat the rising popularity of Twitch. It also ended up being a testing ground of sorts for things like a dark theme, Super Chat, and Channel Memberships. But in a weird turn of events, the popularity of the service (according to YouTube, at least) is leading to its shutdown in March 2019. </p>
<p> There's absolutely no shortage of gaming content on YouTube, but for users who crave nothing less than laser-focused dedication to their gaming needs, we've got YouTube Gaming, launched three years back in what was seen as a direct response to the rise of Twitch. While the service has its own app, and own presence on the web, there's understandably a lot of crossover between Gaming and regular YouTube. That connection's only becoming more pronounced this week, as we learn about efforts to synchronize channel subscriptions between the two. </p>
<p> YouTube is a lot of things to a lot of people, but for gamers, it's the ultimate cheat guide to every game, ever. If you can't figure out how Nathan Drake is supposed to get through that tower scene with the snipers or you're stumped over the pattern needed to survive 8 more seconds of Cup Head, you're going straight to YouTube. But depending on the game, you might have to sit through 20 painstaking minutes of slow gameplay to understand a strategy, or you might have to rewatch the same clip a dozen times to spot the timing needed for each move. </p>
<p> The YouTube Gaming app has been flying under the radar for a while as most of the updates have been focused on fixing bugs or making fairly minor changes–there haven't even been any new easter eggs since v1.97. Yesterday's update shows a little bit more activity as both cosmetic and functional changes were made. A revamped app icon and splash screen bring a little freshness to the look, and the always familiar autoplay feature from the core YouTube app is now available so you can put on an endless stream of game reviews or let's plays. </p>
<p> We've been hearing for a while that YouTube was planning to do away with paid content and now it's finally taking effect. It's no longer possible to create paid content, and from December paid channels will no longer be accessible at all. Individual purchased videos will still be available to whoever bought them until 2022, however. Fortunately, for gamers at least, Google is introducing an expanded version of sponsorships for YouTube Gaming, which have been in testing for some time. </p>
<p> An update to YouTube Gaming began rolling out last week, but this one is pretty tiny by most standards. While it surely has the typical bug fixes and performance improvements, the only visible change is a brand new counter above the chat box on live streams. Of course, with the increased version number, there is also a new Easter egg to track down, and the answer is in this post – if you happen to be a collector, that is. As always, if you don't already have the update, there's a download link at the bottom of the post. </p>

<p> YouTube Go </p>
<p> Of all the apps we keep an eye on here at Android Police, YouTube annoys us the most because of its endless stream of server-side tests. We've always wished the app had a beta channel on the Play Store and that those tests would be accomplished through it. Well, at least the first part of that equation is now coming true. </p>
<p> YouTube Go has been in development for over a year and after it went out of beta, it has gathered millions of downloads and expanded to over 130 countries. Now the app has moved up significantly from version 0.71.70 to v1.01.61. </p>
<p> The update keeps the same interface and functionality almost all over the app but brings two new changes. The first and most useful are double-tap to seek controls like the ones the full YouTube added a year ago. Simply double tapping the left side of the video rewinds 10 seconds, whereas double tapping the right side skips forward 10 seconds. </p>
<p> Every week, I examine somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred app updates while looking for changes. The most interesting things turn into APK Teardowns or Download posts. Many of the remaining updates are unremarkable, amounting to a few bug fixes, routine updates to libraries, or even just pixel-level adjustments to layouts and images. However, there are usually a few updates that land somewhere in between. I don't want to spam readers with dozens of short posts, but I hate to ignore things that people might want to know about, so I'm going to wrap up the leftovers for a little weekend reading and call it Update Notes. </p>
<p> Google launched YouTube Go late last year in India, and then it rolled the app out to a dozen or so other nations. Today, it's pushing YouTube Go to most of the world with support for more than 130 countries. No, the US still isn't included, but it wasn't really designed for the developed world. YouTube Go includes features to make the most of a limited mobile data package. </p>
<p> We love celebrating big milestones here on Android Police and the latest is for Google's data-friendly version of YouTube, YouTube Go, which has reached 10 million downloads today. </p>
<p> Earlier this year, Google released 'YouTube Go,' a super-lightweight version of the YouTube app tailored for developing countries. You can download videos in varying qualities, and then send the local copies to nearby friends over Bluetooth. In areas where a working (let alone fast) data connection can be hard to come by, these are welcome features. </p>
<p> Today Google had a huge announcement for Indonesia, in which it detailed six new products for the nation that are arriving now or coming soon, as well as milestones and new initiatives for residents of the country. Among the more exciting announcements are support for the Google Assistant in Bahasa Indonesia, the rollout of Google Stations for expanded WiFi internet access, YouTube Go for the country, Waze support for the capital's odd-even license plate policy, and expansion and milestones for Google's programs in the area. </p>
<p> When YouTube Go was announced last September, the focus was on India and users were asked to sign up to be notified. But then last month YouTube Go made it onto the Play Store unofficially and users around the world were able to download it from APK Mirror and try it out. Some could register their phone numbers and use it fully with the ability to download videos, others couldn't and were limited to streaming. But still, Go wasn't yet officially announced. </p>
<p> Now it is, well at least in beta, and the first official country Go is available in is India. </p>
<p> Even with ever-improving mobile data coverage and an increasing number of WiFi hotspots, it's often still difficult to watch videos anywhere you'd like. This problem is especially prevalent in less-developed countries. Because of this, the YouTube team has created YouTube Go, an app that centers around saving videos to view later. </p>
<p> If you were starting to wonder why Google was suddenly making a lot of India-centric announcements, it turns out that the reason is that Google For India, the company's second official event aimed at the Indian market, was taking place today. </p>
<p> Now, the company has released a more comprehensive list of all the enhancements and features it's bringing to the Indian market. </p>

<p> The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has fundamentally changed how we all do business, take classes, and meet our family members. Many of our streaming apps have had to lower the video quality to spare some bandwidth for the more important stuff. Following Netflix’s lead, YouTube also began capping the video resolution to standard definition on mobile phones. What was supposed to be a temporary restriction for Indian users has now been in place for three months, affecting hundreds of millions, and there's no sign that Google will ease it anytime soon. </p>
<p> Firefox Preview has only received a significant update with version 5.2 with improved tab management and voice search a few days ago, but Mozilla is already working on the next feature-filled update. The unstable Nightly now supports three new add-ons and sees smaller refinements to the three-button overflow menu. The dead-space custom tab bug that's plaguing the current Firefox Preview build is also nowhere to be seen. </p>

<p> Times are a-changin', and so is YouTube's Home on both Android and iOS. It's not quite equivalent to moving houses; more redecorating, giving things a lick of paint where the wallpaper has got a little tatty. </p>
<p> The most noticeable change is videos are getting bigger. Instead of the small, thumbnail-like videos of the past, the video preview now takes up almost the entire width of the screen. This means that fewer videos can now fit in a single scroll - on my Nexus 6P, the old layout could fit six previews, just about, whereas the new design can only fit a measly two. </p>

<p> YouTube is one of the most widely used apps in the world, so whenever the company makes even a slight change, people notice. The announcement that four playlist-centric features were being killed last month was a bit disheartening, but YouTube's latest move doesn't kill off old features — instead it brings a variety of useful new ones to life, including streamlined player controls and a more accessible captions button. </p>
<p> In a blog post today, YouTube detailed recent updates that make video watching easier than ever, along with a few truly new tidbits to boot. The video playback page has been "streamlined" with a more accessible closed captions button (after doing away with community-driven captions) and a switch to toggle autoplay directly from the video controls. (Does anyone actually keep autoplay on?) The company says some buttons are also being re-arranged to simplify the design, and controls are being altered to somehow seem "snappier." ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>
<p> Closed captions are only a tap away now. </p>
<p> YouTube also announced that swiping up on a video will put it into fullscreen mode and swiping down will exit fullscreen. Those gestures supposedly rolled out on the web version earlier this year, but we can't seem to get them working yet — perhaps Google decided to roll the gestures out more broadly starting today. This seems like a small addition that could make a big difference for those who have trouble hitting tiny targets. </p>
<p> The gestures make it much easier to go in and out of fullscreen mode. </p>
<p> Suggested actions are also rolling out that prompt users to do things like rotate their device out of portrait or use VR mode when YouTube detects that it would enhance the experience. The company plans to expand the actions suggested in the future, so it'll be cool to see how this feature evolves over time. Google has been focusing on ambient computing that makes technology more seamless recently, and it looks like this is the latest step down that road. </p>
<p> An (admittedly very basic) smart suggestion in action. </p>
<p> You never know when these new features will start showing up due to Google's love of server-side rollouts, but be sure to download the latest version of the YouTube app from APK Mirror or the Play Store so that you don't miss out. </p>

<p> youtube kids </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/03/11 3:15pm PDTon Mar 11, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/20 9:38am PDTon Oct 20, 2020. </p>
<p> YouTube Kids has proven to be a popular way for parents to give their children access to a limited collection of YouTube content, even if that collection occasionally includes videos depicting suicide and cannibalism (oops!). The service has slowly been expanding its global reach, and now Google has added 11 more nations to the availability list. </p>
<p> The pandemic has forced many of us to stay at home, and in a lot of cases, this also meant working from our abodes. This has been a particularly tough situation for parents, who need to look after their kids while on lockdown. YouTube wants to offer a solution to make things easier for families by adding more than a hundred movies to its Kids collection. </p>
<p> It can take a fair bit of time for a series of major changes to a service everyone's seemingly familiar with to register with constituents. When YouTube announced its beefed-up compliance measures for the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, independent content creators rang the first alarm bells, fearing their videos would be subject to restrictions on their creative voice and revenue. Now, viewers are beginning to complain about the loss of features on their end whether they're trying to keep their kids educated and entertained or if they happen to enjoy some nostalgic puppetry themselves. So, we're taking a comprehensive yet concise look at what's been going on and what might come next. </p>
<p> Google (via YouTube) is rolling out new protections in the coming months for children using the video-streaming platform in the wake of the recent $170 million FTC settlement. As part of that change, personalized ads and comments on children's content will be eliminated, data collection for viewers of children's content will be reduced to the bare minimum required to "support the operation of the service," and content creators will be required to tag children's content as such. </p>
<p> YouTube recently faced some controversy over its autoplay function that ultimately ended up in an FTC investigation. Google's algorithmic selection had a bad habit of leading children away from safe, joyful videos and instead would occasionally point them to violent and inappropriate content. And if that wasn't attracting enough negative attention, it turns out Google also collected personal information on minors and used it for targeted advertising without parental consent, violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). </p>
<p> When it first launched, YouTube Kids had a one size fits all approach for all kids. But since children are interested in different things as they grow up, the service introduced separate content levels last year: Younger (ages 8 and below) and Older (8-12). Now, it's adding a third level specifically for preschoolers (4 and below). Also, the service should launch on the web this week. </p>
<p> YouTube is under fire for several controversies that left the company gasping for air. Most recently, an alarming trend keeps surfacing on the platform: The autoplay function leads kids away from the harmless, joyful content parents have started the watching session with and immerses them in objectionable, violent, and inappropriate videos instead. Now, YouTube is looking into far-reaching changes for kids' content, moving it away from the main platform to live solely on YouTube Kids. </p>
<p> To say that Google's and Amazon's relationship has been going through a rough patch over the past couple of years would be an understatement. The two companies have been on a path of mutual destruction, causing services of one to disappear from devices of the other, and vice versa. It looked like a resolution was nowhere in sight, so you can imagine our surprise when we saw the news that Google and Amazon have finally kissed and made up. </p>
<p> When it comes to watching YouTube Kids you'll need to be in one of the countries officially supported by the app. That's because if you download while in an unsupported nation, the app will disable itself and keep you from watching. Today there's good news for six new countries in Europe who don't have to worry about that anymore, as YouTube Kids has expanded again, bringing the total number of countries covered up to 53. </p>

Not only are there new games, but some new features are also going live, including live streaming to YouTube with support for Crowd Choice. </p>
<p> YouTube is exploding as a streaming platform, but that doesn't always make it easy to know when your favorite channels will be live. You often have to scroll through your front page or subscriptions to see who's currently streaming — never mind who's planning to stream. YouTube is constantly trying out new features to improve the user experience, and its latest test involves a new section in the subscriptions tab, to make it easier to find upcoming live content and Premieres. </p>
<p> Google continues to improve YouTube's livestreaming features after having announced auto-captions and new chat features just last month. Today, Google has revealed that it's refining YouTube Live's streaming process to make it much simpler and quicker for users to get their livestream up and running. </p>
<p> Google announced a smattering of updates to YouTube Live today, the biggest among them being automatically-generated English captions for live videos. Other touch-ups include location tagging for live videos and improvements to the platform’s live chat. </p>
<p> Livestreams are all the rage these days, with some people even making a handsome career out of the business. Nowadays, they're available on virtually every social media platform, and that includes YouTube. Now, YouTube's Android app has added scheduling functionality for livestreams, just in case you don't want to lose track of time. </p>
<p> It's been a busy time for YouTube recently, with the launch of a more material desktop version and a new logo, which also made its way to the Android app. A lot of that was superficial, of course, and the site still functions in pretty much the same way. An increasingly popular feature is live streaming, and Google has just announced some improvements designed to make YouTube Live "faster, easier and more accessible." </p>
<p> Last year, Livestream (yes, there is a company called Livestream) released the Mevo camera, a small device designed for live broadcasting on the go. It was the first camera with integrated Facebook Live streaming, along with support for Livestream's own service (Periscope support came later). Now the beta versions of the iOS and Android apps support streaming straight to YouTube. </p>
<p> YouTube began rolling out with a major new version today, making the leap to v12. You might be expecting some big features when the big number goes up by one, but this update doesn't appear to be packing anything too exceptional. There's a fix for an obnoxious interface issue, but that's about it for changes in the live interface. What's more interesting are a few upcoming items visible through the lens of a teardown. There are hints of a new video preview feature, listings for upcoming ticketed events, and even a few nuggets for the long-awaited Quick Seek and live broadcasting features. </p>
<p> YouTube v11.45 began its rollout to users yesterday. There aren't any obvious changes within the app, but there are a few things to see outside of it if you're running on a device that sees either round launcher icons or app shortcuts. But that's not all there is to check out. A teardown of the APK lends some new details about a couple of previously discussed features coming to YouTube in the future. </p>
<p> Coming as an inevitable surprise to no one, Google has announced today that Hangouts On Air will be leaving Google+ and moving to YouTube Live. All future broadcasts will need to be scheduled in YouTube Live, and events in Google+ will shut down after the hard date of September 12. </p>
<p> Google says that recorded Hangouts On Air will still be available on YouTube, and that Google+ event content will be available in read-only format in the Activity Log. </p>
<p> In regards to Q&A, Google's suggestion to broadcasters is to use Slides, which has the same feature, in conjunction with broadcasts. The company also suggests that questions are gathered ahead of time via social media. </p>

<p> Live streaming is a big topic at the moment, what with Twitter (through Periscope) and Facebook introducing their own mobile solutions to the growing social market. Despite the fact YouTube is the biggest video repository on the web, it didn't have native mobile live streaming - until now. </p>
<p> Of course, YouTube has had live streaming for a while - Google I/O for one has been live streamed on the platform for the last few years. However, moving this platform to mobile is a pretty big leap, as it essentially means anyone will be able to live stream anything. According to YouTube's blog post, to start streaming all you'll have to do is hit a big red button in the app - I assume this will be a fairly prominent button - and you're off. </p>

<p> youtube messages </p>
<p> One of Google's most hidden messaging "clients" is the one built into YouTube. The feature was first privately tested as shared videos in May of 2016, but took more than a whole year to be available to everyone. It was then renamed to Messages and bundled with notifications in YouTube's Activity tab, but remained mobile-only until 2018 when it started showing up on the web. Now, the feature has been officially put on life-support and will be pronounced dead on September 18. </p>
<p> YouTube's built-in Sharing and Messaging system has had a long history: after being privately tested for a many months, it went live in Canada then became official for everyone in August of 2017, and finally was bundled with notifications in the new Activity tab. However, through it all, it has remained a mobile-only feature, available to Android and iOS users. If you were on your desktop, you couldn't share a video with your YouTube contacts easily, see what they sent you, or reply to their messages. That's finally ending now. </p>

<p> When I sit down for a YouTube session, I often think: how cool would it be if I was able to message my friends through YouTube? I don't even have to leave the app/website to do it, and it'd be so much easier if I could message here than on Facebook, Hangouts, or SMS. Awesome! </p>
<p> For some utterly bizarre reason, YouTube is getting in-app messaging. The tab has been appearing on a small number of Android devices over the last 48 hours or so, and Wired published a post explaining the new feature. Apparently, users can get others into the service by inviting them to chat. </p>

<p> YouTube Mix </p>
<p> YouTube Music is due to become Google's only music service by the end of this year. In anticipation of taking the spotlight, the platform has been rapidly adding features and making tweaks lately, such as the ability to swipe between tracks and start playback directly from the album art. Last month, four new Mix playlists were spotted in the wild, and now it looks like those are becoming more widely available. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/20 2:50pm PDTon May 20, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/16 10:55am PDTon Jun 16, 2020. </p>
<p> YouTube Music already has a few Spotify-like dynamic "Mix" playlists, but more might be coming in the future. A new (but, sadly, non-functional) "Focus Mix" playlist has been spotted in the wild, plus a "related" tab loaded with similar artists and other music nestled inside the new pull-out section now-playing interface. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/09 10:53am PDTon Apr 9, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/24 6:55am PDTon Oct 24, 2020. </p>
<p> Google Play Music is on the way out and has already become inaccessible for many. A lot of people have probably long taken advantage of the migration tool and have started using YouTube Music. But there are still some key differences between the two services, and if you haven't made the switch, there are a few things to watch out for. In this article, we're going to dive into the key differences between the two services, large and small, and why they matter. </p>
<p> After years of good times and good tunes, Google Play Music is officially dead. YouTube Music is the new home for Google's streaming aspirations, but it still has a ways to go before reaching feature parity with the departed GPM. Thankfully, the YouTube Music experience on Android Auto is getting a few new upgrades that help to bridge the gap — including more functionality for free users. </p>
<p> We've known for more than a year that Google Play Music's days were numbered. Its death had even been officially announced, but it's now really real. Google has just sunset the GPM app on Android and web, providing the knock-out blow to what has been a rather short match. </p>
<p> Whenever you purchase a new Chromebook, you can access exclusive perks and freebies that make it even more enjoyable to use. There are several unique perks Google offers that you should take advantage of. Right now, you can get six months of Squid Premium for free (depending on your eligibility), which is both an incredible deal and a must-have Android app for a full-time college student like myself. Google recently threw in YouTube Premium with the perks, and it's a freebie you shouldn't hesitate on. </p>
<p> Google has just announced the launch of a YouTube Music app for the Apple Watch. For folks keeping score at home, that means the streaming service all Google Music users are being forced to migrate to has debuted support for Apple's wearable platform before Google's own Wear OS. This makes the company's priorities pretty clear from where we're standing. </p>
<p> Google Play Music is still superior to YouTube Music for people who just want to listen to their own uploaded songs, even if YouTube Music has been catching up a lot lately. But with the demise of the Google Play Music Manager ahead of the full shutdown, users are left without an automated solution for uploading their local library. That's where an open-source tool comes in: The unofficial YTMusicUploader replicates the Music Manager's capabilities and lets you choose a path on your Windows computer for automatic uploading to YTM. </p>
<p> Bit by bit, Google is stripping Play Music (GPM) away from the service's loyal users, gnawing at every feature and integration, and switching it over to YouTube Music. The latest victim is the Assistant integration which lets you play your music on Home, Nest, and third-party speakers and displays. </p>
<p> When Google started selling music back in 2011, it was a pretty big deal. A lot of changes have happened since then, many of them involving branding. Google Play Music is preparing to be shut down as YouTube Music takes over the reigns as Google's default music streaming platform. It looks like another major step in the transition has taken place today: the music store on Google Play is officially gone. </p>
<p> YouTube Music added support for Android TV earlier this summer, but we weren't very impressed. As the approaching death date for Google Play Music draws closer, YouTube Music will soon replace GPM on TVs. Google is taking this opportunity to introduce new improvements to the YTM experience on TVs, including the ability to play uploaded music and get recommendations right from the homescreen. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/youtube-music-key/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17561369" filename="youtube-music-key">
<p> youtube music key </p>
<p> It's clear Google sees a benefit in owning a music service to rival Spotify and Apple Music, but making it happen is proving incredibly difficult. Google Play Music hasn't exactly captured the imagination, in no small part due to its terrible app, and YouTube Red (previously YouTube Music Key) hasn't fared much better. Fear not, another attempt is on its way. </p>
<p> We all know YouTube has been planning to launch a completely ad-free subscription, but the details have been sorely lacking on things like how much it will cost, what will be included, and when it will launch. There may finally be some answers in a report by Recode that points to October 22nd as a probable launch date. The subscription is expected to run for $10 / month and would completely remove all paid advertising from YouTube and include the current benefits of Google Play Music Unlimited. </p>
<p> An update to the YouTube app includes text that describes a product called YouTube Red as the service that enables background playback, a feature that has long been restricted to Music Key (and Music Unlimited) subscribers. </p>
<p> YouTube's Offline Playback feature was first introduced alongside Music Key back in November, finally giving people a way to store a (limited) selection of videos for trips into areas with poor connectivity, or just to avoid using up capped data plans. While it has remained mostly unchanged in the last 8 months, the latest update finally brings a few modifications. The interface is now a bit more informative and uniform, and there's a new low-quality option (which is actually a good thing). A teardown also revealed some big improvements to the voice command interface that has been in the works for a while. </p>
<p> We're naturally big fans of Google here at Android Police. But living in Google's world as we do, it's easy for us to see the flaws in the enormous company, and it's also our duty to point them out. One of the biggest problems with Google is that it's often terrible at providing customer service to its hundreds of millions of active users. So it is with the first major problem to pop up for Music Key, YouTube's new music subscription service. </p>
<p> To put it bluntly, some paying Music Key users can't access the ad-free music, background playback, and the rest of the bonus features that come with the subscription. </p>
<p> Google is always coming up with deals to get people to try its All Access music subscription (which now includes YouTube Music Key as well). After offering free trials when the service first launched or with every Chromecast purchase, it's now discounting a 3-months subscription to a total of $3, i.e. a mere Washington per month. </p>
<p> As the deal's terms state, this offer is only valid for new subscribers, but exactly who qualifies as a "new subscriber" remains up in the air. Obviously, if you're completely new to GPMAA, you will get the deal, but it seems that if you trialled the service for free before, you don't. </p>
<p> As nice as Google Play Music All Access is for music lovers (and it's gotten considerably nicer since essentially being merged with YouTube Music Key), the branding is a bit of a mouthful. We've been sent a series of tips that indicate that Google may shift the name sometime in the future... but don't hold out for something particularly ingenious. According to our tipster, the new name might be "Google Play Music Unlimited," as indicated way back in July of last year. </p>
<p> At least some of the portions of Google's support text refer to "Google Play Music Unlimited," particularly the newer email messages sent to customers. </p>
<p> YouTube has become a great place for indie musicians to get their work out to the public, and in a few cases, even make a little extra money with Google's automated Content ID music identifying and licensing service. That was all well and good, right up to the point where Google decided it would make its video site into a formal music service with YouTube Music Key. We heard of serious issues with the contract terms even before the service launched, but now one independent artist has spilled the beans on those terms, and how they've left her in a conundrum. </p>
<p> The YouTube update on Friday brought a generally well-received redesign, incorporating the Material theme and a whole lot of red. The app didn't just receive a visual refresh, it also gained much needed functionality in the form of search filters. These changes are certainly enough to justify a major version bump, but those weren't the only noteworthy things to turn up in this version. Here's a hint: we can look forward to much more music on our YouTube videos in the future. </p>
<p> Disclaimer: Teardowns are, by their nature, speculative and based on incomplete evidence. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. </p>
<p> We knew that YouTube Music Key would start rolling out this week, and it looks like it's in full force at this point. A bunch of us here at AP already have it, and from the look of our tip box, most of you do as well. If not, well, I'm sorry. Here's a quick look at what you're missing. </p>
<p> As expected, we've got offline playback (you can choose to save the videos in 360p or 720p), background playback, and ad-free music videos. If you have it on mobile, then it's also available on the web, so there's that, too. </p>
<p> At this time, it looks like the rollout is limited to Play Music All Access subscribers, especially considering it just seems to show up for users without any additional signup. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/youtube-notifications/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17550223" filename="youtube-notifications">
<p> youtube notifications </p>
<p> If you have notifications enabled for a certain YouTube channel, you may have noticed the notifications don't provide much info. In fact, they only display the title of the video and what channel it came from (unless you expand the notification). This appears to finally be changing, as some users are seeing notifications with the video thumbnail. </p>
<p> YouTube is one of Google's most server-side test prone apps. Every couple of weeks, sometimes even days, we spot a new layout somewhere that brings a little change to the table. The latest is a renamed 4th bottom tab to Activity. </p>
<p> Activity merges the previous Shared 4th tab (which has been official for all since August) with your Notifications (which until now are hidden under Library -> your profile picture -> Notifications). So there are now 2 top tabs under the 4th bottom tab, yay! The move does make sense though since you can see all your active YouTube shared video discussions with friends as well as catch up on all the recent uploads, live broadcasts, and activity from the channels you follow. </p>
<p> After the launch of Music Key in November, we've had good reason to expect quite a bit from YouTube. We've seen things like 60 fps live streaming, 360-degree videos with cardboard support, and big updates to the Kids and Creator Studio apps – and that's just some of the stuff from the last two months. We also know there's plenty still to come, particularly an ad-free subscription model. The latest update doesn't seem to deliver any new features, not unless Google is planning to flip a switch server-side, but it gives a few hints about what to expect in the future. </p>

<p> According to a report last month from Deadline, the YouTube premium series Cobra Kai would be moving to a different streaming service for its third season. The show, which is produced and distributed by Sony Pictures TV and based on a continuation of the Karate Kid, was said to end up on a rival streaming service like Netflix or Hulu. Today that news has been confirmed, with Netflix picking up the program. </p>
<p> One of the perks of YouTube's paid tier, YouTube Premium, is access to YouTube Originals — scripted programming more similar to traditional TV shows than most of the other content you'd find on YouTube. It seems the streaming platform is changing tack, though, as it's announced that Originals will be available without a subscription by 2020. </p>
<p> One of the major perks of paying for YouTube has been access to its original content. Programs like Cobra Kai or Unicorn Island have brought existing YouTube personalities to the fore in new and interesting ways. That may be changing, though, as YouTube is reportedly axing its high-end original programming. </p>

<p> youtube pip </p>
<p> Last month, Google added video queuing to the YouTube desktop website, which should have rolled out to most people by now. Since the feature relies on the mini player first and foremost, the company has decided to enhance that miniature video preview with proper playback controls and a maximization shortcut. Google has also improved playlist management so you can share playlists more easily and sort your own by date or most popular. </p>
<p> For a while now the YouTube app on both Android and iOS has allowed users to minimize a playing video into a floating window, letting them browse other content without interrupting playback. A similar floating mode is apparently being tested on the web now. </p>
<p> One of Android Oreo's best features is Picture-in-Picture mode for phones and tablets. When you press the home button while playing media (on an app that supports PiP), the video collapses to a floating window that you can move around the screen. YouTube is one of the few apps that support this feature already, but it's only enabled if you pay for YouTube Red. Thankfully, there is a way to force PiP mode for any app that supports it, including YouTube and Google Maps. </p>

<p> YouTube is exploding as a streaming platform, but that doesn't always make it easy to know when your favorite channels will be live. You often have to scroll through your front page or subscriptions to see who's currently streaming — never mind who's planning to stream. YouTube is constantly trying out new features to improve the user experience, and its latest test involves a new section in the subscriptions tab, to make it easier to find upcoming live content and Premieres. </p>
<p> In the later half of last year, we saw the first hint that YouTube may be launching a new subscription tier or service called YouTube Plus. Aside from seeing that particular name spread to the other apps in the YouTube family, there hasn't been anything new about the 'Plus' branding specifically. However, it seems there's yet another name popping up: YouTube Premiere. </p>

<p> youtube premium </p>
<p> Whenever you purchase a new Chromebook, you can access exclusive perks and freebies that make it even more enjoyable to use. There are several unique perks Google offers that you should take advantage of. Right now, you can get six months of Squid Premium for free (depending on your eligibility), which is both an incredible deal and a must-have Android app for a full-time college student like myself. Google recently threw in YouTube Premium with the perks, and it's a freebie you shouldn't hesitate on. </p>
<p> Much like other Google products and services, YouTube has often experimented with features before choosing whether or not to roll them out to the masses. The company already had a portal for accessing unfinished features, at youtube.com/new, but now the hub will only be accessible to YouTube Premium subscribers. </p>
<p> Google's latest smartphones are more affordable than previous Pixel flagships (and most other 5G phones), but the big G is also throwing in some freebies to sweeten the deal. Purchases of the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G will come with three-month subscriptions to several Google services, and buyers in some countries can even snag a free set of Bose headphones. </p>
<p> YouTube is one of the most popular destinations on the web, and like so many sites out there, funds itself by displaying ads to viewers. While you could easily banish them by paying for YouTube Premium (or going all rogue with an ad-blocker), no workaround is quite as weirdly simple as this method discovered by — who else but a Redditor. </p>
<p> Google has been continuously expanding the number of countries and territories where Premium subscriptions for YouTube and YouTube Music are offered. After adding more markets to the list back in March, the services are now available in 14 new locations. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/06 12:38pm PDTon Apr 6, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/30 9:03am PDTon May 30, 2020. </p>
<p> I've been a loyal Spotify user since what feels like the year the service launched, and a premium subscriber since 2014. Spotify premium has tons of great extra features, and I absolutely think it's worth the money if you're considering a paid music streaming subscription. But as I've been spending a lot more time at home of late, I've started watching a lot more YouTube, and the various pre-roll and mid-roll ads were starting to grate on me. Of course, you can remove those ads—by signing up for YouTube Premium. But that would also give me access to YouTube Music, meaning I'd technically be paying for two music services. </p>
<p> A few weeks ago, Google sent out offers for a free Nest Mini to YouTube Premium subscribers, but people looking to redeem the voucher quickly noticed that it wasn't valid. Google backtracked, saying that the promo was a mistake on their end. But it looks like someone at the company simply turned on the UI for the present too early — YouTube and Google Play Music subscribers are now receiving an actually working offer to get a free Nest Mini on the Google Store. </p>
<p> Do you remember how many smartphones you've owned? And do you remember the first phone you've ever used with a subscription service like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Spotify, YouTube Premium, or Google Play Music? While the companies behind these services probably save that information to some server, Google is the only one among them that will rub that knowledge into your face. As long-time users probably know, Play Music comes with a hard 10-device limit that doesn't automatically kick off older devices, instead only allowing four manual deauthorizations every year. If you frequently switch devices (or merely factory reset them), you might have already ended up running into the limit at some point in the past, locking you out of the service you pay good money for. </p>
<p> Google generously handed out Home and Nest Minis to its YouTube Premium subscribers through the last quarter of 2019. The campaign spread outside the US and was well received all over, because who doesn’t like free stuff? YouTube recently started showing a similar promo to some of its paid users, only this time, the redemption process led to a dead end. </p>
<p> We're all looking for ways to pass the time as we stay inside during the COVID-19 pandemic. How about some YouTube? T-Mobile's latest "T-Mobile Tuesday" includes a solid discount on YouTube Premium. That discount is 100%. See? Solid. It's only for two months, but that could still mean plenty of ads you won't have to watch. </p>

<p> youtube recommendations </p>
<p> Last year, Google tested a more personal approach for YouTube in the Android app, rolling out a new design with topic filters that helped you trim down recommendations based on content. Following a wider rollout of the feature in the Android app, Google has now decided to expand it to the iOS app, and even YouTube on the web/desktop. Previously it was only available in English, but it will be expanding to French, Portuguese, and Spanish as well. </p>
<p> If you've never used Google Opinion Rewards, it's an app from Google that periodically sends you surveys and rewards you with Play Store credit. Most questions are usually location-based, asking if you've been to a certain place recently and how you would rate it. But it looks like Google may be using Opinion Rewards to improve YouTube video recommendations. </p>
<p> Earlier today, I received a survey asking about my YouTube history. It's worth noting that if you have YouTube Watch History disabled, you won't get these surveys. </p>
<p> Left: A YouTube survey?! Right: Here it asks about a video I watched earlier today. </p>

<p> youtube red </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/29 2:16pm PDTon May 29, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/22 2:50pm PDTon Jun 22, 2020. </p>
<p> According to a report last month from Deadline, the YouTube premium series Cobra Kai would be moving to a different streaming service for its third season. The show, which is produced and distributed by Sony Pictures TV and based on a continuation of the Karate Kid, was said to end up on a rival streaming service like Netflix or Hulu. Today that news has been confirmed, with Netflix picking up the program. </p>
<p> One of the major perks of paying for YouTube has been access to its original content. Programs like Cobra Kai or Unicorn Island have brought existing YouTube personalities to the fore in new and interesting ways. That may be changing, though, as YouTube is reportedly axing its high-end original programming. </p>
<p> When Android 8.0 Oreo introduced picture-in-picture (PiP) mode, the obvious beneficiary of the new feature was Google's first-party YouTube app. Unfortunately, Google decided at the time that the advantage of nested playback was best locked behind a YouTube Red subscription. Based on recent developments, though, that may be set to change. We've seen several reports that some videos are allowing for PiP playback without a YouTube Red subscription. </p>
<p> The new YouTube clusterfuck was announced about three weeks ago, but not many changes have occurred yet. The YouTube Music app has been updated, but YouTube Red branding still hasn't been switched to YouTube Premium, and the YouTube Music web player still showed "coming soon" for almost everyone. It looks like some of that may be about to change, though. </p>
<p> Google's current services for music and video overlap a bit... to say the least. There's YouTube Red, which gives you ad-free videos and some bonus features. Then you have YouTube Music, which is more oriented towards music videos, and requires a YouTube Red subscription. Google Play Music is purely music-based, and functions as both a streaming service (like Spotify) and a storage location for your vast collection of MP3s. </p>
<p> YouTube may officially hold the crown for different service names, as long as you count the ones that appeared and never seem to launch. When the YouTube Red name first turned up, everybody was rightfully skeptical, but it turned out to be the ultimate replacement for the "Music Key" subscription. In just the last few months, we've seen the names Plus, Premiere, and Remix pop up, but none have yet to evolve into a final name. Yet another name from the thesaurus is joining the list, but this time, it's probably serious. Say hello to YouTube Premium. </p>
<p> Ever since Assistant rolled out, you have been able to ask it to play any YouTube music video you wanted, except you had to say "watch [this video] on YouTube" from your phone, or if you were using a Google Home speaker, you could ask to "play [something] on the tv/chromecast." The "watch," "on YouTube," and, "on tv" distinctions had to be used, because Assistant considered YouTube as a video source (like Netflix) and not a music one (like Play Music). However, many of you go to YouTube as the first (and maybe only) music source and if you're one of these users, you'll be happy to know you can finally tell Assistant to set YouTube as your default music provider. </p>
<p> Of all the streaming music services, I find YouTube Music the most puzzling. This is undoubtedly because I am not a millennial, and by that I mean I am old and irrelevant. YouTube Music clearly doesn't need me to understand its appeal, because its Android app just passed the 50,000,000 installs threshold on the Play Store. </p>
<p> It's clear Google sees a benefit in owning a music service to rival Spotify and Apple Music, but making it happen is proving incredibly difficult. Google Play Music hasn't exactly captured the imagination, in no small part due to its terrible app, and YouTube Red (previously YouTube Music Key) hasn't fared much better. Fear not, another attempt is on its way. </p>
<p> One of Android Oreo's best features is Picture-in-Picture mode for phones and tablets. When you press the home button while playing media (on an app that supports PiP), the video collapses to a floating window that you can move around the screen. YouTube is one of the few apps that support this feature already, but it's only enabled if you pay for YouTube Red. Thankfully, there is a way to force PiP mode for any app that supports it, including YouTube and Google Maps. </p>

<p> youtube shared videos </p>
<p> One of Google's most hidden messaging "clients" is the one built into YouTube. The feature was first privately tested as shared videos in May of 2016, but took more than a whole year to be available to everyone. It was then renamed to Messages and bundled with notifications in YouTube's Activity tab, but remained mobile-only until 2018 when it started showing up on the web. Now, the feature has been officially put on life-support and will be pronounced dead on September 18. </p>
<p> YouTube is one of Google's most server-side test prone apps. Every couple of weeks, sometimes even days, we spot a new layout somewhere that brings a little change to the table. The latest is a renamed 4th bottom tab to Activity. </p>
<p> Activity merges the previous Shared 4th tab (which has been official for all since August) with your Notifications (which until now are hidden under Library -> your profile picture -> Notifications). So there are now 2 top tabs under the 4th bottom tab, yay! The move does make sense though since you can see all your active YouTube shared video discussions with friends as well as catch up on all the recent uploads, live broadcasts, and activity from the channels you follow. </p>

<p> YouTube Studio </p>
<p> The YouTube Studio app is the latest to reach the 100-million Play Store install milestone. Given that YouTube Studio was built for creators who want to check on their YouTube channels while on the move, it seems that there are a lot of dedicated creators on the platform. </p>
<p> YouTube introduced dark mode for its Android app back all the way back in the summer of 2018. The YouTube Studio app, which provides tools for channel management, was left behind. While YouTube Studio added SmartReplies last month, the app remained starkly white — until now. </p>
<p> In a post to its (always fascinating) AI Blog, Google has just revealed that its Smart Reply feature, previously present on apps and services like Messages and Gmail, has come to comment replies for YouTube content creators. Built right into YouTube Studio and with support for both Spanish and English, the feature will make it easier for content creators to churn out generic, low-effort replies to comments. (Like and subscribe, brah.) </p>

<p> youtube test </p>
<p> YouTube is exploding as a streaming platform, but that doesn't always make it easy to know when your favorite channels will be live. You often have to scroll through your front page or subscriptions to see who's currently streaming — never mind who's planning to stream. YouTube is constantly trying out new features to improve the user experience, and its latest test involves a new section in the subscriptions tab, to make it easier to find upcoming live content and Premieres. </p>
<p> YouTube is one of Google's most widely used products, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's resistant to change. Whether it's making the upload experience easier to find or rethinking how many emails need to be sent out, the YouTube team loves to tinker. The latest experiment, spotted in the wild by one of our readers, sees a new design in testing for the video playback screen on Android TV. </p>
<p> Over the last few years, the YouTube creator community has grown closer together and collaborations have become a regular occurrence. To make it easier for you to find out which YouTubers participate in a video, Google is A/B testing a new 'featured in this video' section on Android. In it, you'll find an overview of partaking creators complete with links to their channels and the option to subscribe. </p>

<p> youtube ui </p>
<p> A few small tweaks to the YouTube player UI for Android have caused a few issues of late - digital issues. And by digital, I mean digits, as in fingers. In summary: it's hard to touch stuff right. </p>
<p> You see, the YouTube app for Android has been experimenting with this new player UI for some time now, but as it rolls out to more and more users, some issues are cropping up. Specifically? Well, for one, the progress bar is now a little too responsive given the placement of the "full-screen" button in the portrait UI. The newer YouTube UI places the "full-screen" button directly above the progress bar for the video, whereas previously this button sat to the right of the bar, as below. </p>
<p> Google apparently has a Material Design UI overhaul in the works for YouTube and it looks pretty good. While it has not yet been pushed to the masses, it is apparently being tested on a small group of users while the developers look for bugs and Google braces for any negative feedback (people hate change, remember). Here's a look at the goods and a way to enable the new UI for yourself. </p>
<p> First, let's look at the homepage. Here's the current version: </p>
<p> And the new: </p>
<p> Not exactly a radical difference, but you do see the modern search bar that should be familiar from Google's Android apps and several web services as well. </p>

<p> youtube vr </p>
<p> Hype for VR may have started to die down a bit, but software development applied to the various hardware platforms continues apace, and that includes YouTube VR. Yesterday it announced it would be coming to Samsung's Gear VR headsets this week, and it is also introducing a new way to share VR experiences called "Watch Together," which will allow YouTube VR users to watch and discuss content in a shared virtual space. A handful of new exclusive content will also be coming to the platform. </p>
<p> To prepare for the launch of Daydream, we have seen a slew of apps go live in anticipation for Google's take on VR. Headsets for the new platform should be available starting tomorrow, November 10. Not looking to be left behind, YouTube has made its entry into virtual reality available today. </p>

<p> youtube web </p>
<p> YouTube enabled dark mode on the web right alongside its big Material Design makeover way back in 2017. But the only way to get it working until now was to toggle the dark theme on or off manually. With more and more web browsers adding native support for these color schemes, YouTube is now tapping into the underlying API to give you the ability to match its website with your browser’s theme. </p>
<p> If you have an Android tablet or an iPad, you've likely installed the native YouTube app on them to enjoy your videos. But for those of you who haven't, and for anyone who's browsing YouTube on a touch-enabled Chromebook or PC, you'll be glad to know the website is now better suited for touch interaction. </p>
<p> YouTube is one of the few video services and apps that didn't offer a playback queue until recently. The feature first showed up in testing in August then rolled out to everyone in November, but so far, it's remained limited to the web and may not be very easy to spot. In this tutorial we'll look at how YouTube's new queue system works and discuss some of its advantages and limitations. </p>
<p> Last month, Google added video queuing to the YouTube desktop website, which should have rolled out to most people by now. Since the feature relies on the mini player first and foremost, the company has decided to enhance that miniature video preview with proper playback controls and a maximization shortcut. Google has also improved playlist management so you can share playlists more easily and sort your own by date or most popular. </p>
<p> YouTube's community features began showing up around a couple of years ago but it took a year for the feature to reach more channels and start popping up in users' home feeds on mobile. However, on the web, these posts were not as easily accessible: you had to go to each channel's page to see if it had any community updates. That won't be the case for long though, as posts are starting to show up on the home page for a few users. </p>
<p> YouTube has been testing different ways to help you keep watching videos on the web, while simultaneously letting you browse for more content or see details and comments. Just yesterday, the new Miniplayer PIP view was made official after months of tests, but there was also another miniplayer bar that would collapse the video at the top of the screen and let you scroll down to comments. Now, we're seeing yet another tests that's a little reminiscent of that, but it only affects the fullscreen view. </p>
<p> For a while now the YouTube app on both Android and iOS has allowed users to minimize a playing video into a floating window, letting them browse other content without interrupting playback. A similar floating mode is apparently being tested on the web now. </p>
<p> YouTube's built-in Sharing and Messaging system has had a long history: after being privately tested for a many months, it went live in Canada then became official for everyone in August of 2017, and finally was bundled with notifications in the new Activity tab. However, through it all, it has remained a mobile-only feature, available to Android and iOS users. If you were on your desktop, you couldn't share a video with your YouTube contacts easily, see what they sent you, or reply to their messages. That's finally ending now. </p>
<p> Google apparently has a Material Design UI overhaul in the works for YouTube and it looks pretty good. While it has not yet been pushed to the masses, it is apparently being tested on a small group of users while the developers look for bugs and Google braces for any negative feedback (people hate change, remember).

<p> you wanna see my stuff </p>
<p> I love gadgets. I remember wandering around the electronics store, checking the specs on every portable radio cassette player, and drooling over an Aiwa one that could play both sides of the tape without requiring manual flipping. I was also the 14-year-old girl who went to the computer shop and had a list of every spec she wanted in her first computer. </p>
<p> Now in my (very) late twenties, that passion hasn't subsided. </p>
<p> When it came time to think about writing a “What We Use” post last year, I was still somewhat new to the AP team and I had just learned that I was about to be the new Teardown guy, so I took a pass on attempting to compile my entire toolset in a single article. I can’t say that I’m any more prepared to do one this year, but I couldn’t resist joining in on the fun. </p>
<p> It's my turn to share what items I use to get stuff done each day, but first, I realize that I have yet to formally introduce myself to you guys. Hello, dear readers. My name is Bertel King, Jr., I'm 24 years old, and I consider myself incredibly fortunate. Back in 2012, I graduated from the second oldest college in the US and married the woman whom I dated for all four of my years there. </p>
<p> I can't believe it's already been a year since the last What We Use, but alas, it has. Basically everything has changed in my device collection since last year, so there's a lot to talk about this go around. Before we get into the stuff you're actually here to see, however, l want to point out that we're going to take a slightly different approach to the What We Use series this time. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/ytmusic/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17562263" filename="ytmusic">
<p> Google Play Music is still superior to YouTube Music for people who just want to listen to their own uploaded songs, even if YouTube Music has been catching up a lot lately. But with the demise of the Google Play Music Manager ahead of the full shutdown, users are left without an automated solution for uploading their local library. That's where an open-source tool comes in: The unofficial YTMusicUploader replicates the Music Manager's capabilities and lets you choose a path on your Windows computer for automatic uploading to YTM. </p>
<p> Those of you who pay for YouTube Red may know that for a while it's been possible to listen to music on YouTube Music without a connection with the offline mixtape feature. It's not the ideal solution, as it auto-populates based on your listening history. You can remove songs from it, but many users would prefer to choose which songs go on the list, too. At some point recently, the option to save specific songs to an offline playlist was added to the app, something which we thought you might like to know about. </p>

<p> YU </p>
<p> Since our last LineageOS post, the project has continued to add new features and support new devices. In addition to new Quick Settings tiles and changes to included apps, the ROM now supports 16 additional devices. </p>
<p> Team Win Recovery Project is the de facto standard for Android custom recoveries. While the open-source project often makes its way to disparate Android phones and tablets by the efforts of interested indie ROM developers, the maintainers of the project work tirelessly to bring official builds out as well. Today no less than seven new devices get the official treatment, and most of them are more niche, low-volume hardware that might not get major attention otherwise. </p>
<p> The partnership between Cyanogen Inc and Micromax subsidiary YU has given birth to another smartphone for the Indian market. Unlike past collaborations, this one is undeniably a flagship device. The Yutopia has all the bells and whistles and will retail for INR 24,999, which works out to roughly $377. </p>
<p> Yu's Cyanogen OS-running Yuphoria phone, sold primarily to the Indian market, has had CyanogenMod 12.1 (Android 5.1) available for almost half a year now. The catch is that it's been available as a CyanogenMod nightly build, requiring end users to flash a custom recovery, then a custom ROM in order to access it. Yesterday, the Cyanogen company and Yu itself announced the over-the-air rollout of the finished, consumer-ready update for the stock software build. </p>
<p> The YOG4PAS47N build is Android 5.1.1/Cyanogen OS 12.1 (the official commercial updates from the incorporated company lose the -Mod suffix). To upgrade, users need to be running the latest version of the retail software, YNG1TBS2P2. </p>
<p> Back in the early Gingerbread days, CyanogenMod provided geeks and tinkerers with a way of installing the most up-to-date Android version on virtually any device. It wasn't for everyone, but if you were willing to deal with a few bugs and instability issues, you could easily turn your phone into a quasi-Nexus device running stock-ish Android. Updates are a little slower now that commercial entity Cyanogen Inc. is supporting devices, but two of those phones — the Yureka and Yureka Plus — are being updated to Cyanogen OS 12.1, which is based on Android Lollipop 5.1. </p>
<p> Cyanogen Inc. blew up its partnership with OnePlus last year in order to pursue an exclusive partnership with Micromax under its YU brand in India. YU has released a few devices running Cyanogen OS since then, but the internet had a touch of schadenfreude a few days ago when YU dropped Cyanogen from its Yuphoria phone. However, Cyanogen says everything is still cool. </p>
<p> After launching its first phone in India at the end of last year, Micromax subsidiary Yu is now ready to follow up with the ever-so-slightly upgraded and pricier Yu Yureka Plus. Like last time, this handset ships running the latest version of Cyanogen OS. </p>
<p> What's new? Not much. The phone still comes with a Snapgragon 615 processor and 2GB of RAM. The excitement comes from the higher-resolution 1080p display, up from the previous model's 720p. With the screen still 5.5 inches in size, it amounts to a noticeably high pixel density. Though that may be less of a thrill when you consider that the battery capacity remains the same at 2500mAh. </p>
<p> The Yuphoria is a Cyanogen OS phone in India from Micromax subsidiary Yu. It's a mid-range device that competes with hardware along the lines of the Moto G, but that doesn't mean it's not a decent piece of tech to tinker with. That's especially the case now that the first CyanogenMod nightly has hit the web. </p>
<p> The nightly for the Yuphoria (codename lettuce) provides CyanogenMod 12.1, which itself is based on Android 5.1. The ZIP archive comes in at 365MB. </p>
<p> A nightly has also appeared for the Yu Yureka (codename tomato), a more powerful handset that trades out the Snapdragon 410 for the 615. </p>
<p> Cyanogen Inc's exclusive partner in India, Micromax has a new phone on the way called the Yuphoria. Why the funky spelling? Because it's part of the YU line of devices along with the Yureka. The Yuphoria is launching later this month with respectable mid-range specs and a low price. </p>
<p> Micromax's Yureka phone for the Indian market has been the center of quite a bit of controversy in the more passionate parts of the Android community, thanks to its official build of the CyanogenMod custom ROM. But if you happen to own one, said controversy probably isn't as important to you as the phone's ability to be tinkered with. So if you're ready to try another ROM on the Yureka, here's an official build of the Team Win Recovery Project to enable your tinkering. </p>
<p> TWRP is a custom recovery that facilitates manually flashing new ROMs, root managers, over-the-air updates, or any number of other ZIP packages and modifications, and it can also backup and restore your phone's software with relative ease. </p>

<p> yubico </p>
<p> Yubico is praised as the maker of some of the best physical security keys currently out there, but the company isn't resting on its laurels. Today, it has announced the latest addition to its YubiKey 5 series, the $55 YubiKey 5C NFC. It can be seen as an advanced version of the regular 5C, and it's the company's first key to feature both USB-C and NFC, which might make it its most universal one yet when it comes to phones. </p>
<p> Yubico makes some of the best USB security keys currently available. The company's products make it easy to add hardware-based two-factor authentication to many online accounts, but varying connectors and OS limitations make it harder to use them across platforms. Now Yubico has something closer to the best solution: the YubiKey 5Ci. </p>
<p> Yubico, one of the more well-known names in two-factor hardware security keys, has just revealed its new YubiKey 5 Series: four new keys that all support FIDO2, and a big USB-A model that does NFC. The new keys look almost exactly like their counterparts in the old YubiKey 4 Series, with the same durable designs for both USB-A and USB-C keys. </p>
<p> We're putting USB Type-C connectors on everything these days: phones, tablets, laptops, accessories - you name it. The latest USB-C product on the market comes in the form of the YubiKey 4C Nano, an astonishingly tiny authentication key that retails for $60. If you've got a laptop with a USB-C port and like to have additional security, this is absolutely worth taking a look at. </p>

It can be seen as an advanced version of the regular 5C, and it's the company's first key to feature both USB-C and NFC, which might make it its most universal one yet when it comes to phones. </p>
<p> Yubico makes some of the best USB security keys currently available. The company's products make it easy to add hardware-based two-factor authentication to many online accounts, but varying connectors and OS limitations make it harder to use them across platforms. Now Yubico has something closer to the best solution: the YubiKey 5Ci. </p>
<p> Google Authenticator is one of many two-factor authentication apps available for Android. While Google's attention is more focused on phone login prompts, Authenticator remains a popular choice for having all your 2FA codes for all your accounts in one place. The app has now been updated to v5.0, with a few useful additions in store. </p>
<p> We're putting USB Type-C connectors on everything these days: phones, tablets, laptops, accessories - you name it. The latest USB-C product on the market comes in the form of the YubiKey 4C Nano, an astonishingly tiny authentication key that retails for $60. If you've got a laptop with a USB-C port and like to have additional security, this is absolutely worth taking a look at. </p>

<p> Yubico, one of the more well-known names in two-factor hardware security keys, has just revealed its new YubiKey 5 Series: four new keys that all support FIDO2, and a big USB-A model that does NFC. The new keys look almost exactly like their counterparts in the old YubiKey 4 Series, with the same durable designs for both USB-A and USB-C keys. </p>

<p> As we all know by now, Google's implementation of gesture navigation is pretty lackluster. Given that it still takes up the same amount of space as the regular nav bar, it doesn't have any real benefits and just makes things confusing. You'll probably be disappointed to hear that the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL will ship with gesture navigation, and there won't be an option to use the standard three-button layout that's been part of Android for years. </p>
<p> Android 9 Pie was officially released earlier today, but there was one thing missing from the announcement: the statue. You see, Google creates a statue to put on display at its Mountain View campus for each new Android dessert version. Lately, the statues had been getting pretty stale, though the Oreo one showed some improvement. The statue for Android 9 Pie, however, marks the return to boring bugdroids. </p>
<p> LG's mobile business has been doing some questionable things lately. It all began to go downhill when it released a V30 with slightly better specs as the "V30S ThinQ" for a whopping $929.99 (which it has since lowered by $200). It then updated the existing V30 with "ThinQ" branding as well. The company now seems to be doing the same thing with the G6 for some reason, despite the phone being over a year old. </p>
<p> I normally like covering the Open Betas that OnePlus puts out for its devices. Ever since the program launched last year, it's shown that the "underdog" Chinese manufacturer is cleaning up its act regarding updates (the OP2 incident notwithstanding). However, this time around, I'm left facepalming. Why, you may ask? Aside from the normal bug fixes and optimizations, OnePlus decided to change the boot animation... and I think that it's pretty terrible. </p>
<p> If there's one thing that everyone knows about Sesame Street's Cookie Monster, it's that he loves cookies, namely those of the chocolate chip variety. In fact, it's more of an obsession than a love. You can imagine, then, how important the cookie emoji would be to Cookie Monster on World Chocolate Day. However, Samsung dishonored our furry blue friend by utilizing a cracker emoji instead. </p>

<p> LineageOS is the most popular custom ROM around, boasting support for dozens of popular phones. While most new development in the past year has focused on bringing Android 9 Pie to new devices, Lineage has continued to offer an Oreo ROM for older phones, but that option is sadly going away. </p>
<p> LineageOS is the most popular custom Android ROM, with around two million active installations worldwide. The project recently dropped support for 30 unmaintained phones and tablets, but more devices have now been added in their place. Some of the latest additions and upgrades include the Mi Note 3, Xperia XA2 Ultra, LeEco Le 2, and Xperia Z. </p>
<p> Let the battle of super-high-res phones begin! HTC may have started something with its 440PPI-packing Droid DNA/Butterfly, but it certainly won't be the last to do it; in fact, we've already seen other offerings start to pop up. The newest leak comes to us from Russian site Mobile-Review, and it highlights basically everything you could possibly want to know about Sony's upcoming 1080p flaghship, internally known as the Yuga. </p>
<p> The specs prove that Sony means business with the Yuga, as it's definitely nothing to scoff at: </p>
<p> 5" 1080p display </p>
<p> Quad-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro </p>
<p> 2GB RAM </p>
<p> microUSB, micorHDMI, Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi, NFC, and LTE </p>
<p> microSD card slot with support for up to 128GB cards (!) </p>

<p> Yummly has been, and continues to be, my favorite cookbook and recipe manager app. I love browsing the app for suggestions and ideas, but I also like digging into different ways to prepare a certain dish then combine them all for my own version. Until now, my two biggest complaints were the inability to make personal notes or recipes, as well as the lack of an option to search by ingredients. The second issue has become moot as the app just added a proper pantry manager and search filter. </p>
<p> After seeing Google Assistant Smart Displays from Lenovo, JBL, LG, and Google, it's now time for another big electronics maker to join the fray: KitchenAid. Wait, what? OK, see, there's a simple explanation: KitchenAid is owned by Whirlpool. No, still doesn't make sense. Well, Ryne called the Lenovo Smart Display "the best new kitchen appliance since the dishwasher" and our best guess is KitchenAid read that and thought, " Nah, we can do better." </p>

<p> Yuphoria </p>
<p> Yu's Cyanogen OS-running Yuphoria phone, sold primarily to the Indian market, has had CyanogenMod 12.1 (Android 5.1) available for almost half a year now. The catch is that it's been available as a CyanogenMod nightly build, requiring end users to flash a custom recovery, then a custom ROM in order to access it. Yesterday, the Cyanogen company and Yu itself announced the over-the-air rollout of the finished, consumer-ready update for the stock software build. </p>
<p> The YOG4PAS47N build is Android 5.1.1/Cyanogen OS 12.1 (the official commercial updates from the incorporated company lose the -Mod suffix). To upgrade, users need to be running the latest version of the retail software, YNG1TBS2P2. </p>
<p> The Yuphoria is a Cyanogen OS phone in India from Micromax subsidiary Yu. It's a mid-range device that competes with hardware along the lines of the Moto G, but that doesn't mean it's not a decent piece of tech to tinker with. That's especially the case now that the first CyanogenMod nightly has hit the web. </p>
<p> The nightly for the Yuphoria (codename lettuce) provides CyanogenMod 12.1, which itself is based on Android 5.1. The ZIP archive comes in at 365MB. </p>
<p> A nightly has also appeared for the Yu Yureka (codename tomato), a more powerful handset that trades out the Snapdragon 410 for the 615. </p>
<p> Cyanogen Inc's exclusive partner in India, Micromax has a new phone on the way called the Yuphoria. Why the funky spelling? Because it's part of the YU line of devices along with the Yureka. The Yuphoria is launching later this month with respectable mid-range specs and a low price. </p>

<p> Fans of the community-created CyanogenMod ROM, your cup runneth over with new gadgets to try out on CM 13 (based on Android 6.0 code). Five new phones and a tablet have been given the nightly treatment in the last week or so, to wit: the OnePlus 2, the Moto X Pure (the US multi-carrier variant of the Moto X Style), Yu's low-priced Yureka, the Oppo R5 and R5s, and the original version of Sony's Xperia Tablet Z. They're all available at their respective download locations under CM's somewhat nebulous device codenames. </p>

<p> A nightly has also appeared for the Yu Yureka (codename tomato), a more powerful handset that trades out the Snapdragon 410 for the 615. </p>
<p> Micromax's Yureka phone for the Indian market has been the center of quite a bit of controversy in the more passionate parts of the Android community, thanks to its official build of the CyanogenMod custom ROM. But if you happen to own one, said controversy probably isn't as important to you as the phone's ability to be tinkered with. So if you're ready to try another ROM on the Yureka, here's an official build of the Team Win Recovery Project to enable your tinkering. </p>
<p> TWRP is a custom recovery that facilitates manually flashing new ROMs, root managers, over-the-air updates, or any number of other ZIP packages and modifications, and it can also backup and restore your phone's software with relative ease. </p>
<p> YU, the Micromax sub-brand that has been stirring the news lately thanks to its Indian Cyanogen exclusivity deal and OnePlus One legal action, has just officially launched in India its first smartphone: Yureka, and you could say it has a bit of a God complex. </p>
<p> I'm not sure about YU's marketing strategy because at points they ask yu to play God then they start calling the phone Zeus (are you supposed to play the phone?), confusing the entire deity metaphor. Suffice it to say, as promised there's a divine halo surrounding the Yureka, which if we're being pedantically accurate here is a weird scientifically-rooted expression to attribute to a mythological creature. </p>

<p> Since our last LineageOS post, the project has continued to add new features and support new devices. In addition to new Quick Settings tiles and changes to included apps, the ROM now supports 16 additional devices. </p>
<p> As one of the top custom ROMs, CyanogenMod is constantly adding new devices to its stable. Now it's time for these three devices to have their turn in the spotlight. For the Robin and the dual-SIM Desire 816, this is the first appearance they've made on official CyanogenMod pages. The YU Yuphoria has had CM12.1, based on Lollipop 5.1, for a while, but has now made the leap to CM13 and Marshmallow. Without further ado, here are the three new additions to the CM 13 nightlies: </p>
<p> Nextbit Robin (ether) </p>
<p> HTC Desire 816 (a5dwg) </p>
<p> YU Yuphoria (lettuce) </p>
<p> These are nightlies, so bear in mind that the ROMs will likely be unstable and likely to crash, reboot, fry your phone, eat your dog, etc etc. </p>

<p> Since our last LineageOS post, the project has continued to add new features and support new devices. In addition to new Quick Settings tiles and changes to included apps, the ROM now supports 16 additional devices. </p>

They're all available at their respective download locations under CM's somewhat nebulous device codenames. </p>
<p> Back in the early Gingerbread days, CyanogenMod provided geeks and tinkerers with a way of installing the most up-to-date Android version on virtually any device. It wasn't for everyone, but if you were willing to deal with a few bugs and instability issues, you could easily turn your phone into a quasi-Nexus device running stock-ish Android. Updates are a little slower now that commercial entity Cyanogen Inc. is supporting devices, but two of those phones — the Yureka and Yureka Plus — are being updated to Cyanogen OS 12.1, which is based on Android Lollipop 5.1. </p>
<p> Aside from the OnePlus One, the YU Yureka is the other Cyanogen-running smartphone that you can buy right now. It recently got its 12 S update to Lollipop 5.0 but is now receiving another OTA with a newer version. Just don't get excited thinking it's Android 5.1, we're still on 5.0 here. The build number has jumped from YNG1TAS0W0 to YNG1TAS1K0, which is dated May 1st 2015. </p>
<p> The changelog sent for this update is simple: "This update provides power improvements and security enhancements for your device." Since both improvements and enhancements denote positive things, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and assume that the update is a good one. </p>

<p> If you have a Yureka but haven't been able to get the update over the air, a ZIP file with the firmware can be downloaded here (mirror), though it's quite large - nearly 650MB. </p>

<p> What's new? Not much. The phone still comes with a Snapgragon 615 processor and 2GB of RAM. The excitement comes from the higher-resolution 1080p display, up from the previous model's 720p. With the screen still 5.5 inches in size, it amounts to a noticeably high pixel density. Though that may be less of a thrill when you consider that the battery capacity remains the same at 2500mAh. </p>

<p> z </p>
<p> It's been a good week for real-time strategy fans on Android. Yesterday a new game from the Anomaly developers was released, SPACECOM, and today gamers without access to NVIDIA-branded hardware can play Z: Steel Soldiers. If you don't recall, this Android port came out back in August of last year - about thirteen years after the original was released on the PC. It's a conventional real-time strategy game about robots killin' robots. </p>
<p> Z: Steel Soldiers can now be installed on any Android device running 2.3.3 or higher (or at least any of them that I've owned), so long as you've got $7 to put in the developers' jar. </p>
<p> Sony has announced that the latest version of KitKat is now rolling out to many of its Xperia products with Z in their name. That includes the Z, the ZL, the ZR, and the Tablet Z. For the confused, no, I'm not talking about smearing chocolate all over a Wii U controller. Sony just really likes the final letter of the alphabet, and it's now delivering Android 4.4.4 to four devices all bearing Z in their names. The software version is number 10.5.1.A.0.283. </p>
<p> just in: #android 4.4.4 rolls for #Xperia Z, ZL, ZR & Tablet Z – brings fixes, battery, wifi & email improvements and more #SonyXperia </p>
<p> When the company rolled out Android 4.4.2 to this same set of devices four months ago, more than a few users were left regretting the upgrade. </p>
<p> There are a few surefire ways to get straight to a consumer's heart, and one of them is nostalgia. People love to be reminded of the good old days, and Sony has done just that, uploading a new Xperia Z spot that will take viewers back to the moon mission, the Berlin wall, roller skating on the beach, and playing video games, all with Sony products. </p>
<p> The ad then continues with a young couple joining in a Holi celebration using the Xperia Z, showing that Sony hasn't abandoned its iconic role in capturing or enhancing your most memorable moments. The video finishes by showing that, after running through plumes of colored powder and revelry, you can simply rinse the phone clean – after all, it's waterproof. </p>
<p> It seems that mobile gaming is a haven for all the old classics to reappear. Rising even further from the ashes of the past than most other recent arrivals comes Z Origins, a remake of the RTS from the DOS days simply called "Z" by The Bitmap Brothers. It predates notable fan favorite Command and Conquer from Westwood Studios. Though it did come out roughly four years after Dune II (also from Westwood) which served as the archetype for most RTS games to follow, Z departs from traditional RTS gameplay in that collection of resources and structure construction as a requisite for certain units were not part of the game. </p>
<p> SlashGear has confirmed with HTC today that the Desire HD, Desire Z, and Incredible S (along with the standard Desire) will be receiving the bump to Gingerbread some time in the second quarter of this year. But, there's a potential caveat: US phones might not be included. </p>
<p> It remains unknown if HTC was also referring to carrier-branded versions of the aforementioned devices in its statement, and if it was, if those devices would be receiving updates at the same time as their unlocked, HTC-branded siblings. Phones in this category include the HTC Thunderbolt and Inspire 4G (both based on the Desire HD), as well as T-Mobile's G2, the EVO Shift 4G, and possibly the HTC Merge (all based on the Desire Z). </p>
<p> Yet another picture of the still unannounced EVO Shift 4G has been uncovered, this time with its stylish slider keyboard fully revealed in what looks to be a press-release quality action shot. </p>
<p> The device is likely Sprint's iteration of Verizon's also unannounced HTC Merge. I've got to say, though, that the Shift 4G looks like it received a far better treatment from HTC's design department. The blue brushed-metal around the keyboard looks great, as do the EVO 4G-style capacitive touch buttons. Verizon's space-age aluminum overtones on the Merge, while streamlined, just don't look as cool as the Shift. </p>
<p> Seems like the HTC phones are really taking up the lions share of Android news lately, doesn't it? First the G2 was rooted, and shortly after we learned that HTC did its best to prevent perma-rooting. And just this morning, we heard word that the Desire HD and Z are both being delayed. Quite a mouthful, we know - but now that you're up to speed: an enterprising individual by the name of kholk over at XDA-Devs has come up with a root method for the HTC Desire Z. </p>
<p> The method is very similar to the G2 method mentioned above - the process involves dropping a package on your SD Card and executing a few scripts. </p>
<p> Bad news for our European friends: word from retailers is that the releases of the HTC Desire HD and Desire Z have been delayed until the end of the month. Why? The phones seem to be caught up in Google's testing process: </p>
<p> The relevant bit is in the first paragraph: </p>
<p> Apparently, both units have failed last minute Google TA (Type Approval) testing which is exactly what was said about the original Desire days before release! </p>
<p> Users from all over Europe (and even an Israeli) on XDA-Devs have confirmed the delay, with the revised release dates varying based on location. In every case, though, the dates are in the latter part of the month. </p>
<p> Last night, @IncredibleDoes threw a shout out on Twitter to let the world know that HTCSense.com was now live. </p>
<p> While the selection of users and phones that can utilize the service right now is very (more like extremely) limited, it is still exciting to see this coming to fruition. There are devices both upcoming and already out that are slated to receive the new Sense, and it is nothing short of mind-blowing how much functionality they've added. </p>
<p> If you want to go and check it out, go for it. If you don't have a Desire Z or Desire HD, you won't get very far because even after you register, the site prompts you to sign in from your phone. </p>
<p> Yesterday, Engadget got some hands-on time with the brand new HTC Sense upgrade that will debut on the Desire HD and the Desire Z. It will support all kinds of crazy stuff we've been waiting for like remote wiping, phone location, and backing up to and restoring data from HTCSense.com. Another cool feature is map pre-caching, which means that the phone will have pre-loaded maps on it. </p>
<p> The end result is a much more responsive map experience, allowing you to zoom in and out and pan around with "no waiting". It also means that you don’t need a data connection to get around, a notable foible of the otherwise excellent Google Maps. </p>

<p> Google's ARCore technology is building steam since its initial test launch on Pixel and Galaxy S8 phones. This came with a promise to support more phones, which was followed a few weeks later with a half-dozen more phones added during MWC. To keep the momentum going, Google also featured nearly 90 new apps and games that made use of ARCore in some way. Now with the latest update, we can likely guess at the next phones on the list. </p>
<p> It only took about a month for Motorola to release the Moto Z2 Force's kernel source code after it launched in August. As you may know, OEMs are required to publish their modifications to the Android kernel code, which is then used by developers to make custom ROMs and recoveries. </p>
<p> Motorola announced which phones would receive Android 8.0 back in August. The Verizon Z2 Force was first to get the update, but now it looks like the T-Mobile model is up next. A few Z2 Force owners on T-Mobile have received the Oreo update notification, indicating that a mass rollout may start soon (if it hasn't already). </p>
<p> 5G is still a year or two away, and even then, hardly any phones will support the technology. Many networks have yet to saturate the existing LTE wireless standard, but Verizon (among other carriers) has been working toward that goal in some areas. Verizon has started pushing an update to the Moto Z2 Force, giving it support for the carrier's upcoming 'Gigabit Class LTE' service. </p>
<p> Lenovo's latest Moto flagship has been through the mill a bit recently. The problems with the Z2 Force's shatterproof but easily scratchable plastic-covered screen have been well documented, and the smaller battery is one of a number of other disappointments when compared to its predecessor. Its price was seemingly slashed by $80 before it was even released (although Moto denies this), and David has even concluded that the Z line and its mods add up to little more than a thinly veiled money grabbing exercise. Moto could use some good news then, and luckily YouTube phone torturer Zack Nelson (JerryRigEverything) was left impressed with the Z2 Force. </p>

<p> z4v </p>
<p> Remember the Verizon Z4v? Me neither [almost]! I even wrote an article about this phone like 2 weeks ago and I still barely remember it. If you want a refresher: the Z4v was basically a Verizon-ified version of the Xperia Z4. Which launched way back in April. There's also that whole "the Z5 now exists" thing, which makes releasing a new Z4 variant kind of pointless and generally a bit silly. </p>
<p> Verizon, in what can only be called a mildly astonishing moment of self-realization and pragmatism, has therefore decided to cancel the phone. Take it away, Albert: </p>
<p> Verizon will no longer be launching Xperia Z4v, however we are committed to supporting Sony Mobile’s product portfolio and will support existing products. </p>
<p> Remember that time Verizon announced it will carry a version of the Xperia Z4 called the Xperia Z4v three months ago? And said it would be out "this summer?" Well, summer ends in exactly... tomorrow, and the phone still isn't out. It was actually allegedly supposed to be released over a month ago, but now any kind of launch before October seems highly unlikely. Some guy got one anyway (somehow) and reviewed it in this video on YouTube. Verizon's site, by the way, says the phone is still "coming soon." </p>
<p> As I hope we can all agree, this is tremendously, mind-bendingly dumb for several reasons. </p>

<p> Z5 </p>
<p> Lenovo's Chinese phone releases are not usually big international news, but this time was different. The company's teasers seemed to promise an all-screen design without a notch. That would certainly be refreshing in this day and age. However, the Z5 has been announced, and it looks like every other phone unveiled in the last six months. There's a notch, a glass back, and a chin. </p>
<p> The Sony Z5 currently reigns as the king of smartphone camera quality according to DxOMark. I've had the opportunity to use a review unit as my daily driver for the past week, and I have been pretty impressed with the image quality thus far. </p>
<p> One thing that I hadn't liked, at all, was that Sony was still using the same clunky camera app that debuted with the original Sony Z. Seriously, five generations of devices all using the same cumbersome UI? </p>
<p> That changes today. The Japanese phone manufacturer has begun the roll-out of the major camera app update that they previewed back at IFA. </p>

<p> The dbrand website has been infected! No, we're not talking about the currently-raging global pandemic. We're not talking about a computer virus that will hijack your bank account, either... but that one's not far off. dbrand's limited edition Teardown skins are back and as infectious as ever. There's no known cure: you can only hope your wallet will be strong enough to survive the onslaught. </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip was billed as the first folding phone with a glass display, but thanks to a "protective layer," the top-most surface you actually interact with is only as durable as a plastic screen protector. In a testing video published earlier today, Zack Nelson of JerryRigEverything showed off how easily the phone's display scratches, in the end, literally poking holes in it. </p>
<p> Whether he's attempting to destroy an expensive phone or turning one into something even more beautiful by making it transparent, JerryRigEverything's (real name, Zack) videos are essential viewing. The latest phone whose durability he tests is the Razer Phone 2 — which we reviewed here — let's see how it gets on. </p>

<p> zagat </p>
<p> Google bought Zagat about seven years ago, but it let the company go earlier this year after basically ignoring it. Such sales often involve purchasers that only want a company's brand, but Zagat appears to be chugging along. There's even a newly refurbished Android app today. </p>
<p> It was reported earlier this year by Reuters that Google may have been looking to sell Zagat—the restaurant reviews guide/service it picked up for $151 million in 2011, if you're unfamiliar. Those unofficial plans appear to have panned out. The Infatuation, a new restaurant guides and reviews company, has just announced that it's acquiring the Zagat brand from Google. </p>
<p> Update Wednesday has come and gone, but most of what we've seen can be described as bug fixes and relatively minor adjustments – not that we aren't happy with improvements of any kind. Google just set loose Maps 9.6, and like most of the other apps, the changes are mostly about fine-tuning. This version slightly improves the visibility of Zagat reviews and adds an option to determine if the voice should play over speakers or Bluetooth during turn-by-navigation. </p>
<p> What's New </p>
<p> It's a few days late, but Google just posted a changelog for the latest release of Maps. </p>
<p> Google made some sweeping changes after it acquired restaurant review indexer Zagat, including limiting the cities in which it would work. The app itself was updated a few times, but it's been sitting neglected for a year until today. Zagat is going material in this update, but there are a few functionality tweaks too. </p>
<p> Google Maps is one of those apps that will always have an enormous number of potential new features, so it's interesting to see the things Google is focusing on with each new release. We just saw an update to v9.2 with new navigation settings and auto-correct for searches, but there are plenty of other really interesting additions in the works. Let's take a look at some of the features we might have to look forward to. It's time for a teardown. </p>
<p> Disclaimer: Teardowns are, by their nature, speculative and based on incomplete evidence. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. </p>
<p> People didn't always hate Zagat, but Google's new vision for the iconic restaurant review guide has not been widely accepted. The service became free, but Google also revamped it and limited the number of cities it tracked. The new update makes some tweaks to the app and expands the supported cities, but it's probably not going to do much to improve the app's 2.4 star rating. </p>
<p> Update: Zagat claims the number of cities available will be expanded to 50 over "the coming months," and that old restaurant reviews will be made available on the web page "soon." Woohoo, a whole 50, guys! </p>
<p> Ever have your parents pull the old 'bait and switch' on you when you were a kid? "Hey Jimmy, here's a brand-new bike. And by the way, your mom and I are getting divorced!" Well, Google pretty much just tried doing basically that to Zagat fans. You see, the Zagat app and website got a total overhaul today. They look pretty nice - everything's all card-y. </p>
<p> Sure, Google may have acquired Zagat and used the company's renowned ratings engine to start powering its data on everything from electronics stores to car washes. However, the review site got its start in restaurants way back in the day, and even after the purchase, continues to provide helpful information on every aspect of your food consumption outings. So, why not give the service its own app? Well, that's just what everyone's favorite search giant did! </p>
<p> Zagat is predictably gorgeous. With Google Maps built in, it's convenient to find a restaurant near you, check its ratings, and even get photos of the place where available. </p>
<p> So Google Maps hit version 6.8 yesterday, bringing with it the crazy Zagat/Google+ mashup that was detailed earlier. The "What's New" section in the Play Store lists "See reviews from experts and people you know," "Find just the right places with Zagat scores and summaries," "Get directions directly from map bubbles," but they left out the most interesting new change: "Unreleased feature assets buried in the APK." </p>
<p> Timeline </p>
<p> For starters, we've got some brand new image files. Check these out: </p>
<p> So there's a bunch of fresh files, all called "timeline_something." The XML stretches "timeline_line_mid" vertically, so it clearly connects them. </p>

<p> Everyone was all hyped up about sapphire crystal displays a few years ago, then manufacturers realized what a complete pain in the butt it was to manufacture synthetic sapphire at an industrial scale. There have been a few phones and watches with this super hard material covering the screen, but Zagg offers a "Sapphire Defense" screen protector, too. That makes it sound like a sapphire glass screen protector, and the high price backs that assumption up. However, JerryRigEverything just posted a video revealing it to be nothing more than treated plastic. </p>
<p> It's no secret that I love tablets - I find them to be incredibly useful and fun tools. In fact, I've spent a lot of time as of late reviewing and comparing the most recent additions to the tablet world to one another. As much as I love tablets, though, they're not the best for productivity without some good accessories. Of those accessories, the most useful addition is, without a doubt, a Bluetooth keyboard; truth be told, I actually prefer a good Bluetooth keyboard and stand over the Transformer Series' keyboard dock in most cases - it's just a more portable and convenient option for me. </p>
<p> The stakes for the ZAGGsparq 2.0 aren't low -- after all, the 6000mAh charger won not one, but two innovation awards at CES 2010, and its claim to charge a smartphone up to four times is downright stunning. But underneath the shiny black exterior and all the fancy marketing prose, is it really all that? Well, not quite... </p>
<p> At A Glance </p>
<p> The ZAGGsparq 2.0 features: </p>
<p> 6000mAh of juice </p>
<p> Dual charging ports -- one labeled "general," and the other "optimized" </p>
<p> Compatibility with both phones and tablets </p>
<p> The Good </p>
<p> 6000mAh – It’s not the most powerful or juice-filled portable battery we’ve come across, but with 6000mAh under its hood, the ZAGGsparq 2.0 still isn’t anything to scoff at… at least not on paper. </p>

<p> Earlier today, I reviewed the ZAGGkeys Flex Bluetooth keyboard, and loved it. It's a fantastic little keyboard - ultraportable, has incredibly battery life, and is a pleasure to type one. Not only that, but it can easily pair with your Android tablet or smartphone, as well as any iOS device that you may have. Say what you will about iOS, but the ability to have one keyboard that can pair with both Android and iOS is just awesome. </p>

<p> zappos </p>
<p> Need new shoes in a hurry? Today Zappos updated its Android app to version 3.0, ushering in a host of new features. You can now color code and nickname your credit cards, a big plus for those of who you need shoes so quickly you couldn't possibly be expected to stop and compare card numbers. Additional changes to the various payment screens allow for a more pleasant checkout experience overall. </p>
<p> Love to shop? Love to shop on the go? Love to shop while shopping? If you answered yes to any of those questions (especially the last one) then you need to grab the new app from online retailer Zappos. It offers all of the Zappos deals that you've grown to love, but it also has the features that you would expect from a good shopping app. Of course you can search and buy, but it also has product reviews, a sharing feature that works over bluetooth, and a wishlist style feature. </p>

<p> Identity theft via hacking or social engineering is a common problem these days, and the results can quickly spiral out of control, locking you out of the accounts you depend on permanently, as in the case of today's horror story.

<p> Another week, another potentially serious data breach. The emails, phone numbers, and locations of 31 million users of Android keyboard app Ai.type have been compromised after the developer failed to secure the server on which the information was stored. Some 577 gigabytes of data is said to have been exposed, representing more than three quarters of the app's total userbase. </p>

<p> Most people know the Moment name for its interchangeable smartphone camera lenses or some great looking cases, but last year the company also launched a new camera app designed to present manual controls in an intuitive interface. A major update is rolling out now that adds several new and enhanced features, including a few you wouldn't find very often outside of dedicated camera hardware. To celebrate, Moment is also running a sale for app buyers of 15% off everything in their shop. </p>
<p> Given the amount of devices that run on Android, it's no surprise that Google is always busy updating its ARCore support list. This week, the main additions consist of the Moto One, and Moto One Power, as well as four "Touch Computers" from a company called Zebra also joining the club. The Nokia 8.1, which was removed from the list at some point, has now returned. </p>
<p> Back in Feburary, Google announced the 'Android Enterprise Recommended' program. It's designed to make buying Android phones for business use easier, by only recommending models that comply with a handful of requirements (Android 7.0 or higher, security update for three years, etc). Now the company is expanding the Enterprise Recommended program to rugged devices. </p>
<p> If you've spent any amount of time in one of Target's 1,800 US stores, it's likely you've seen an employee using a dressed-up iPod Touch to look up stock info. It's been that way since 2014, but the retailer is now switching to Android for all its essential sales floor activities. These aren't any devices you've ever seen, though. Target is using an enterprise-oriented Zebra TC51. </p>

<p> zeebox </p>
<p> Remember Zeebox? You know, the NBC and Comcast-backed app that promised to bridge the gap between television and social media? You could be forgiven for forgetting - the app warranted exactly one post from us 18 months ago, and hasn't made any significant changes to get back on our radar. Today the app has been re-branded as "Beamly," a move announced with a swanky app redesign. </p>
<p> All the core functions of Zeebox seem to have made it over to the new Beamly app: the basis of the experience is still the TV schedule, which will learn your tastes and recommend new shows. </p>
<p> Zeebox, a social TV companion app that's already found popularity in the UK has officially hit the US, aiming to make a splash thanks to monetary and promotional backing from both NBC and Comcast. </p>
<p> Essentially, Zeebox serves as an auxiliary guide to TV enjoyment as well as a social platform where users can see which shows are hot, who's watching them, and what they're saying in response. Users can see what their friends (and everyone else) are viewing or planning to view, chat with friends, start a viewing party, or tweet reactions. </p>

<p> Zeemote </p>
<p> The Zeemote is a plucky little device that keeps popping up around these parts. Normally $30, the Bluetooth controller pairs with any Android device to give physical controls to games that would otherwise be touchscreen-only. We gave away a thousand of them, and when I reviewed the little guy, I said it would be great, if it were just a bit cheaper. Well, for this weekend, it is. Use coupon code "JS1MDE12" (no quotes), and the company will knock 50% off the controller, bringing it down to a much more palatable $15. </p>
<p> By now, you should've heard about the Zeemote Bluetooth Gaming Controller. We only gave away a thousand of them a couple weeks ago, after all. We've started to receive ours here at the Android Police Station, so we thought it was an appropriate time to take a look at the device (as well as provide you with some games to cut your teeth on). </p>
<p> The Hardware </p>
<p> It would not be wrong to make a comparison to the Wii nunchuk attachment. </p>
<p> So, you and 999 of your closest internet friends just received a free Zeemote in the mail. Now you're all sitting around in your respective houses wondering what to use your new toy on. You can't ask each other because you all live in different places. Well, since we got you into this mess, we'll help get you out. Here are seven of the best Zeemote-enabled games available. </p>
<p> Running Fred </p>
<p> Perhaps one of the best games on this list, Running Fred is a game we've featured before. </p>
<p> Update: That's it, guys - all 1,000 Zeemotes are gone. Congrats to all who got one! </p>
<p> Yes, you read that right. We're giving away 1,000 Zeemote Bluetooth Gaming Controllers. One thousand. If you were to buy all of those from Amazon, it would cost you a whopping $30,000. Yeah - kick back and chew on that for a few. </p>
<p> So, what's a Zeemote? It's a controller that aims to drastically improve gaming on mobile devices, because, let's face it - touchscreen controls generally suck. </p>
<p> This contest is now over. We have selected the winners - see if you are one of them towards the bottom of the page. </p>
<p> Guess what time it is! That's right, it's time for another giveaway, and this time we've partnered up with HyperBees to give away 3 Zeemote Bluetooth gaming controllers (~$30 value each), all for downloading and trying out the free version of their very popular Speedx 3D. The game has been out for a while in paid-only form, but this week Hyperbees released a free ad-supported version, which they are now trying to promote. </p>

<p> Zeiss may partner with Nokia now, but the photography company still makes standalone cameras of its own. The Android-powered ZX1 was first announced back in 2018, but it failed to meet its early 2019 launch date. Now it looks like the camera is actually coming soon — and it's got an eye-boggling price tag to boot. </p>
<p> Out of all the Android phones HMD Global has released under its Nokia brand license in the past few years, the Nokia 7.1 seems to have made the best impression in certain western markets like the United States. We're now coming close to a year since its announcement and there's a swell of excitement for an update. Fortunately, we do have some tacit confirmation that the Nokia 7.2 is a thing, thanks to optics supplier ZEISS. </p>
<p> Yesterday in China, HMD Global announced the newest member of its range of Nokia branded Android smartphones. We've seen the wallet-friendly Nokia 3 and 5, the mid-range Nokia 6, and most recently came the flagship Nokia 8. While it might appear that HMD doesn't know how to count, the Nokia 7 announcement at least takes us one step closer to a full house. The Nokia 2 and 9 are on the way soon, too. </p>
<p> The Nokia 7 follows the same pleasing design language as its siblings, but where the Nokia 8 was encased in metal, this new phone goes for a mixture, with an aluminum frame and a vacuum molded back made from Corning Gorilla Glass which curves nicely around the back. </p>
<p> VR doesn't seem to be as exciting these days. Whether it's the limitations of mobile VR (like heat, video quality, and battery drain) or being tethered to your PC with the Rift or Vive, VR doesn't seem that appealing to many people — I, for one, am not one of those, but I digress. To combat some of the weaknesses of both platforms, Zeiss has come up with the VR One Connect, which bridges the gap between mobile and PC virtual reality... in theory. </p>
<p> So far, HMD Global has released three Nokia-branded Android phones - the Nokia 6, 5, and 3. But the most-expensive model, the Nokia 6, still had a mid-range Snapdragon 430 processor. With HMD/Nokia's clean Android ROM and competitive pricing, many hoped for a true flagship model to be released. Now the time has come, as HMD has taken the wraps off the Nokia 8. </p>
<p> HMD Global, maker of the new Android-based Nokia phones, is trying its best to recreate the classic Nokia phone formula. The Nokia 6 is very durable (especially for a phone in its price range), much like some Nokia phones of old. Now, HMD is partnering with Zeiss to improve the cameras on future Nokia phones. </p>

<p> Judging by the number of views on every AP article about Mario or Pokemon, it's easy to tell that there are a TON of Nintendo fans amongst AP's readership. It's also a safe bet that a lot of you own a Nintendo Switch. </p>
<p> One of the best things about the Switch is that it's the first truly go-anywhere console. You can toss it in your backpack, gym bag, or even your sweatpants pocket and take it with you wherever you go. The only downside is that beyond the safe confines of your home, there are lots of things that can scratch up the finish of your beautiful device. </p>
<p> The Nvidia Shield TV is unquestionably the best Android TV box you can buy right now, especially if you're looking to do some gaming. Earlier today, Nvidia announced that the Shield is coming to China, but the selection of games is particularly interesting. At the launch event, the company revealed that the Shield would offer remastered Nintendo games from the Wii and GameCube eras. </p>
<p> The Legend of Zelda has inspired a lot of games over the years, and why not: it's the quintessential fantasy action-adventure. Nintendo literally sells millions of dollars worth of hardware each time they release a new one. And while a full Android release for the storied franchise is but a pipedream at the moment (especially with the way Nintendo seems to be cuddling up to Apple as of late), indie developer Cornfox & Bros. is more than willing to pick up the slack with Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas. </p>
<p> Green Arrow is a mamma's boy. Hawkeye is overrated. Katniss is a pushover. All of those archer-themed heroes should try saving the world with just one arrow - maybe then they'd approach the sheer brass-balled awesomeness of the protagonist in Titan Souls. As he wanders in a twilight world between the living and the dead, he slays gigantic monsters with a single hit from his arrow... though he does get a little help, since it's magical and he can easily retrieve it after every shot. </p>
<p> Update: the developers released another quick update on September 19th, explicitly supporting the MOGA family of controllers. The NES30 mentioned below, a generic Bluetooth HID controller, is also working. Well done, Noodlecake and RocketCat! </p>
<p> -- </p>
<p> I've been playing the heck out of Noodlecake and RocketCat's Wayward Souls RPG-roguelike ever since it landed on Android. While the top-down action game does have some excellent touchscreen controls, there's just no substitute for a real gamepad. That being the case, the developers have issued an update that adds controller support. Now you can slash, stab, and zap your enemies with clicky abandon, until they inevitably surround and kill you on the second floor. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a shameless Zelda clone, a mix of god games and Minecraft, an adorable adventure game starring bloodthirsty monster, and an endless runner-gunner. Without further ado: </p>
<p> Ittle Dew </p>
<p> I'll give you three guesses as to what mega gaming franchise Ittle Dew is riffing on, but you're only going to need one. </p>
<p> From the gameplay trailer, League of Heroes might almost look like Baby's First Diablo. In the village of Frognest, you star as a hero of the story, hacking and slashing through a variety of magical bad guys to save your town. The graphics are beautifully stylized in a 2D cartoon aesthetic. The game is free to play and includes over 60 quests. </p>

<p> Genshin Impact is a free-to-play RPG that has been frequently compared to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, thanks to a similar cell-shaded art style. As you would expect, many gamers have been eagerly anticipating the release of Genshin Impact, and now that it's here, it would seem the wait was actually worth it. Sure, this is a free-to-play release. It's also a gacha game. So all of the typical underpinnings of F2P titles are here. Thankfully genuine care was taken to craft an enjoyable game that doesn't teeter too far into pay-to-win territory, resulting in a game that's not only worth playing but elevates the F2P field by setting a high benchmark that's going to be tough to beat. </p>
<p> It's no coincidence that Genshin Impact looks a heck of a lot like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, thanks to its colorful graphics and open-world design. Of course, this parallel is easy to draw when the developer miHo Yo utilizes screenshots that were clearly inspired by Breath of the Wild, and so the hype for this title has been building. Luckily miHo Yo has just announced that Genshin Impact will arrive on Android, iOS, and PC on September 28th, and even better, you can pre-register on the Play Store starting today. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/18 9:35am PDTon Apr 18, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/29 10:12am PDTon Jul 29, 2020. </p>
<p> Paying and getting paid is easier than ever, but the various apps you can choose to transact with have their upsides and downsides. Picking one can be difficult, and signing up for all of them even more so — especially when it often means convincing friends and family to do so as well. But old school bank ACH transfer tools are for the birds, and cold, hard cash remains a dicey proposition in the current environment. Splitting the bill with cash is also just a pain, and newer peer to peer (P2P) payment apps are so much more convenient that it's truly silly in 2020 not to be using one. </p>
<p> Various US banks added support for money transfers via Zelle over the last few months, but support is far from universal. Zelle is now available to just about anyone in the US with its new mobile app. If you've got a debit card, odds are you can use Zelle to send money. </p>
<p> Another day, another Venmo competitor. This time we might actually have something worth looking at, though. Zelle — a payment network developed by Early Warning and built on top of ClearXchange — has been announced with integrated support for many different banks and their respective applications, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, US Bank, CitiBank, and Chase (among a huge list of others). These days everyone seems to think they can edge out Venmo, but with bank integration, Zelle might actually be able to do it. </p>
<p> The Bank of America Android app had its material overhaul last year, so it already looks better than a ton of banking apps. However, today it's getting better, with the new ability to send, receive, or request money from almost anyone in your contacts. </p>
<p> Left: before. Right: after. </p>
<p> Previously, money could be sent, but it did not use your phone's address book, and requesting money was difficult. The new feature, however, uses your phone's address book to get emails of the person you want to send money to, or request money from. Sending money is pretty the same as before, or any other service, with the addition of it being able to use anyone of your contact list. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/zenfone/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17563069" filename="zenfone">
<p> Asus released its first Android 11 beta build last week — not for the latest ZenFone 7 line but yesteryear’s ZenFone 6. It’s not typical for companies to treat their older models with latest Android updates before their current flagships, but nothing seems to be going straight in 2020, so what the heck. The ZenFone 7 and 7 Pro are at last catching up with their predecessor as they’re now getting their own Android 11 beta program, which you can sign up for right away. </p>
<p> ASUS’s big flagship launch for the year is just around the corner. But two days before the company will officially take the wraps off its ZenFone 7 series, a couple of leaks have popped up to reveal what at least one of the upcoming models is going to look like. That nifty flip-up camera from last year’s ZenFone 6 looks set to make an appearance once again to give the phone a clean, notch-less front. </p>
<p> ASUS has been improving on its ZenFones with every generation, which means we have high hopes for the ZenFone 7 line. A YouTube live stream event for the ZenFone 7 launch has just been listed for August 26th, less than two weeks away. </p>
<p> Android 10 beta testing for ASUS’ last two flagships — the ZenFone 6 and the ZenFone 5Z — is already underway since August, though only for a small, closed group. The early ZenUI version for the 5Z reportedly came laden with a long list of bugs that essentially held off its public release for a while. ASUS appears to have addressed many of those flaws, and is now making the ZenUI 6 open beta available to a wider userbase of its 2018 flagship. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 6 marks the beginning of a new era for ASUS, as the company switched to an AOSP-inspired ROM for the phone — plus, it's generally a surprisingly good phone at a decent price with an interesting take on cameras. The device has already got a plethora of updates, and now that it's starting to become available in retail, it received yet another one with version 16.1210.1906.156 that adds ARCore capability, further camera refinements, and the June 2019 Android security patch. </p>
<p> ASUS's ZenFone line may not be popular stateside, but that's not the case in overseas markets. Unfortunately, it looks like the ZenFone phones may soon have to be completely rebranded in India. This is thanks to a lawsuit made by Telecare Network, which owns the trademarks "ZEN" and "ZENMOBILE" in the country. </p>
<p> Last year's Asus Zenfone 5Z was an excellent phone with great hardware and an even better price point. The Zenfone 6, however, takes everything its predecessor did well and ups the ante with a wholly original design, powerful hardware, and a motorized flip-up camera, all while starting at $499 like the 5Z. </p>
<p> Asus today unveiled its 2019 flagship, the ZenFone 6. Sporting the latest hardware, its headlining features are its motorized flip camera, a huge 5,000mAh battery, and the very attractive starting price point of $499. </p>
<p> When ASUS started updating a few of its phones to Android Pie, it ran into issues for some models, including the Zenphone Max Pro M1 (ZB601KL) and Max M2 (ZB632KL). Their upgrade was supposed to roll out in March, but the company had to apologize and delay the release to mid-April. True to its word, ASUS is now pushing the new software to the first devices in a staged distribution, starting in India. </p>
<p> Asus has already rolled out Pie to a few of its phones, but the vast majority are still stuck on Android 8.0 Oreo (or older). Three phones were expected to get Pie soon — the Zenfone Max Pro M1, Max Pro M2, and Max M2 — but now have to wait a bit longer. </p>

<p> zenfone 2 </p>
<p> ASUS isn't always the best with updates. The company often releases phones with already-outdated software, like the ZenFone 3 Zoom that came with Marshmallow. In a similar vein, the ZenWatch 2 and 3 were some of the last watches to get Android Wear 2.0. But at the ZenFone 4 launch event, ASUS promised that the entire ZenFone 3 and 4 lineup would get Android O. </p>
<p> Asus just announced new ZenFones, but the ZenFone 2 isn't a bad device—especially if you're talking about the ZenFone 2 Deluxe Special Edition. It has the most storage, RAM, and the fastest hardware of any ZF2 variant, and it's on sale today as part of Amazon's Goldbox deal. It usually costs $399, which is not an amount you should pay, but right now it can be yours for just $269. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S III, first released back in 2012, only has official software support up to Android 4.3. No matter: the folks at the CyanogenMod development team are keeping the device alive long after Samsung threw in the towel. Today the AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint variants of the GSIII all get their very first nightly ROM builds for CyanogenMod 13, which is based on Android 6.0. You can find them at the d2att, d2tmo, and d2spr listings on the CM download page, respectively. </p>
<p> A number of Zenfone 2 owners have been making oddly similar complaints about a lack of storage space, and it looks like this isn't a case of poor management on their part. There may be a bug in the device that clogs the internal storage with multiple gigabytes of log files. What's worse, you can't do anything about it without root. </p>
<p> Still looking for that perfect gift? Well, I don't know about perfect, but the Zenfone 2 is pretty cool and it's on sale right now for $30 off the usual $299 price. You can get this deal at most retailers including Amazon, B&H, and the Asus shop. </p>
<p> Think of a smartphone manufacturer. Did you think Asus? Okay, maybe you did, but only because you just read the headline. The company makes phones, but they're hardly the best selling. That said, it attracted a lot of eyeballs this year with the release of the ZenFone 2, an affordable phone offering up to 4GB of RAM. And now Asus has announced that said device will get Android 6.0. </p>
<p> The Asus Zenfone 2 is one of the better mid-range unlocked phones out there thanks to the robust Intel Atom SoC lurking within. Now it looks like there's a new version of this device that ships with 16GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. It's selling for $229, which is a pretty good price for what you get. </p>
<p> As I sit here in a hip Los Angeles coffee shop across from the seemingly never-ending whooshes and rumbles of LA traffic on a busy boulevard just outside the door, I wonder if $4 is a reasonable price for the latte now sitting in front of me. It does have one of those latte art fern-shaped things on it. Or, at least it looks like a fern to me. </p>
<p> While not a tiny amount of money, it doesn't seem totally unreasonable. (And trust me: $4 for a latte is a respectable price in Los Angeles.) After all, I am availing myself the use of said business's counter, its rather lovely interior inspired by the owner's Taiwanese heritage (well, supposedly), a nice ceramic cup for my beverage, and the generally relaxed atmosphere the place provides. </p>
<p> 64GB? Kid's stuff. 128GB? Paltry. Real smartphone spec-hounds will settle for nothing less than 256GB of local onboard storage (which, incidentally, is more than many laptops these days). At least they'd settle for nothing less if any of those phones were actually available. There will be one soon, in at least one location: the ASUS Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special Edition. It's coming to Brazil sometime in the future for an unspecified price, though "quite a lot" would be a safe bet. The model was shown off on the official ASUS Brazil blog. </p>
<p> The Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special Edition is identical to the high-end version of the original Zenfone 2, with 4GB of RAM and a faster Atom Z3580 processor, with the obvious exception of the greater storage capacity. </p>

<p> zenfone 2 199 review </p>
<p> When you think smartphones, ASUS probably rarely comes to mind. While the company has been building Android phones for several years now, their market penetration outside of Asia has been relatively low, and so they rarely get much attention in American or European markets. But the ZenFone 2, when it launched at CES six months ago, definitely raised eyebrows. </p>
<p> At a starting price of just $199, ASUS is offering up a phone with extremely impressive specifications for a do-a-double-take MSRP - it almost sounds too good to be true. Thankfully, I don't think it is - the ZenFone 2 is a solid phone that works pretty much like any Android 5.0+ device you'll encounter while simultaneously blowing the doors off pretty much any competitor at this price point for raw spec sheet power. </p>

<p> Operating system updates don't come quickly in the Android world. They show up fashionably late, nevermind that parties where everyone looks forward to a new software release aren't the kind where people care how anyone is dressed. </p>
<p> ASUS is now doing its users a solid. No, it's not pushing out over-the-air updates to all of its devices right this moment. But it is doing the next best thing, which is listing which phones will get the update. </p>
<p> The Asus Zenfone 2 was a solid smartphone for a reasonable price, but there are some more exotic variants of the Zenfone 2 out there. Now, you can buy them in the US. I refer, of course, to the Zenfone 2 Laser and Deluxe, which have been available internationally for a while. Asus has them in stock, but other retailers are coming soon. </p>

<p> The ZenFone 2 was one of the best budget phones to launch last summer, and the Laser variant (named after a laser auto-focus module) was a good follow-up. Now the latter (ZE500KL model) is getting its Android 6.0 update, WW_13.10.6.16_M3.6.44. </p>
<p> Owners of some of Asus' camera-oriented smartphones are getting a nice surprise today with the announcement of sizable OTA updates. The OS version isn't changing, but both the Zenfone Zoom and Zenfone Laser 2 are getting big updates with tweaks, new features, and bug fixes galore. </p>
<p> Asus plans to bring Marshmallow to the Asus ZenFone 2 and its variants, but the when is still up in the air. Thanks to the CyanogenMod project, Asus ZenFone 2 Laser and Selfie owners can say the time is now. CM 13 nightly builds have arrived for the two devices, bringing with them Android 6.0. </p>
<p> Operating system updates don't come quickly in the Android world. They show up fashionably late, nevermind that parties where everyone looks forward to a new software release aren't the kind where people care how anyone is dressed. </p>
<p> ASUS is now doing its users a solid. No, it's not pushing out over-the-air updates to all of its devices right this moment. But it is doing the next best thing, which is listing which phones will get the update. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 2 series has gained no small amount of acclaim since its introduction thanks to good specs and low prices, and the Laser variant with its laser auto-focus module is the one to get if you want a better camera experience. Low prices and good hardware are the sea in which the Android modder swims, so naturally the Team Win Recovery Project has supported the line well. Now they've released an official version of their custom recovery for the ZenFone 2 Laser. You can download it now from the TWRP website. </p>
<p> ASUS has been getting more invested into the smartphone market, both in the US—where we recently talked about the ZenFone 2 Laser and ZenFone 2—and in their closer-to-home markets in the Eastern Hemisphere. This review will focus on two models that will not make it to the US, but should be of interest to those in Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea, and elsewhere. The main focus will be on the ZenFone Selfie, which is much like the familiar ZenFone 2 and ZenFone 2 Laser but with a high-quality front-facing camera sensor. I will also discuss the ZE550KL model of the ZenFone 2 Laser, which is available in some non-US markets. </p>

<p> Like many manufacturers, ASUS has its own Android skin - ZenUI. Version 4.0 of the skin was introduced alongside the company's ZenFone 4 lineup, but ASUS also promised to bring the new version to the existing ZF3 series. The update process has now begun, with the ZF3 Zoom becoming the first device to be updated. </p>
<p> ASUS isn't always the best with updates. The company often releases phones with already-outdated software, like the ZenFone 3 Zoom that came with Marshmallow. In a similar vein, the ZenWatch 2 and 3 were some of the last watches to get Android Wear 2.0. But at the ZenFone 4 launch event, ASUS promised that the entire ZenFone 3 and 4 lineup would get Android O. </p>
<p> Asus sort of missed the boat with the ZenFone 3 line, which took ages to come out in the US and then wasn't very competitive with other devices. The ZenFone 3 Deluxe was priced similarly to the OnePlus 3, but it wasn't as good. Asus isn't pretending the phone never happened, though. This phone is getting an Android 7.0 update, the first wide rollout of Nougat for Asus. </p>
<p> We're finally getting to the point where Nougat software updates are coming at a steady clip from manufacturers. ASUS is getting in a few for its midrange phone hardware - just last week we saw the ZenFone 3 Deluxe get its software update (that really should have come out in December at the latest). Now it's the non-deluxe model's turn, specifically the ZE520KL and ZE552KL variants. Those are the 5.2- and 5.5-inch versions of the unlocked GSM phone, if you haven't memorized the alphabet soup of those model numbers. </p>
<p> Asus announced the ZenWatch 3 several weeks ago, but neglected to provide information on when you could buy one. Irksome, but nothing compared to the Zenfone 3 that was available in some markets over the summer. Well, now you can finally plan to pick up both, if that's something you want to do. The ZenWatch 3 and all Zenfone 3 variants will be available in the coming weeks, but pricing on the Zenfone 3 is a little higher than expected. </p>
<p> We first heard about the newest additions to the ZenFone lineup back in late May, but ASUS didn't elaborate on availability for the United States. The ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe and ZenFone 3 Laser are now available to buy on Amazon for $530.48 and $206.95, respectively. However, they still won't ship for at least two weeks (if Amazon's information is correct). </p>
<p> The original ZenFone would be two years old this month, but I doubt many of them are still in use. It was highly anticipated before release, and widely panned shortly thereafter. I have friends who bought the first generation ZenFone, and the issues were obvious right from the start: the battery couldn't last half a day, the UI was clumsy and unresponsive, it got so hot you could barely hold it, and the build quality and design really weren't up to par. </p>
<p> A lot has changed in the last two years. The ZenFone 2 was well-received by our team and continues to be a good buy for the price. </p>
<p> Asus already has three different versions of the ZenFone 3 planned in fast food-style denominations: vanilla, Deluxe, and Ultra. The Deluxe is the highest-specced version ("Ultra" is about a bigger screen, not better specs), as it's equipped with the latest and greatest Snapdragon 820 processor. Of course that's no longer the latest and greatest: Qualcomm announced the even faster Snapdragon 821 just yesterday. Not to be outdone, a new version of the ZF3 Deluxe has been announced via a Taiwanese press release. </p>
<p> Johnny Shih, ASUS's enthusiastic chairman, today introduced the ZenFone 3 to the world (even though we reported on the ZenFone 4, 5, and 6 two years ago). Alongside the standard ZenFone 3, there are two other variants; the Deluxe and the Ultra. </p>
<p> ZenFone 3 </p>
<p> The ZenFone 3 is certainly a pretty phone. As with other ASUS products, it keeps the spun aluminum design, with glass covering the metal. A 5.5-inch 1080p display adorns the front of the device. ASUS is boasting a 77% screen-to-body ratio, which is impressive - it's stuck with the ZenFone 2's capacitive, hardware buttons too, utilising that bottom bezel space. </p>

This phone is getting an Android 7.0 update, the first wide rollout of Nougat for Asus. </p>
<p> Budget flagships are all the rage these days. After all, why would anyone pay $769 for something like a Google Pixel XL when similar or only marginally worse performance can be had from a $439 OnePlus 3T? The category has come a seriously long way since the Nexus 4 first pioneered it, largely thanks to loads of new entrants in the past few years from both new and storied nameplates. </p>
<p> Drop test videos have been pretty popular for a while, but after the iPhone 6 Plus's "bendgate," durability videos really took off. It's easy to understand why; existing owners want to be confident in their devices' build quality, and prospective buyers don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on something that can be scratched by a penny (ahem, Jet Black iPhone 7). In the latest JerryRigEverything video, Zack (not Jerry) takes a look at the ZenFone 3 Deluxe, one of ASUS's higher-end models. </p>

<p> Asus scored a big win with its high-end but relatively inexpensive Zenfone 2 design. It looks like the Taiwanese manufacturer is hoping to leverage that into a larger series of handsets, very much as Samsung has done with the Galaxy S. In fact, that's not the only thing the next Zenfone will have in common with the Galaxy S series. Red Dot 21, a a sort of product design showcase organized by the same people behind the Red Dot design awards, has new profiles for the as-yet unseen Zenfone 3 and Zenfone 3 Deluxe. (Note that this isn't an actual award, it just means that someone - presumably Asus itself - posted the profile pages.) </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/zenfone-4-max/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17555901" filename="zenfone-4-max">
<p> We're currently on the fifth generation of ASUS ZenFone devices, but that doesn't mean that previous models have been (entirely) forgotten. The ZenFone 4 Max has just begun receiving its update to Android 8.1 Oreo, which also includes ASUS's ZenUI 5.0 skin. This is a few months behind schedule, but at least it's here now. </p>
<p> Asus has announced which devices of the convoluted ZenFone 4 family are coming to North America. The ZenFone 4 Pro, ZenFone 4, and ZenFone 4 Max all feature dual-camera systems, front-mounted fingerprint sensors, and Nougat. They'll be heading our way soon with their emphases on strong photography capabilities and value propositions. </p>
<p> TWRP is still the best custom recovery available, giving Android users a better way to flash ROMs and back up their devices. Part of the reason it's so great is that can be ported to new devices fairly easily. Since we last covered the project earlier this month, a few more phones have been added to the roster. </p>
<p> Asus was launching ZenFone 3 variants in the US as recently as a few months ago, but it also started pushing the first ZenFone 4 phones over the summer in select markets. Starting today, the ZenFone 4 series is rolling out in the US and Canada, but it's starting with the ZenFone 4 Max 5.5". This is hardly the most impressive device in the lineup, but it has a gigantic battery. </p>
<p> Those of you with a good memory may remember the ZenFone 4 name from a few years ago. In 2014, Asus was using screen sizes for its naming convention when it released the ZenFone 4, 5, and 6 with respective display sizes in inches. Here we are three years later, and Asus has long since switched to a more conventional chronological naming scheme for its ZenFone line. Following on from last year's ZenFone 3 series of phones, the first in the 2017 ZenFone 4 range has been revealed on Asus' Russian site. </p>

<p> zenfone 4 selfie pro </p>
<p> Team Win Recovery Project, or TWRP for short, is just about the only custom recovery worth using in 2017. It does everything most people need, works on a massive number of devices, and can be themed. The last time we covered TWRP, it added support for the Pixel 2 and a few other phones. Now the recovery is officially available for some of ASUS' new phones, and Xiaomi's first Android One device. </p>
<p> ASUS is still chugging along with its series of ZenFone devices, most recently with the AR and 3 Zoom. The first product in the ZenFone 4 lineup was quietly released in Russia last month, but it looks like four more are on the way. ASUS' online French store accidentally listed the unreleased phones, and promptly took them down - but not before they were noticed. </p>

<p> Zenfone 5 </p>
<p> Asus was relatively quick with its Android 10 rollout that reached the ZenFone 6 and 5Z in November, while the gaming-centric ROG Phone II got the update about a month back. With the flagships now covered, the Taiwanese brand wasn’t expected to extend the software coverage to older mid-rangers like the ZenFone 5, especially since the handset already got a major update last year. As it turns out, Asus is indeed working on its Android 10 update, and the developer version is already out. </p>
<p> It's been a few months since Google rolled out Android 9 Pie, which means that many OEMs with skinned UIs are gearing up to start updating their devices too. Samsung began its process with the S9 and S9+ on Christmas, and now Asus is following its footsteps with its Zenfone 5. </p>
<p> Advertising can get pretty stale these days, so it's always nice to see something different. ASUS took "different" and ran with it, throwing 89 ZenFone 5s on dancer Ian Eastwood to advertise the ZenFone 5/5z. The result is... quite the spectacle. </p>
<p> ASUS' Android phones might slide under the radar for most, but the company's new ZenFone 5 series probably won't. The company has had some trouble historically trying to penetrate the US phone market to any great depth—perhaps a result of its crowded, sometimes confusing product portfolio—but nonetheless it persists. Some of its phones have even been pretty good. But now that the wraps have been taken off its latest line of phones, it seems like ASUS has found a successful way to attract the attention it wanted: by copying the iPhone X's notch. </p>
<p> Asus, as we expected, showed off the new ZenFone 5 family at MWC. Unlike years past, the Taiwanese company is keeping in step with modern smartphone trends, in some cases to the point of plain copying the iPhone X. Regardless, some of the new devices look fantastic and our initial impressions are relatively positive. </p>
<p> We just got back from a meeting at ASUS's CES suite, and we had a chance to go hands-on with the full portfolio of the company's new Android products (apart from Padfone X, which sadly sat walled off in a glass case). Of great interest to some of you, no doubt, are the company's new ZenFone handsets. Johnny Shih, ASUS's enthusiastic chairman, announced the ZenFone 4, 5, and 6, would be priced at $99, $149, and $199, respectively. With all three phones utilizing dual-core Intel Ivy Trail+ chipsets and powered by Android 4.3, that's certainly an attractive proposition. Were there any immediately apparent downsides, though? </p>
<p> ASUS is breaking out its phone lineup at CES in a big way. The new "ZenFone" series is coming in 4-inch, 5-inch, and 6-inch versions to suit just about anybody, and each one of these new devices will be sold in a variety of metallic colors. Features and specs vary a bit between models, but the basic gist is that you pick your screen size and work up from there. All of them are on the low end and aimed at price-conscious buyers. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 4 is at the bottom of the spectrum, featuring a 4-inch LCD 840x400 screen. (Remember those?) </p>

<p> zenfone 5 lite </p>
<p> ASUS's latest generation of ZenFones was introduced at MWC in February, and three months later, we're finally starting to hear about US availability. The ZenFone 5Q, which is called the ZenFone 5 Lite in other markets, has arrived stateside for $299. It can be purchased from B&H, Best Buy, Newegg, and several other retailers. </p>

<p> It seems like Asus loves to create a muddled, crowded mobile product portfolio. While this strategy might work in the PC hardware space (where the Taiwanese company has plenty of respect, including from me), it just confuses and frustrates smartphone consumers. We already saw a possible leak a few days ago about one model in Asus' upcoming ZenFone 5 line, even though the ZenFone 4 family is still quite new, and now Evan Blass has shown off an image of the ZenFone 5 Lite over on Twitter. </p>

<p> zenfone 5q </p>
<p> At MWC, Asus showed off its 2018 Zenfone lineup. Most of the attention fell on the 5Z and 5, with their display notches and fresh designs. Perhaps left to the wayside was the lower-end device of this family, the Zenfone 5Q (or Lite, depending on where you are). It doesn't resemble its brethren whatsoever, right down to even lacking a notch. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/zenfone-5z/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549821" filename="zenfone-5z">
<p> zenfone 5z </p>
<p> Android 10 beta testing for ASUS’ last two flagships — the ZenFone 6 and the ZenFone 5Z — is already underway since August, though only for a small, closed group. The early ZenUI version for the 5Z reportedly came laden with a long list of bugs that essentially held off its public release for a while. ASUS appears to have addressed many of those flaws, and is now making the ZenUI 6 open beta available to a wider userbase of its 2018 flagship. </p>
<p> If you don't have a Pixel phone to get into that sweet, sweet Android Q Beta business, you've got more than a dozen third-party phones that can help you get there. But with each phone comes its own catches, so we'll patch you through to the resources you need from the OEMs. </p>
<p> While we wait and get excited for 2019's smartphone selection, it's a great time to pick up last year's offerings for cheap. Take this deal for example, where B&H is asking $399 for Asus' excellent Zenfone 5Z. That's $100 off the MSRP. </p>
<p> Slices of Pie are reaching more and more devices. Ever since Android's latest version was released for Google's line-up, other companies like HMD, Samsung, Sony, Xiaomi, and OnePlus have joined in on the fun. Another OEM, Asus, started its Pie rollout with the Zenfone 5 earlier this month, and is now following up with the higher-end 5Z. </p>
<p> When Asus announced the Zenfone 5 lineup at MWC, all eyes were fixed on the the king of the group, the 5Z. Fast forward almost six months and the phone is finally available to purchase at a mere $500 in the U.S. While the high-end Android flagship market is squarely controlled by Samsung, there's a curious middle ground between budget and top-tier devices. This "affordable flagship" space is heavily populated with offerings from OnePlus, Honor, and Xiaomi, but Asus has set its sights on a piece of that pie with the 5Z. </p>
<p> The ZenFone 5Z is the latest flagship device from Asus, sporting a notched 18:9 screen, a Snapdragon 845 processor, and dual rear cameras. Pre-orders went live last month, and now the phone is officially on sale. Asus told us that only the 64GB storage/6GB RAM model will be sold in the United States - not the beefier models with 128/256GB storage and 8GB RAM. </p>
<p> Asus announced the ZenFone 5Z all the way back in February. It's very much a 2018 Android device: it's got a Snapdragon 845, six or eight gigs of RAM, two cameras, and of course, that notch. Months later, the 5Z is now available for pre-order. You can reserve one now for the low price of $499.99. </p>
<p> Advertising can get pretty stale these days, so it's always nice to see something different. ASUS took "different" and ran with it, throwing 89 ZenFone 5s on dancer Ian Eastwood to advertise the ZenFone 5/5z. The result is... quite the spectacle. </p>

<p> zenfone 7 pro </p>
<p> Android 11 has been available on Pixel phones for a while now, but most other devices are still on Android 10. Asus started accepting closed beta signups for the Zenfone 7 Pro last month, and now the first Android 11 build is rolling out to testers. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/09/03 6:00am PDTon Sep 3, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/10 9:16am PDTon Oct 10, 2020. </p>
<p> If it wasn't for the Pixel 3a, the Asus Zenfone 6 probably could've been a surprise hit in 2019. It packed an almost stock-like Android experience, the best processor on the market (back then), and a unique flip camera. We worried that Asus' creation could turn out to be a flash in the pan, but after spending two weeks with the Zenfone 7 Pro, I can confirm that it is an improvement over that already great phone. It comes with a higher price, though. </p>
<p> Asus released its first Android 11 beta build last week — not for the latest ZenFone 7 line but yesteryear’s ZenFone 6. It’s not typical for companies to treat their older models with latest Android updates before their current flagships, but nothing seems to be going straight in 2020, so what the heck. The ZenFone 7 and 7 Pro are at last catching up with their predecessor as they’re now getting their own Android 11 beta program, which you can sign up for right away. </p>
<p> Asus revealed the Zenfone 7 and 7 Pro last month, following months of rumors and speculation. If you don't plan on sticking with the stock ROM, Asus has now released the bootloader unlock tool for both phones, as well as kernel source code packages for developers to try out. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/zenfone-ar/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17553477" filename="zenfone-ar">
<p> Google's ARCore technology is building steam since its initial test launch on Pixel and Galaxy S8 phones. This came with a promise to support more phones, which was followed a few weeks later with a half-dozen more phones added during MWC. To keep the momentum going, Google also featured nearly 90 new apps and games that made use of ARCore in some way. Now with the latest update, we can likely guess at the next phones on the list. </p>
<p> The ZenFone AR was a peculiar device when it launched. Just looking at the specs, it seems rather beefy for the time—few phones with the Snapdragon 821 had 6/8GB RAM options. This was all intended for use with Google's Project Tango augmented reality platform, but that was unceremoniously killed last December. As a result, the ZenFone AR is getting a $200 price cut. </p>
<p> If you're interested in experiencing augmented reality on Android, you have very few options. The ASUS ZenFone AR is one of them. We reviewed it back in August and came to the conclusion that it's not a bad phone. Now you can pick one up for $499.99, $100 off its MSRP, on Amazon. </p>
<p> ASUS isn't traditionally a manufacturer of expensive or interesting phones, but the ZenFone AR satisfies both of those characteristics. At $699 in the top spec, the Tango-equipped ZenFone AR was (and is) a tough sell. But if you were interested in the 6GB RAM/64GB storage version, you can now score one for $50 off MSRP from a few retailers. </p>
<p> There has only been one Tango phone up to this point, the hilariously oversized Lenovo Phab2 Pro. Now, Asus is arriving on the scene with a phone that actually looks like a phone rather than a re-badged tablet. The ZenFone AR went on sale through Verizon last night, and now it's live on Amazon as an unlocked device. For a mere $599, you can begin exploring augmented reality, which I hear is way cooler than regular reality. </p>
<p> The first phone to be equipped with Google's Project Tango augmented-reality capabilities was the Lenovo Phab2 Pro. If you read our review, you'll know that it wasn't a good experience at all. But another Tango-powered phone is on the way, and you can order it now from Verizon. </p>
<p> Mobile VR hasn't really taken off, and Google's augmented-reality Project Tango experiment is in the same boat. The first publicly-available phone with Project Tango, the Lenovo Phab2 Pro, launched last year. If you read our review, you'll know that the massive size, poor performance, and price made it a hard sell even for VR/AR enthusiasts. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, the upcoming Tango-powered ZenFone AR already has a major flaw; it will be a Verizon-exclusive in the United States. </p>
<p> This year's CES has a couple more days yet to go, but the announcements for the show have settled out, and we probably won't be seeing any more big news from the world's largest technology conference. As such, we're about to head out ourselves from Las Vegas, and we're leaving you with some of our favorite technology announced this year. Without further ado, these are Android Police's picks for the Best of CES in 2017. (Presented in no particular order.) </p>
<p> ASUS announced at CES today that it was releasing two new smartphones, the ZenFone 3 Zoom and the ZenFone AR. Fortunately, both were also on demo for us to try out - and try them out we did. </p>
<p> The first of the two, the ZenFone 3 Zoom, is the more interesting product conceptually if you ask me. It uses an iPhone 7 Plus-style dual-camera array to provide two different effective zoom and frame sizes for your photos, and that should come in handy for shooting portrait photos. It also features dual-pixel autofocus (first introduced on phones with the Galaxy S7) to ensure your shots are nice and crisp in almost any light. </p>
<p> Asus is announcing two new smartphones at CES, and each of them is notable for different reasons. There's the ZenFone 3 Zoom (left), which as the name implies, has optical zoom. Then there's the ZenFone AR (right), which was leaked by Qualcomm's site a few days ago. </p>

<p> zenfone max </p>
<p> Asus has promised to release Android Marshmallow for many of its ZenFone devices by the second quarter of 2016 and it seems to be rushing now to make good on its deadline. The first device to get the update was the ZenFone 2 Laser ZE500KL and ZE550KL, and today another model joins it: the ZenFone Max. </p>
<p> The ZenFone Max isn't just good enough to star in a series of speed rapping videos, it's also great if you want a phone that lasts for two days straight thanks to a hefty 5000mAh battery. This update that it should start receiving OTA today is version WW_13.8.26.31. </p>
<p> Operating system updates don't come quickly in the Android world. They show up fashionably late, nevermind that parties where everyone looks forward to a new software release aren't the kind where people care how anyone is dressed. </p>
<p> ASUS is now doing its users a solid. No, it's not pushing out over-the-air updates to all of its devices right this moment. But it is doing the next best thing, which is listing which phones will get the update. </p>
<p> ASUS is riding high on ZenFone Fever, and at an event in India called - wait for it - Zenfestival, the company announced a slew of new ZenFone models. ZenFone 2 Deluxe, ZenFone 2 Laser, ZenFone Selfie, and ZenFone Max. Well, actually, only one of them was new - the ZenFone Max. The Laser, Deluxe, and Selfie were all announced previously, but the Max is the only really interesting one anyway (it even has a laser, don't worry). </p>
<p> The ZenFone Max is clearly targeted at emerging markets, blending an extremely large 5000mAh battery (how thick is this phone?) with a much more modest Snapdragon 410 processor, compared to the speedy if power-hungry Intel Atoms in the standard ZenFone 2. </p>

<p> After the ZenFone Max and a couple of variants of the ZenFone 2 Laser, ASUS is now starting to roll out Android 6.0 Marshmallow to the ZenFone Zoom (ZX551KL) and ZenFone Selfie (ZD551KL). </p>
<p> The ZenFone Zoom is moving to firmware version 4.21.40.74 while the Zenfone Selfie is going up to 21.40.0.1692. Both devices are shedding a lot of preloaded apps (read: bloat) and gaining a couple of new apps from Google and/or Facebook. </p>
<p> I'm pretty sure something was lost in translation between the different reviews of ASUS' more recent generations of phones and the company's software development team. Everyone has lamented the high customization of ZenUI, the software layer that ASUS has slapped on top of Android, and its endless list of pre-installed and useless apps. On our own team, different writers unanimously pointed to the software as the major drawback for the Zenfone 2, Zenfone 2E, Zenpad S 8.0, Zenfone Selfie, and Zenfone 2 Laser. So what's ASUS to do to fix that? </p>
<p> Add more bloat. For realsies. That's what's happening with the latest update to the Zenfone Selfie, as if the phone wasn't full of preloaded crapware already. </p>
<p> Operating system updates don't come quickly in the Android world. They show up fashionably late, nevermind that parties where everyone looks forward to a new software release aren't the kind where people care how anyone is dressed. </p>
<p> ASUS is now doing its users a solid. No, it's not pushing out over-the-air updates to all of its devices right this moment. But it is doing the next best thing, which is listing which phones will get the update. </p>
<p> Today at a press event during Computex, ASUS announced many new Android products, and I'm guessing you'll be intrigued by at least one of them. </p>
<p> ZenWatch 2 </p>
<p> Let's get to the headliner: the big news with the ZenWatch 2 is that it now comes in two sizes - 37mm and 41mm (width). The smaller 37mm sports an 18mm strap, with the 41mm having a larger 22mm band. Both have AMOLED dipslays with Gorilla Glass 3, IP67 dust and water resistance, magnetic charging cables, and use unspecified Qualcomm processors (likely still a Snapdragon 400). The ZenWatch 2 has a crown now, too, which ASUS says adds functionality, but isn't exactly specifying how just yet. </p>

<p> zenfone zoom </p>
<p> Memorial Day weekend is nigh upon us, so seeing some sales pop up is not surprising. Tonight, we have one courtesy of B&H. You can get an Asus ZenFone Zoom for $179.99 with a free ZenPower 10,500mAh portable battery pack. That's a respectable savings of $170, with sales tax only applying to New York/New Jersey residents. </p>
<p> Unlocked phones are great. You can take them to whichever carrier you desire, you usually have greater control over software modification, and you don't have to deal with contracts. Amazon seems to think so, too; as a result, it's running an "Amazon Unlocked Phone Event" that starts today, with discounts on Sony Xperia, LeEco, Lenovo, ASUS, and Coolpad smartphones. </p>
<p> Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but tons of great deals are still out there. Case in point: ASUS's photography-oriented ZenFone Zoom is on sale from both B&H and Newegg for $199. That's the same deal that ASUS offered on Black Friday, and a whopping $200 off its MSRP of $399, effectively making the phone half-price. </p>
<p> After the ZenFone Max and a couple of variants of the ZenFone 2 Laser, ASUS is now starting to roll out Android 6.0 Marshmallow to the ZenFone Zoom (ZX551KL) and ZenFone Selfie (ZD551KL). </p>
<p> The ZenFone Zoom is moving to firmware version 4.21.40.74 while the Zenfone Selfie is going up to 21.40.0.1692. Both devices are shedding a lot of preloaded apps (read: bloat) and gaining a couple of new apps from Google and/or Facebook. </p>
<p> What do you do when your phone is running low on battery and you must make a phone call because the wife expects you to do some grocery shopping before you get home or because your tummy has started rumbling and your only path to salvation is through the gooey cheese-stuffed crusts of a pepperoni pizza? </p>
<p> Well, you either whip out your speed rapping skills that you innately acquired that very moment to blast through an entire conversation in a few seconds, or you wish you were using an ASUS Zenfone Max with its 5000mAh battery to never, ever, have that problem in the first place. </p>
<p> Owners of some of Asus' camera-oriented smartphones are getting a nice surprise today with the announcement of sizable OTA updates. The OS version isn't changing, but both the Zenfone Zoom and Zenfone Laser 2 are getting big updates with tweaks, new features, and bug fixes galore. </p>
<p> Operating system updates don't come quickly in the Android world. They show up fashionably late, nevermind that parties where everyone looks forward to a new software release aren't the kind where people care how anyone is dressed. </p>
<p> ASUS is now doing its users a solid. No, it's not pushing out over-the-air updates to all of its devices right this moment. But it is doing the next best thing, which is listing which phones will get the update. </p>
<p> It wasn’t long ago that ASUS, while beloved by many on the desktop computing scene, was hardly a player when it came to smartphones. Some early Android tablet adopters will remember their Transformer books, but the ZenFone line is relatively new and has been the most serious attempt by ASUS to break into phones. It would be easy to overstate the popularity of the ZenFone, especially in western markets, but there’s no doubt that lovers of Android now have ASUS on their radar. </p>
<p> We at Android Police have looked at several ZenFones and the latest entry is the ZenFone Zoom, which is a characteristic mixture of uniqueness, ambition, value, and zaniness that we have seen before. </p>
<p> Asus announced the ZenFone Zoom over a year ago, but despite how long the phone has taken to arrive stateside (after having long ago launched in other parts of the world), the phone is still a unique piece of hardware. Optical zoom is a rare thing to find in a smartphone camera, as is the dedicated camera button. </p>

<p> ZeniMax </p>
<p> It looks like Bethesda has canceled the widely hated Commander Keen mobile reboot. The resurrection of the 1990 classic was announced at E3 2019 a year ago and was instantly slammed as a weak free-to-play cash-grab reinterpretation that has nothing to do with the original platformer. While neither Bethesda nor the studio developing the title, ZeniMax, have officially stated that the project is canceled, there's an overwhelming body of evidence that the title won't see further development. </p>
<p> It's been known that the popular MMORPG The Elder Scrolls Online would be coming to Stadia since the very beginning, but only recently did we learn that the game would be launched on June 16th. As of a few moments ago, ESO is officially available on the Stadia Store, and the base game is free for all Pro members. Now, this free version does not include any of the game's expansions outside of the Morrowind chapter, which coincidentally means the latest chapter Greymoor isn't included either, but thanks to the game's PC cross-save functionality, whatever you already own on PC is included with the Stadia version (all of my Zone and Dungeon DLC is indeed intact), as long as you link your accounts. </p>
<p> Bethesda’s E3 2019 show has revealed the first look at the return of Commander Keen, a platforming series that started its life as a DOS game back in 1990. It was one of id Software’s earliest titles, and its corpse has been resurrected by ZeniMax Online Studios (a subsidiary of ZeniMax Media, Bethesda's parent company) as a free-to-play reinterpretation of the series for mobile. As you can imagine, fans aren't very pleased. </p>
<p> The tale of ZeniMax vs. The World of VR is developing into a modern-day saga of Homeric proportions with each new filing. Although Oculus/Facebook was found innocent of ZeniMax's previous accusations, it did end up having to cough up around $500 million as a result of NDA violations, copyright infringements, and for lying about a few things. Even so, it seemed as if the general dance was winding down and all the monsters short of the inevitable appeals had been slain. But the Hydra's heads are many, and ZeniMax is back with a new target: Samsung. </p>

<p> OnePlus is on the verge of releasing another flagship, but new hardware isn't the only thing coming soon. Zen Mode debuted last year and is now gaining new features worthy of a 2.0 label, including support for group rooms so you can disconnect together and five new themes that bring a revamped look and feel to the experience. </p>
<p> After recently receiving some additional timer settings, OnePlus’ Zen Mode app is picking up a set of challenges and a fresh reward system, as part of an update to version 1.4. With its new 21-day ZZZen challenge, the Chinese company wants you to avoid blinding yourself with a smartphone screen before hitting the bed. </p>
<p> OnePlus introduced Zen Mode together with its latest flagship device, aiming at helping users take a break from technology and spend more time interacting with the real world. The company just published the app on the Play Store, making it easier to update it for the 7 and 7 Pro, but also to release it for older devices. </p>
<p> Last Friday, OnePlus pushed out an update for the 6 and 6T, bringing, among other things, the DC dimming feature from the OnePlus 7 Pro and previous Open Beta updates to the mainstream. OTAs rolled out over the weekend (sorry we missed it, I was on vacation) but in case you didn't get it or would prefer to manually flash, the company has posted downloads for the pair of updates today. </p>
<p> Over the weekend, OnePlus appears to have silently (accidentally?) rolled out its next Android Q Developer Preview for the OnePlus 7 Pro. Among the included features are new "super macro" and focus tracking settings for the camera, Digital Wellbeing, configurable Zen Mode duration, and new options for gesture navigation. Although the previous Developer Preview 3 landed for the OnePlus 7, 7 Pro, 6, and 6T all at once, for now only the 7 Pro appears to have Developer Preview 4 early. </p>
<p> Smartphones have been out for way longer than the so-called "Digital Wellbeing" features that have been created to limit the screen-centered habits we've developed over many years. It'll take some convincing for consumers to willingly kick those patterns and it appears that's exactly what OnePlus is trying to do in promoting and explaining the convictions (or lack thereof) of its recently-introduced the Zen Mode app. </p>
<p> We're coming to the end of another road, everyone. OnePlus has started rolling out the last Open Beta for the 5/5T. At least it brings Zen Mode to the phones, a feature the 6/6T got not too long ago. There are some other improvements, too, as usual, but for a final beta, it has only one highlighting feature. </p>
<p> In addition to providing fast and frequent updates, OnePlus is becoming one of the most communicative Android phone manufacturers: It's actually hearing and responding to requests for new features. Back in May, the company spoke out about reported issues and a handful of community requests for the 7 Pro — things like wide-angle video support, and an always-on display — and today it's providing further updates about those requests, as well as others. </p>
<p> Not too long after it said older phones would get some of the newest flagship features, OnePlus is rolling out a new Open Beta for the 6/6T that brings, among other things, Zen Mode and Screen Recorder. Yes, you've been able to sideload them before, but now they're a part of the update. </p>
<p> When OnePlus announced its latest flagship phone, there were some interesting software features introduced alongside the impressive new hardware. Not all of them will be coming to older OnePlus devices but many of them will, including Zen Mode and the native screen recording function. </p>

<p> zenonia </p>
<p> Gamevil's Zenonia franchise has been impossible to ignore on Android, if only because there have been four relatively high-budget releases in as many years. The fifth installment of the action RPG series, subtitled "Wheel Of Destiny" in the continuing tradition of semi-meaningless JRPG convention, is available now. It's a free download for anyone running Android 2.2 or later. </p>
<p> Gamevil's claim that Zenonia is the "definitive action RPG" might be a little dubious, but it's certainly got its share of fans. </p>
<p> If you're into gaming on your Android, then there's a solid chance that you've at least heard of Zenonia. But, for those that are not familiar with the series, Zenonia is an incredibly popular RPG made for the small screen, slightly reminiscent of old-school Zelda games. </p>
<p> Today marks the landing of the third episode in this epic trilogy, offering new features along with the same familiar gameplay that fans of the series have gotten used to. </p>

<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we have a new licensed pinball game from Zen, a stylish take on Minesweeper, two retro-inspired platformers, another Sparke "life" game, a simplified brawler, and a connect-the-dots puzzle game. Without further ado: </p>
<p> Are you a fan of cartoons produced, owned, and distributed by Fox Broadcasting Company? Hey, then it's your lucky day—well, unless you don't like pinball. Zen Pinball now has tables based on Bob's Burgers, Archer, Family Guy, and American Dad. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got several PC and console pilgrims including Hotline Miami, War Thunder, and Always Sometimes Monsters, a new Portal-inspired Zen Pinball table, a mashup of tactic, RPG, and city-building, and standard platformers and puzzlers. </p>
<p> After Star Wars, Marvel, and The Walking Dead, it seems like just about any property is fair game for Zen Studios' expanding pinball franchise. The latest addition is South Park, Comedy Central's foul-mouthed animated show now in its 18th season. As usual with Zen Pinball expansions, you can get the two new 3D tables as either a stand-alone paid app or as in-app purchase expansions to the original game. The separate app is $4, or each table is $2, so it works out the same. </p>
<p> The first table is just general South Park stuff, featuring a staggering number of characters, references, scene items, and voice clips from the show. </p>

Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a stylish platformer, a high-tech space fighter, a superhero novel-book, a turn-based roguelike, and a zombie pinball table. Without further ado: </p>
<p> Oscura: Second Shadow </p>
<p> The sequel to the well-regarded Oscura uses the overdone black foreground aesthetic for more than just ambiance: the sole source of light in most levels is your impish character's glowing hand. </p>
<p> If you're the kind of fan that absolutely must have a Star Wars version of everything in your life, then grab your officially licensed Ahsoka Tano phone case and head for the Play Store. Zen Studios, makers of the well-received Zen Pinball HD, have released their Star Wars-themed pinball app, creatively titled Star Wars Pinball. It's a reasonable $1.99, but unfortunately restricted to Android 4.0 devices and above, and thus tragically off-limits to the Special Edition R2-DROID2. </p>
<p> The game comes with the Empire Strikes Back table, and the Boba Fett and Clone Wars (The Cartoon Network series, not the lamentable prequel) tables can be downloaded for another two dollars each. </p>

<p> Update 2: Looks like the kinks have been worked out, and it's now available on the Galaxy Tab 10.1. </p>
<p> We first told you about Zen Pinball THD back in May, and it finally landed in the Android Market just a bit ago. I got the opportunity to test out the APK a few weeks ago, and I can assure you, it was well worth the wait. This is probably the single best pinball game that I've played on any device - the graphics are great, the tables are fantastic, and the overall feel of the game is absolutely stellar. </p>
<p> On Friday we told you about the arrival of Pinball HD for Tegra devices, but if that just wasn't your cup of tea where pinball is concerned, then you'll be happy to know that ZEN Pinball THD will become part of the Tegra Zone family soon. ZEN Pinball is a port from the popular Playstation 3 game of the same title, and this will be its first venture into the mobile world. </p>

<p> Wireless chargers come in several shapes and sizes over the years, from stands to pucks and even orbs, but the mechanics behind how they work can make them kind of a pain. Positioning needs to be just so, or the coil on your gadget won't line up with the coil in the charger, and nothing happens. Multi-coil chargers have been a thing for a while, but the new Zens Liberty steps things up drastically, with sixteen coils stacked and staggered across its face. You can pretty much just dump your phone wherever, and it'll charge. It even looks pretty dang snazzy if you opt for the glass-topped version, but you'll pay €199.99 (around $215 right now) for that privilege. </p>
<p> Wireless chargers use a big coil to create the field that actually charges your device, which is why placing your phone in just the right spot is usually necessary. Some chargers use multiple coils to increase the working area of the charger, but the new Zens Liberty sports a ridiculous 16-coil configuration that can charge up to two devices at once in any position, with up to 15W of output each. The company is even taking that level of overkill just a little bit further by offering a special edition model with a glass top so you can see all 16 coils. </p>

Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix.

<p> Zen Studios is well-known for its pinball games of popular franchises, such as Portal, Marvel, The Walking Dead, and Star Wars. The company is back with another one entry to the series now, themed by game developer Bethesda titles. </p>
<p> The three franchises used here are The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Fallout, and DOOM. I would compare the gameplay on these three pinball tables; however, because of the game's in-app purchases, I have only managed to play the Skyrim one. Which was fun - it reminded me of wasting away hours on the Windows XP pinball game. To play the Fallout or DOOM tables, you either have to pay real money for in-game coins, or earn money on the Skyrim table. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/zenui/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17550103" filename="zenui">
<p> Android 10 beta testing for ASUS’ last two flagships — the ZenFone 6 and the ZenFone 5Z — is already underway since August, though only for a small, closed group. The early ZenUI version for the 5Z reportedly came laden with a long list of bugs that essentially held off its public release for a while. ASUS appears to have addressed many of those flaws, and is now making the ZenUI 6 open beta available to a wider userbase of its 2018 flagship. </p>
<p> When Asus announced the Zenfone 5 lineup at MWC, all eyes were fixed on the the king of the group, the 5Z. Fast forward almost six months and the phone is finally available to purchase at a mere $500 in the U.S. While the high-end Android flagship market is squarely controlled by Samsung, there's a curious middle ground between budget and top-tier devices. This "affordable flagship" space is heavily populated with offerings from OnePlus, Honor, and Xiaomi, but Asus has set its sights on a piece of that pie with the 5Z. </p>
<p> At MWC, Asus showed off its 2018 Zenfone lineup. Most of the attention fell on the 5Z and 5, with their display notches and fresh designs. Perhaps left to the wayside was the lower-end device of this family, the Zenfone 5Q (or Lite, depending on where you are). It doesn't resemble its brethren whatsoever, right down to even lacking a notch. </p>
<p> Back at CES, Asus showed off a follow-up to the not-so-old Zenfone 4 Max, which was a phone that ultimately disappointed me. Attempting to capitalize on the love for big batteries, the Taiwanese company decided to spin off the Zenfone Max line into its own device family. These phones will offer large batteries and many of the latest smartphone trends for budget prices. </p>
<p> ASUS' Android phones might slide under the radar for most, but the company's new ZenFone 5 series probably won't. The company has had some trouble historically trying to penetrate the US phone market to any great depth—perhaps a result of its crowded, sometimes confusing product portfolio—but nonetheless it persists. Some of its phones have even been pretty good. But now that the wraps have been taken off its latest line of phones, it seems like ASUS has found a successful way to attract the attention it wanted: by copying the iPhone X's notch. </p>
<p> Asus, as we expected, showed off the new ZenFone 5 family at MWC. Unlike years past, the Taiwanese company is keeping in step with modern smartphone trends, in some cases to the point of plain copying the iPhone X. Regardless, some of the new devices look fantastic and our initial impressions are relatively positive. </p>
<p> ASUS has just announced that Oreo is now rolling out to the ZenFone 4 via its ZenTalk forum. Released just a couple of months ago alongside its siblings, the ZenFone 4 Pro and ZenFone 4 Max, the ZenFone 4 (ZE554KL) is now receiving 8.0 over the air, though it may take a few days to reach your device. </p>
<p> Three months ago, ASUS promised to update the ZenFone 3 product line to ZenUI 4.0: a trimmed down, more minimal version of the company's software. They started with the ZenFone 3 Zoom at the same time as that announcement, and just recently the ZenFone 4 Max got it. Three months later, its forebear the ZenFone 3 Max is able to join the fun. The update will be rolling out over the next week. </p>
<p> ASUS has been working on its custom Android skin for years, named 'ZenUI.' The fourth major version first appeared on some Zenfone 4 devices, but a few in that line were still rocking ZenUI 3. One of these was the Zenfone 4 Max, and now ASUS is finally getting around to updating it. </p>

<p> zenwatch 3 </p>
<p> After the last deal alert, this one might feel a bit anticlimactic — after all, I did say that Samsung's smartwatches are the ones to buy if you're interested in that product segment. But if your heart is set on Android Wear, and bless your soul, then this sale on Asus' ZenWatch 3 might interest you. The best Android Wear watch is currently $179.99, a nice $50 off. </p>
<p> It has been about five months since Android Wear 2.0 was released, but a few major watches still don't have the update. The ZenWatch 2 and 3 are two wearables that have waited months for it, and while ZW2 owners will have to keep waiting, it has finally arrived for the ZenWatch 3. </p>
<p> Looking for a nice, stylish smartwatch? If so, you may want to have a look at the ASUS ZenWatch 3, which we called "the best Android Wear device you can get" in our review. Amazon will now sell you a ZW3 for as little as $194.99, which is the lowest price we've ever seen there. </p>
<p> When Google listed all of the watches that would receive Android 2.0, I was surprised. I only expected a handful of wearables to make the jump, but nearly all of them (besides the earliest models) were marked as compatible. Unfortunately, it's taking a while to deliver on that promise; fast forward five months later, and a few models are still waiting on an update. </p>
<p> Android Wear 2.0 was officially released in February, but many watches are still waiting on an official update. The ZenWatch 2 and 3 were confirmed to get the new version (the original ZenWatch was left out), but last we heard, it would come sometime in Q2 2017. Now the rollout seems to be in full swing, at least for the ZenWatch 3. </p>
<p> In one of those not-so-surprising pieces of news this morning, Digitimes reported that Asus might be throwing in the towel on Android Wear. Despite the slight revitalization we've seen throughout this year, the sales numbers for the ZenWatch line are not looking good. </p>
<p> Both the ASUS ZenWatch 2 and 3 were confirmed to receive the Android Wear 2.0 update back earlier this month. While a few weeks of waiting are to be expected with major update rollouts, ASUS says ZenWatch owners will have to wait a while longer. </p>
<p> Although Android Wear 2.0 has been put off until "early 2017," ASUS isn't waiting for the update to deliver its own improvements and fixes. The company has released OTA updates for the ZenWatch 2 and ZenWatch 3, with some exciting new features (well, for ZW3 owners). </p>
<p> Asus has been one of the more persistent promoters of Android Wear since it was released. As other companies have scaled back on wearables, Asus is full speed ahead with a third-generation ZenWatch. The first ZenWatch was a solid addition to the initial wave of watches, and the ZenWatch 2 had some appeal due to the extremely competitive price. Both those watches had the same rounded square body and general aesthetic, but the ZenWatch 3 is a radical departure. This is a completely round watch—no flat tire—and it makes more tweaks to the UI of Android Wear than any watch I've used before. </p>
<p> At the beginning of the month, Asus announced that its latest Android Wear offering, the ZenWatch 3, would be available in the early part of November. It looks like the company came through with its promise. The ZenWatch 3 is now available to order for $229 through the Asus store and B&H. I daresay that this looks like a very nice piece. </p>

<p> zero day </p>
<p> Mozilla has patched a zero-day exploit in late revisions to Firefox 72 and version 68 of the Android web browser. In a security advisory, the company said that it was made aware of "targeted attacks in the wild abusing this flaw." </p>
<p> Android security has come a long way in recent years. The promotion of monthly patches has kept many rising threats at bay while Google Play Protect largely bars malware from the Play Store. Despite these achievements, there are still instances where bad actors can exploit Android's code for nefarious purposes. Google's Project Zero team recently reported such an incident, and you may be at risk if you own one of the affected phones. </p>
<p> Firefox developer Mozilla has rolled out an update to the release channel of its browser app for Android that adds an important security fix. The update to version number 67.0.3 patches the critical zero-day flaw and protects users from potential attacks. </p>
<p> Another day, another major security hole is found in a widely used piece of software. This time around, a flaw in Chrome's implementation of the FileReader API allowed sites to break out of their sandbox and execute native code. To make matters worse, Google said the exploit was being actively used before the company fixed it. </p>

<p> The first day of the Pwn2Own hacking contest held in Tokyo has concluded, and a dual-member team of white-hat hackers by the name of Fluoroacetate cleaned up the house. After successfully hacking past numerous devices from multiple manufacturers, such as Samsung and Xiaomi, the team collected a bounty of $145,000 and secured a commanding lead in the contest after accruing 15 Master of Pwn points. </p>
<p> The second annual Mobile Pwn2Own competition, run by HP TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, is fast approaching. This year's event will take place at the PacSec Applied Security Conference in Tokyo from November 13-14, and over $300,000 in cash and prizes is up for grabs. The Pwn2Own contest challenges security researchers to find and exploit vulnerabilities on mobile devices and rewards them by giving them the device they were able to compromise. In short, a contestant must "pwn" a device in order to own it. This year's event is sponsored by Google's Android Security Team and BlackBerry. </p>
<p> Contestants can receive $50,000 for compromising a mobile device using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, USB, or NFC. </p>

<p> zero hour </p>
<p> If you're a fan of high quality mobile games, there's a good chance you've at least tried your hand at Gameloft's Modern Combat series. The latest installment – Zero Hour – builds upon its predecessors to offer some of the most in-depth, graphically rich, immersive gameplay that we've ever seen on a mobile device. It seems like only yesterday graphics like these were considered amazing on consoles – and now they're readily available on phones and tablets. </p>
<p> It's pretty crazy to look at where we are with mobile games right now. Just a few short years ago, the most graphically impressive games we could get on our handsets were really anything but impressive. Now, we have games like Shadowgun, Dead Trigger, and Horn that take mobile gaming to a level that was good enough for the PC not all that long ago. </p>
<p> Gameloft has just released the trailer for Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour, which looks like it will raise the bar for mobile graphics even higher. </p>

<p> Building on the success of their cloud storage aggregator ZeroPC Cloud Navigator, ZeroDesktop introduced ZeroPC Photo Connect to Google's Play Store today. The app works on the same premise as its forebear, Photo Connect pulls together all your photos from popular storage services, ranging from Picasa to Facebook to Dropbox, Evernote, and Photobucket. </p>
<p> Besides offering access to your various photo storage services, Photo Connect brings photos together into a tiled "timeline" interface, allowing users to browse through photos from all sources at once, according to when they were uploaded. </p>
<p> ZeroPC is this crazy service that lets you access all the popular cloud services from one place. "All the popular cloud services" is shorthand for Box.net, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, Flickr, Google Docs, Instagram, Picasa and SugarSync. Yeah, everything. </p>
<p> The website is insane. They've whipped up an in-browser operating system. Imagine a Linux-based OS in your browser. That's exactly what the website looks like. </p>

<p> zero rating </p>
<p> Many don't realize that net neutrality isn't just about ensuring you aren't (directly or indirectly) charged more for data from specific services and sites, it's also about making sure telecom companies don't abuse their position to charge less in a practice called "zero rating." Being able to access some services without counting the data used against your plan might sound like a free bonus, but there could be hidden long-term costs. According to a recent multi-year study by Epicenter.works related to net neutrality enforcement in the EU, countries which have allowed zero rating have higher costs for wireless data in the long term. </p>
<p> It's a great time to be an American - at least, it's a great time if you're in charge of a huge telecommunications corporation and you've been sweating some of your anti-net neutrality practices. With the election of Donald Trump and a new chairman appointed at the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC's position on zero-rating policies like T-Mobile's Binge On data services, AT&T's free access to DirecTV Now, and Verizon's free NFL game streaming, has shifted. The Commission is no longer investigating these policies for any reason, according to briefs issued by newly-appointed chairman Ajit Pai. </p>
<p> There's some great news if you're an Optus customer. Starting from May 2nd, they will be zero-rating a number of online streaming services for their prepaid customers, allowing them to listen to as much music as they want without racking up a heavy data bill. </p>
<p> Optus is making this available to new and current customers on My Prepaid Ultimate, My Prepaid Daily Plus, and other selected plans. Virtually all the big streaming names are present: Spotify, Google Play Music, Pandora, and the Gold Coast-based Guvera. It's not strictly limited to music either, as iHeartRadio is also included. </p>
<p> Noticeably absent is Apple Music. According to Gizmodo Australia, this is possibly because Cupertino already has a strong partnership with rival network Telstra. </p>

<p> That comment section that we all use on Android Police and that we often see and use on other sites is powered by Disqus, a company that makes it easy for sites like us to have a highly interactive and independent comment section while also maintaining control over moderation. Disqus is a very coveted brand and now it belongs to Zeta Global. </p>
<p> If you've never heard of Zeta, please join me in raising an eyebrow. Apparently it's a "marketing technology company that helps leading brands acquire, retain and grow customer relationships." I am not sure I'm clear on what exactly that is still, so this quote from Zeta's CEO David Steinberg helped me a little: "We're redefining the marketing technology space with actionable data, artificial intelligence that answers business problems and a marketing hub that serves as the nerve center for data-driven marketers." </p>

<p> By now we've already seen the PlayStation Phone in a video or two, a number of pictures, and the usual batch of rumors. However, one of the few things we haven't known about the device is what its camera will be like. Well as of today, you can officially cross camera quality off the list of unknowns - four pictures taken by a certain "Sony Ericsson Zeus" have just hit Picasa: </p>
<p> A little digging revealed that all of these pictures were captured by a 5MP camera (with an aperture rating of 2.4 and a focal length of 4.1mm), and as the second one shows, it is indeed accompanied by a flash. </p>
<p> Well, this one's a bit special, isn't it? In a marked shift from the traditional blurrycam espionage, what we have here is a nice, calmly filmed tour of the no-longer-mythical Zeus device. While there isn't a great deal of new information presented in the video, we do catch a glimpse of a PlayStation icon in the menus. The software is labeled Gingerbread in the About screen, despite a distinctly Froyo-esque appearance. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/09/11 9:00am PDTon Sep 11, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/08 7:45am PDTon Oct 8, 2020. </p>
<p> I started out as a folding phone critic. In fact, I bought the Z Flip we reviewed this spring with the full intention of pointing out how dumb the idea was, except I was dead wrong. I fell in love with my little flip phone, and the last week spent with the Galaxy Z Fold2 has further cemented my change of heart. Folding phones are undeniably the future, and for the right folks, the Z Fold2 is a must-buy game-changer — though probably not for you. </p>
<p> I really can't stress enough how game-changing folding phones are. I know they're frequently (and fairly) criticized for things like display durability and price, but once you actually use one and understand the experience, something just clicks — or, at least, it did for me. They're still not for everyone, but if you absolutely need to maintain productivity on the go, then the Z Fold2 will be as disruptive to your idea of work as the early Blackberry phones were. In fact, to prove a point, I was able to do my entire job here at Android Police from the phone for most of a whole day. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/09/02 12:27pm PDTon Sep 2, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/05 11:17am PDTon Sep 5, 2020. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Z Fold2 is easily the most exciting Samsung smartphone of 2020, and maybe the most exciting smartphone of 2020 period. While I'm saving judgment for our final review of the Fold2 (coming soon), I do have some initial thoughts for folks considering a pre-order. And in short, I feel pretty positive about the phone so far. </p>
<p> After endless leaks and the company's own teasing, Samsung has officially unveiled the Galaxy Z Fold2 at its "Unpacked Part 2" event today. The successor to last year's Galaxy Fold packs plenty of improvements over the revamped and re-released original, including a more durable design, a folding glass and polymer display, a faster chipset, and bigger screens both inside and out. Those hoping to jump into foldables with this new generation will need to double-check their savings accounts, though, as the Z Fold2 comes in a wallet-destroying $1,999, with pre-orders opening tomorrow at 12:01 AM on September 2nd ahead of general availability on September 18th. </p>
<p> Samsung is all set to fully unveil its latest foldable phone at an Unpacked event on September 1, but there's seemingly very little about the device they'll be able to tell us that we don't already know. Images, videos, and specs have all leaked or been shared one way or another, but we now have potentially definitive information from a very reputable source. But we now have definitive confirmation of the price from Samsung itself, at least in the UK. </p>
<p> As promised back at Samsung's August 5th Unpacked event, the company is gearing up for another event on September 1st. The sequentially titled "Unpacked Part 2," looks to be all about the company's next folding phone: The Z Fold2. Mark your calendars for 10AM ET (7AM PT). </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold2 5G is now official. Rocking a Z Flip-style redesigned hinge, big folding 7.6" display (augmented by a smaller 6.2" Cover Screen), the phone will come in two colors, potentially including some hinge color customization options, as well as a Thome Browne edition. Reservations for the folding phone/tablet are also now open on Samsung's site. More official details are coming September 1st, together with pre-orders. In the meantime, Max Weinbach has spilled the beans. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/09/18 8:00am PDTon Sep 18, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/20 9:02am PDTon Sep 20, 2020. </p>
<p> Founded in 2015, Zhiyun has made it their mission to create versatile, easy-to-use gimbals for a variety of cameras and smartphones. Earlier this month, we shared a close look at the premium Crane 2S. This week, we have all the details on the new Smooth XS that comes with auto subject-tracking and a nifty selfie mode. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/09/08 8:00am PDTon Sep 8, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/14 8:53am PDTon Sep 14, 2020. </p>
<p> When trying to shoot the perfect video footage, having a steady hand just won't cut it. Videographers need a pro-level gimbal that provides device stability while also being easy to detach with just a click. This week, our friends at Zhiyun are giving away a Crane 2S gimbal to one lucky Android Police reader in the United States or Europe. Here's everything you need to know to enter. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/08/31 8:00am PDTon Aug 31, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/06 7:02pm PDTon Sep 6, 2020. </p>
<p> Professional videographers know that there's no such thing as simply pointing and shooting a perfect scene. Getting the ideal shot takes expertly crafted equipment — good lighting, a worthy camera, and a rock-solid gimbal — along with a skilled eye, all working in harmony. The Zhiyun Crane 2S gimbal provides pro-level stability and versatility, making it a must-have for any serious videographer. </p>
<p> Whether you're preparing for a trip across the world or just getting together a few essentials for a hike, it can be difficult to find space for everything that will come with you. If something is too big, it's staying at home. That's where most smartphone gimbals tend to fail the test: long handles and awkward shapes make them terrible to pack and annoying to carry. Zhiyun, a company highly regarded for its DSLR and smartphone gimbals, is preparing to release a new model called the Smooth-Q2 that's more compact than any smartphone gimbal on the market. Aside from a few basic sacrifices, it's a great little tool to really improve the quality of your videos. </p>

<p> The English alphabet only includes 26 different letters, but for many other languages that are not descendant from Latin, the number of valid characters is much larger. It turns out that this can make creating a keyboard that works well in those languages a bit difficult — imagine having a keyboard with hundreds or thousands of keys and you begin to get the picture. That's why Google has developed dedicated keyboard apps with alternative input methods specifically designed for languages such as Pinyin or Cantonese to make is easier for many (or maybe even most) users around the world to type in their native tongue. </p>
<p> If you don't use any language with a non-Latin alphabet, you've probably seen at least one of Google's alternative language keyboards and promptly dismissed it. But for a huge portion of Android's userbase, those things are essential tools for daily interaction. Today almost every one of Google's customized input/keyboard apps has been given a major update: Google Hindi Input, Google Japanese Input, Google Korean Input, Google Pinyin Input, and Google Zhuyin Input. </p>
<p> Old on the left, new on the right. </p>

<p> Looking for a cheap (read: free) way to get your digital magazine fix? Zinio has extended its $50 digital 'zine credit promo until the end of this month, and you can cash in on this offer right here (you have to make a new Zinio account). Zinio also has an Android app (Play Store link below), so you can read said digital magazines on pretty much any modern Android device. </p>
<p> As I said, this offer only lasts until the end of the month, so get it while the getting is good. </p>
<p> One of the best things about having a tablet is that it can take the place of many other, usually not-so-techy, things in our lives. Paper products like newspapers and magazines, for example, are easily replaceable with a simple application. Zinio is a popular newsstand app that aims to take the place of the latter, and while it has only been in the Android Market for a short amount of time, it just received an update that makes it even more desirable. </p>

<p> Earlier today, Android Central caught word that the Epic and Zio would receive an over-the-air (OTA) update to Froyo on February 21, but had nothing more than copied and pasted text from the Sprint system. Fast forward a few hours, and we now have more concrete evidence in the form a screenshots from Sprint's internal system that confirm the update is coming: </p>
<p> The image is courtesy of XDA member bentiger, and confirms his earlier statement that there was a Sprint internal announcement that the updates were rolling out: </p>
<p> I just saw an official release from Sprint Dealer News. </p>
<p> The first two of Sprint's latest three-phone, mid-range lineup are now arriving to various Sprint retailers, such as Best Buy, sprint.com, Wirefly.com, and others. While they aren't the powerhouses that we've gotten used to, the Sanyo Zio and the Samsung Transform are good introductory-level Android devices for people who want to dump their feature phones for smartphones without having to shell out the big bucks. They are joining the ranks of Sprint's other low-to-mid-range phones, such as the Samsung Intercept and the HTC Hero. </p>
<p> Assuming this leaked image is real, Sprint has got two new Android devices in store for its customers, although one of them is hardly new at all: the Kyocera Zio, which will be branded as the Sanyo Zio, and the Samsung Transform, which appears to be another Android device, perhaps even from the Galaxy S series. </p>
<p> The Zio probably won't fire anybody up; it was announced last March, and even then it was considered a mid-range phone. </p>
<p> Fresh off the press, i.e. the first day of the CTIA Wireless 2010 trade show, Kyocera announced its return into the smartphone business with, as you already guessed, a new Android device - the Zio M6000. </p>

<p> Total Commander (or Windows Commander back in the 90s) is one of the best-known orthodox file managers out there and made the jump to Android back in 2012 (check out our hands-on for some nostalgia). Version 2 followed soon after in the same year, and apart from a visual update to make it fit better within Holo and Material Design, the basic interface has been the same up until today. Version 3,0, which has been in beta since 2018, doesn't change that, but at least it packs a slew of new features compared to Total Commander 2.91. </p>
<p> Google Assistant was introduced at Google I/O last year, as a more personal voice assistant than Google Now. Since then, it has been made available on several platforms - Pixel phones, the Google Home, Android TV, and Allo. But Assistant is still unavailable on non-Pixel phones without a special build.prop tweak. Now the Open GApps team has made enabling Assistant a little easier. </p>
<p> In part two of our series on manually flashing OTAs to Android Wear devices, we're going to take a look at the Asus ZenWatch. </p>
<p> Prerequisites </p>
<p> Before beginning, make sure you have the following: </p>
<p> The latest Google USB driver and platform tools, both of which can be installed via the Android SDK. </p>
<p> The OTA ZIP file that you want to flash. </p>
<p> How To Flash </p>
<p> Go into the Settings app on your watch, then scroll down to "About," and tap on it. </p>
<p> Scroll down to the build number and repeatedly tap on it until you see a toast notification telling you that you are now a developer. </p>
<p> Veteran Android users, particularly those who stick to Nexus devices, are well aware of the fact that you can usually flash OTA updates manually once someone pulls a link to the actual update file. This normally provides a much better option than waiting for your device to get the update sent to it, which could take weeks. Android Wear has this functionality as well, but each watch is a little different in terms of proper procedures for doing so. We're going to run a series of posts on how to manually flash updates to each Android Wear device that supports it (sorry, Moto 360 users) in the hopes of providing some clarity on the issue. </p>
<p> If you went to Google I/O 2014, you probably treasure the ADT-1, the first Android TV set-top box that was never made available for retail purchase. It's also the first Android TV device to be updated to version 5.0.2... out of an admittedly limited field at the moment. LRX22G contains a few small changes to the core of the system for a few easy performance improvements, but nothing dramatic, so don't sweat it if you aren't part of the initial OTA rollout. </p>
<p> If you just can't wait, here's the OTA ZIP file - you'll need an unmodified ADT-1 and a PC to flash the file with via the ADB interface. </p>
<p> The OnePlus One is receiving another OTA today - one I'm probably more excited about than any other OTA the company has released so far. Mostly because unlocking the phone and using apps has deteriorated into a constant battle with an unresponsive and very moody touchscreen. Supposedly, this update should resolve this pretty major flaw, along with a few other things which I've detailed below, including the poor battery life we covered recently. </p>
<p> Of course, as usual, we have the OTA file for those of you who don't want to wait for the slow rollout to hit them. </p>
<p> There's a reason major device updates tend to roll out in stages. Some of the earlier recipients of the OnePlus One's big July OTA were hit with a bug where the PIN unlock screen did not display properly. OnePlus hasn't wasted any time hopping on this issue, and they're now pushing out a hotfix to the limited people who received the first OTA already and those who have flashed manually. </p>
<p> This update is so small that the version number remains the same, XNPH30O. Below we've shared the files for people who already downloaded the July update, as well as the full OTA zip for people who haven't updated yet and want to do everything in one go. </p>
<p> The fashionably late July over-the-air update for the OnePlus One that bumps the handset up to Android 4.4.4 is beginning to roll out as of now and will continue through the end of the week (it's staged, with 10% rolling out first). In addition to new versions of Google apps, the update contains a cooler calibration for its screen and fixes that stop the phone from activating off-screen gestures while in your pocket. </p>
<p> There's also a new Clear Image camera feature that stitches together over 10 individual photos to produce an image with a higher resolution. Here is a comparison shot with the photo of interest positioned on the right. </p>
<p> The CyanDelta Updater app now has support for Paranoid Android, so users of that ROM can join the likes of their CyanogenMod or OmniROM running peers in avoiding that beefy ROM update each night. Keeping up with the nightly Joneses typically requires downloading a sizable update daily, but CyanDelta addresses this situation by only pulling down delta files, which contain just the part of each update that has actually changed. The premise is simple: why download an entire ROM each day if you can simply get what's new? </p>
<p> To dive in, you must first download the .zip file for whichever ROM you want to run (as long as it's CyanogenMod, OmniRom, or Paranoid Android). </p>
<p> While the majority of Nexus and GPE devices have received their Android 4.4.3 OTAs relatively quickly, the rollout for certain other devices has certainly been... unusual. We still haven't heard anything about the 2013 Nexus 7 LTE, the LG G Pad 8.3 GPE, or the Moto G GPE, and until today, the OTA for the 2012 Nexus 7 Wi-Fi (I've been waiting for it to post both Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi+3G links together). </p>
<p> As they say, better late than never, but I'm sure owners of the abovementioned phones and tablets are not thrilled, especially those with Nexus 7s LTE that have received neither factory images nor OTAs. </p>

<p> zipcar </p>
<p> It has been about a month since we first mentioned that car rental company Zipcar was working on an Android app, and the first beta has now arrived. With this app you'll be able to find and rent a car directly from your Android device, but that's not all - it will also allow you to lock/unlock the doors and honk the horn. That last part may seem like a bit of a novelty, but you have to admit that it's still pretty rad. </p>
<p> According to its Twitter account, car rental company Zipcar appear to be working on an Android app. This is pretty good news for Android owners out there that use Zipcar for their transportation needs, as an iOS app has been available for quite some time. </p>
<p> That means you'll be able to find a Zipcar, book it, and unlock it - all with your Android phone. If you live in San Francisco or another big Zipcar town, you'll know just how useful this will be. </p>

<p> zizo </p>
<p> It's insane how case manufacturers want to charge consumers for a simple phone case. OtterBox, for instance, wants a whopping $60 for a Defender, a case that isn't even out yet for LG's new V30. But if you like saving a ton of money and still want a tough MIL-STD 810.1G-compliant product, look no further than Zizo's BOLT, STATIC, and ION cases for the V30. Each of the three cases offers great value, and at least one is bound to fit your needs. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Note8 is really expensive. $900 is quite a lot of money, especially for something as fragile as a smartphone. One drop could mean the end of your shiny new device, or at least a very expensive repair job. Thankfully, Zizo makes some fantastic cases for the Note8 (they're even available on Amazon), and we're giving away 30 of their Zizo BOLT cases! </p>
<p> As you all know, the Galaxy Note8 is not a cheap phone. $900+ is a sizable chunk of cash for anyone, and it would really suck to damage such a pricey device in a fall because you are using a cheap, crappy case, or - gasp - going naked. Note 8 buyers, don't let this happen to you; get yourself a great case from Zizo. They've got four excellent options to choose from in the BOLT, ION, ATOM, and STATIC. Three of them even come with a tempered glass screen protector designed to fit perfectly with the case. </p>

<p> Z Launcher </p>
<p> Nokia's Z Launcher is a bit different. Instead of a customizable homescreen where you place your app icons, it chooses them based on the ones you often open and you're most likely to need right now. Essentially, it adapts to your context. It has a few more tricks too, like scribbling the names of apps, contacts, and websites to launch them directly. In its new update, this scribble function is about to get a little more powerful. </p>
<p> Scribbling now supports synonyms, so you can launch music apps by simply writing music. Spotify, Pandora, and even YouTube should appear in the list of options. </p>
<p> Earlier this year, Nokia surprised everyone by developing an interesting Android app called Z Launcher. Back then, it was only available for beta participants as an APK download on Nokia's website. Today, along with its Android N1 tablet announcement at Slush 2014, the company has revealed that Z Launcher is making its official debut on the Play Store. </p>
<p> If you haven't tried Z Launcher before, you should think of it as Yahoo's Aviate with Google Gesture Search running on top. Basically, Z Launcher doesn't just work as a regular homescreen replacement where you organize your apps and widgets in a static layout. Instead, it will look for patterns in your behavior throughout the day, including the apps you launch, the people you call, and the websites you browse, and surface them to you to anticipate your needs. </p>

<p> zoe </p>
<p> Zoes are little video highlights that are similar to GIFs but tend to be longer, so don't call them that. The functionality launched as an HTC exclusive back in the days of the original HTC One. Then things opened up to other devices as the manufacturer expanded Zoe into a social network of sorts. Along the way some things changed, like the ability to create Zoes locally. </p>
<p> Well, Zoe 2.0 is now available in the Play Store, and it lets you create things on your device rather than using the cloud again. But, and this is a pretty decent but, you can only create Zoes locally on HTC devices. </p>
<p> HTC Zoe is a social network of sorts built around video highlights. According to the latest update's changelog, the app now works on devices running the latest version of Google's mobile operating system, including the Nexus 6 and the Nexus 9. Here it is on my updated HTC One M7. </p>
<p> That's not all this release has in store. The list of changes includes a new highlight engine that enables new themes, effects, and transitions. It also brings in support for higher-quality video, and you're able to download your own high-definition Zoes to your device.The discovery feed has apparently retrieved a tweak or two, but overall, the experience still looks largely the same. </p>
<p> During its Double Exposure event yesterday, HTC announced that it was bringing Zoe out of beta and expanding it to all Android devices running Android 4.3 or higher. It also intends to bring the service to the iPhone later this fall. The company clearly has large plans for something that began as a camera perk exclusively available on a small number of its devices. Zoe has become a social network, and HTC wants as many people to use it as possible. </p>
<p> Zoe began as the ability to take a series of photos in rapid succession and string them together into short videos that resembled animated GIFs. </p>
<p> HTC has just updated the Zoe app in Google Play with support for a few non-HTC phones, but support will supposedly expand soon. The Zoe app isn't the same as HTC's Zoe camera feature in the HTC One, but it might still be interesting if you're down with making and sharing videos. </p>

<p> zoho </p>
<p> Teams have to communicate and for many situations, email isn't cutting it. Real time chat is how many of the most effective groups collaborate, but the right software can make a huge difference. This is where Zoho Cliq comes in with its user-friendly interface, laundry list of features, and numerous integrations. </p>
<p> Turning visits to your company's website into conversions isn't easy, no matter how good of a match you are for your potential customers. You need to keep people engaged, anticipate their interests and questions, and give them what they need before they move on to the next option. </p>
<p> Zoho's SalesIQ is an easy to use, yet very full-featured service that brings analytics, real-time user tracking, and live chat into one coherent dashboard that integrates with numerous other services you may already be using. Even better, you can make use of these features from the SalesIQ Android app, too. </p>
<p> Zoho isn't shy about its new app's target. Right there, at the bottom of Notebook's official product page, is a clear message saying, "Looking for an alternative to Evernote?" There's even a whole page dedicated to comparing side-by-side shots of Notebook and Evernote and telling everyone that although Notebook doesn't have everything now, it's on the right track. </p>
<p> So what exactly does Notebook have? Notebooks, ha! Obvious joke aside, you can create text notes, images, audio notes, and checklists. Then change their main color, group them into notebooks with assigned cover images, reorder them, move them to another notebook, search them, and share them over email or SMS. </p>
<p> Despite what many people think, Google Docs is not the only online-based office suite. In fact, some may say that a few of the others - like Zoho Office, for example - are even more full-featured than GDocs. </p>
<p> If you've been thinking about leaving El Goog behind and jumping over to Zoho's house, but the lack of an Android app has been the deciding factor that kept you from making the leap, we have good news: ZOHO Docs is finally available on Android. </p>
<p> ZDocs looks strikingly like to GDocs, which should aid in making the transition into the new home for all of your on-the-go office needs a quick and easy one. </p>
<p> We're all used to using our phones to spend money. Whether you're buying the latest game, a cool app or an additional purchase within an app, smartphones cost us lots of money. It's pretty refreshing, then, to see Zoho: an application which helps you make money from your phone by invoicing clients on the move. </p>
<p> Zoho is a cloud based service which offers its users lots of tools such as business email, customer tracking, and document collaboration. If you use Zoho, you'll be glad to know that it has just made the jump over from the iPhone to Android. It's free to use if you're only invoicing 5 people or less every month, but let's be honest, if you're only invoicing 5 people or less every month then you need to stop worrying about Zoho and start worrying about making money from your business. </p>
<p> Apparently Motorola is in the middle of a site redesign. Exciting, right? Pff... no. But the contents that were discovered because of said site redesign... now that's pretty exciting. PocketNow has acquired some images of the new site that display some upcoming Moto devices, including the XOOM 2, a couple of new handsets, and, curiously enough, a watch. </p>
<p> Let's start off with the new phones: the Slimline and the Zaha (shown above, respectively). First off, we have absolutely zero information on this pair, aside from the fact that they look super clean and thin. It's probably pretty likely that these are just codenames as well, so I wouldn't expect to walk in to your provider looking for them by these names in the foreseeable future. </p>

<p> Uber spent 2019 shedding its loss-making businesses and laying off staff on a global scale in a bid to become profitable. The latest to get the ax is the Indian arm of Uber Eats, which has been sold to the local rival Zomato. Uber Eats ceased all of its operations in the Asian market earlier today, following a blog post by Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal. </p>
<p> Taking an Uber is already a much more enticing option than hailing a cab. One of the things that makes it so great is that it's so amazingly convenient. Uber is almost everywhere, and you can get a lift without having cash on you, or even knowing the local language. All you need is a smartphone. </p>
<p> Now it's about to get even better. Uber is allowing other sites and apps to introduce their own branding and functionality into the core Uber experience, provided the user was directed to it through a deep link or ride reminder. </p>
<p> Uber has already quietly signed up a number of big names, with more undoubtedly to follow. </p>
<p> There's money to be made in the restaurant recommendation business. Yelp makes bank by enabling users to point other users towards good places to eat and other local establishments. Urbanspoon made a name for itself over the years doing something similar. Recently, the latter attracted the attention of Zomato, an India-based company with a presence in Asia, Europe, and South America. </p>
<p> Zomato announced on its blog today that it has acquired Urbanspoon, which will help it expand into the US, Canada, and Australia. This should also improve its efforts in the UK, New Zealand, and Ireland, where there was already some overlap. </p>

<p> N3V Games dropped Dead on Arrival 2 in the Play Store last week, but they made the game exclusively available in their native Australia and neighbor New Zealand. They announced that they would roll the game out globally on September 23rd, and while it may now be two days later, we can't blame them for giving their peeps a few extra days of exclusive playtime. Still, that time's up, so everyone else can now pick up their trusty firearm of choice. </p>
<p> The inevitable Zombie apocalypse has begun again, but for the time being, the outbreak is quarantined to Australia and New Zealand. Developers N3V Games are proud to work Down Under and are giving gamers in both countries a week of exclusive quality time with the title before launching the game elsewhere on September 23. In the meantime, Dead on Arrival 2 is available for all to see in the Play Store. </p>
<p> You're cruising the skies in a helicopter, when tragedy strikes. The chopper goes down and everyone dies. Literally, everyone. Except you. You awake in a new world. A world filled with the undead... and they're everywhere. There's nothing to do but run. For your life. </p>
<p> That's essentially the tone set for Into the Dead, a new first-person endless runner that just hit the Play Store. The game is quite popular on the iOS side of things, and for good reason – it looks amazing. </p>
<p> Yesterday, we got an eyeful of NVIDIA's new Tegra 4 and Tegra 4i, along with the Phoenix, NVIDIA's nifty reference device. The benchmarks were quite impressive compared to current-generation processors, but all we got to see in terms of gaming performance was a brief demo of Real Boxing. </p>
<p> In a video posted today to NVIDIA's YouTube channel, the chip maker shows off a "Tegra 4 enhanced Zombie Driver," side by side with the same game running on a "non-Tegra 4" device. </p>
<p> Before now, I thought that zombies had been added to every conceivable genre with the possible exception of farm implement simulator, and that's only a matter of time. But surprisingly, adding undead minions to a game that millions of office workers use to cling to sanity turns out to be fairly interesting. Despite the title, zombies don't replace mines in Zombie Minesweeper, they just add to the explosive fun. Check out the trailer below. </p>
<p> Minecraft - Pocket Edition may have one of the slowest development timelines around. Of course, the main reason we accept this almost Valve-ian wait is because every time we do get an update, it brings awesome stuff like friggin' Zombie Pigmen. Oh yeah, and the Nether Reactor that summons them, which is exclusive to the Pocket Edition. Heck yes. </p>
<p> The update also brings a few other new features, like paintings and mushroom farming. </p>
<p> There's no such thing as too many zombies, right? That seems to have been Glu Mobile's general idea when bringing Call of Duty: Black Ops – Zombies (or CODBOZ) to Android. The game, which itself is based on a spin-off of the original Call of Duty series, puts CoD players in familiar territory with a seemingly endless stream of zombies to eliminate in a game spanning not only multiple environments, but multiple gameplay modes as well. </p>
<p> The Men Who Wear Many Hats may have struck undead gold with their debut entry into Google's Play Store. Organ Trail is pretty much what it sounds like – a take on the classic nostalgia-fest that is the Oregon Trail, but with zombies, bandits, and an upgradeable station wagon. The game, which started on the web, hit Android recently, delivering the same epic experience players of the original would expect. </p>
<p> Once in a while, an Angry Birds or Temple Run comes along in the mobile gaming sphere. Games that are able to hook you with their simple but endlessly entertaining mechanics, and an ability to immediately "dive in" to the game at any time, even if for just 5 minutes (or 3 hours). </p>
<p> The problem with those games is that they're generally aimed at an audience that has never played video games, or has but doesn't actually love them. </p>
<p> Glu Mobile (makers of Bonsai Blast and a slew of other games) has treated Android users to another gem, combining powerful samurai, devilish zombies, and a stylized, adorable art style to make Samurai vs Zombies Defense. </p>
<p> Samurai vs Zombies is reminiscent of tower defense-style games, centering each level around defending a gate. Instead of simply setting up turrets and guns, however, SvZ allows players to go mobile, running toward packs of zombies and attacking them with typical sword swipes or special powerups. </p>

<p> I've never understood why shotguns are the go-to weapon for fending off zombie hordes. Sure, in a close encounter, it's a guaranteed way to put a bloodthirsty undead drone on its backside, but it's not going to liberate an entire city in the event of an outbreak. Such large-scale crowd control needs more than pseudo-vigilante justice. That's why, unless every air force base in the world were to succumb to a zombie outbreak at the same time, I would expect to see an AC-130 bringing the rain from the skies. </p>

<p> zombie driver </p>
<p> A review of Exor Studio's Zombie Driver is somewhat redundant, since it's been available on PCs via Steam for almost three years. But as any dedicated mobile gamer knows, translating a console or PC gaming experience to a handheld is rarely as straightforward as developers or publishers think, and the $7 asking price is a respectable chunk of change, even for a proven game. So, does the NVIDIA-published THD version of Zombie Driver live up to its undead-slaying progenitor? </p>
<p> In the spirit of Halloween, let's give some stuff away! It's about treats after all - isn't it? And what better treat is there than free gadgets? </p>
<p> Since this is a Halloween giveaway, let's talk about the undead for a moment, shall we? In fact, let's get specific - let's talk about killing the undead with an assault vehicle made for mowing 'em down. Sound familiar? It should, because I'm talking about the newly released Tegra-exclusive title Zombie Driver. </p>

<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a delightful real-time strategy game with an upfront cost, a space adventure game all about mining moons, a turn-based strategy RPG in beta, a zombie survival game, a casual naval strategy game, a kawaii-themed city smasher, and a card-based dungeon crawler. </p>
<p> Back in April Rocketcat Games announced that Death Road to Canada was finally coming to Android. After a 6-month wait, it would appear that it's officially landed on the Play Store with a price tag of $9.99, a whole $5 cheaper than its PC counterpart. You can expect all of the same pixel-based zombie killing gameplay where you are tasked with managing a car full of jerks as they venture forward to the zombie-free Great White North. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we have a new Kairosoft management game, two different space shooters, a casual soccer title, an unconventional tower defense game, a rope-swinging endless runner, and a zombie game (of course). Without further ado: </p>
<p> Skyforce Unite! </p>
<p> When you read the words "zombie-themed base-builder," some of the more hilariously awful games on the Play Store come to mind, including this classic gem of wanton intellectual property theft. But don't close the tab just yet: Rebuild 3 is a zombie of a different off-green hue. First of all, it comes from developer Northway Games, which made such unique titles as Inredipede and Deep Under the Sky. Second, it's a premium $5 title with no in-app purchases, which is more than you can say for the vast majority of both builder and zombie games for Android. </p>
<p> Look, I love zombies as much as the next guy (assuming he actually loves zombies - if he doesn't, then I actually love zombies more than the next guy). I also love zombies games. Here's the problem: good zombies games are hard to find on basically any platform. I realize that they're not all going to be The Last of Us - especially on mobile - but I'd like to see something different every once in a while. </p>
<p> While we've seen endless runners with zombies before, Corridor Z is a little bit different. It's still an endless runner. It still has zombies. </p>
<p> Madfinger's Dead Trigger 2 has remained near the top of the game charts on Android since its release a couple of months ago, and the developers continue to update it regularly. The last update focused on balance issues, but this one adds the most content yet, most notably the new China environment. This addition includes new Story and Warfare missions and extra challenges, plus Google Play Games achievements. </p>
<p> You also get several handfuls of melee weapons for when you inevitably run out of ammo and/or chickens. The Big Hammer and Butterfly Swords seem like they'll be the most fun, but Danny Trejo fans can also cause a little carnage with the Machete. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got an impressively atmospheric survival horror game, a game that mixes Peggle and Angry Birds, and a game that's way too indie for you, man. Without further ado: </p>
<p> Dark Project </p>
<p> Survival horror games are a bit under-represented on Android, but Dark Project seems to hit all the high points of the genre. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a new Tin Man game book, a Disney endless runner, a modern take on Space Harrier, and a zombie game that might actually be worth a look. Without further ado: </p>
<p> Gary Chalk's Gun Dogs </p>
<p> Another week (or so), another Choose Your Own Adventure-style RPG book from Tin Man Games. </p>
<p> There's been a glut of zombie games lately - nary a roundup goes by where I don't have to try and find something new to say about the oh-so-popular undead. But Zombie Driver, the rare mixture of top-down driving and survival horror, comes by it honestly. The indie game was released on Steam for the PC back in 2009, and has been a popular seller on various platforms ever since. Now the THD version is available to owners of Tegra-based phones and tablets for $6.99. </p>
<p> If you haven't stumbled across Zombie Driver before, think of it as a mix between the Carmageddon and Twisted Metal games of old and the newer top-down racers that seem to do so well on mobile. </p>
<p> Once in a while, an Angry Birds or Temple Run comes along in the mobile gaming sphere. Games that are able to hook you with their simple but endlessly entertaining mechanics, and an ability to immediately "dive in" to the game at any time, even if for just 5 minutes (or 3 hours). </p>
<p> The problem with those games is that they're generally aimed at an audience that has never played video games, or has but doesn't actually love them. This "casual gamer" is a mass market holy grail that many game developers are now trying to tap into. As a result, there are very few great games on any mobile platform that I would classify as being directed toward gamers, somewhat ironically. </p>

<p> Zombie gunship </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a retro revival, a sickeningly cute jumping game, an appealing escape title, and a Flappy Bird clone with zombies. </p>
<p> Limbic has released Zombie Gunship Reality onto Google Play, a game that pretty much no one is able to play at the moment. It's available exclusively for Project Tango, an augmented reality project that has yet to ship on a device intended for general consumers. Unless there's an announcement in the works, one isn't intended for quite some time. </p>
<p> Zombie Gunship Reality takes the popular Zombie Gunship franchise and gives it the Tango treatment, requiring players to move around a physical space in order to find and fire upon the hordes of undead threatening the area below. </p>
<p> We've hit that point in the life of every Humble Bundle where a new set of games jump in to flesh out the original selection. This time around, we're seeing the likes of Epoch, Mikey Hooks, and Zombie Gunship join the seven games that made up the initial batch. People who paid over the average at the time of purchase will get these new titles automatically, and those who do so going forward will get them just as well. </p>
<p> Normally when we see one of these pay-what-you-want Android game bundles, they come to us from the good ol' reliable Humble Bundle folks. This time around, we're looking at a package of games available from StackSocial. </p>
<p> There are seven games total, though you have to beat the average to get more than two of them. It currently sits at just over $4, but it's sure to rise over the course of the next thirteen days. </p>
<p> It's that time again. Another bundle of games has hit the web courtesy of the Humble Bundle folks, and as always, they're charging the sweet price of whatever-you-feel-like-paying. There are six games up for grabs this time around, with two requiring you to pay over the average. </p>
<p> Regardless how much you pay, the Humble Bundle will let you walk out with a digital version of the popular board game Catan ($3.99), the jetski racer Riptide GP2 ($2.99), the parkour simulator Vector ($0.99), and that game where you shoot zombies from the comfort of an AC-130 gunship - Zombie Gunship ($0.99). </p>
<p> I've never understood why shotguns are the go-to weapon for fending off zombie hordes. Sure, in a close encounter, it's a guaranteed way to put a bloodthirsty undead drone on its backside, but it's not going to liberate an entire city in the event of an outbreak. Such large-scale crowd control needs more than pseudo-vigilante justice. That's why, unless every air force base in the world were to succumb to a zombie outbreak at the same time, I would expect to see an AC-130 bringing the rain from the skies. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/zombies-run/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549162" filename="zombies-run">
<p> zombies run! </p>
<p> Finding the motivation to put on your running shoes and get out to the street and, worse, start running can be tough. Zombies, Run! makes it fun by providing a back story and a "reason" for your run: Zombies are chasing you and your survival depends on running. It's thrilling and different enough that it could be the thing you need to start running and keep doing it every day. You might even get so passionate about it that you'd participate in the app's virtual races where you compete with real runners around the world. </p>
<p> Now the team behind Zombies, Run! is releasing a standalone app for these virtual races, but it's aimed at brands and charities. </p>
<p> Admit it, Glass owners, half the reason you're going to Google I/O is that you want to chat with other Glass people about how cool Glass is (hashtag throughglass). Google has given you plenty to chat about: they've just thrown a dozen new apps into the Glassware gallery, all of them from notable sources. Probably the most interesting is Livestream, the official app for Livestream.com, which was previously available as a side-load install. </p>
<p> Clockwise from left: Livestream, Duolingo, MusiXmatch, Star Chart, The Guardian, and Zombies Run! </p>
<p> Other possibly useful additions include a Glassified version of the Duolingo language learning app, a really cool take on the augmented reality Star Chart app, heads-up versions of the Runtastic and Zombies Run! </p>
<p> The premise behind Zombies, Run! is pretty simple - there are some zombies, and you're probably not going to want them to catch you. Fire up the app, stick some earbuds into your ear, and run. No, run! You typically don't spend too much time looking at your phone while using this app, but (wait, why did you stop moving, run!) the new update to version 3.0 will make sure the app looks holorific the next time you do. </p>
<p> Before. </p>
<p> After. </p>
<p> Developers Six to Start know users don't have all that much time to look at the app while they're running, so it's included a new wave of something other than zombies. </p>
<p> Six to Start's latest app is another pedometer for people who need more motivation to get off the couch. Similar to the team's previous game, Zombies, Run!, The Walk is an immersive experience that pits players in the midst of a suspenseful storyline - but rather than tap and swipe at the screen to make progress, you must get on your feet and move. It hopes to change your next walk around town into an adventure you will never forget. </p>
<p> The game begins with a bomb exploding in Inverness station and you being handed a package that could save the world. </p>
<p> Few things motivate me to run more than the threat of disembodied zombies pursuing me through city streets. For a while now, escaping the undead has felt dull and repetitive, as if I'm just going through the same motions over and over again. Fortunately, Six to Start is back with a brand new season of Zombies, Run! Fans of the fitness game have been eagerly awaiting a new chapter almost as fervently as Walking Dead watchers crave their favorite AMC hit. </p>
<p> For owners of the app, this update brings a refreshed look to the UI, revamps the base-building experience, and adds seven new missions to the storyline. </p>
<p> How far we've come since the early days of running from zombies! Why, back in my day, if we wanted to be chased by hordes of the undead, we had to actually get out of the house and run around, since GPS was the only supported method for keeping track of our progress. Now, however, the app that's designed to get you working out by forcing you to flee for your life has added accelerometer support, so treadmill runners can get in on the action. Nifty! </p>
<p> In addition to accelerometer mode, there is also a bit of new content. </p>
<p> Several weeks ago, Zombies, Run! gave our own Eric Ravenscraft a much-needed trip outside the house while he reviewed the unique workout/game hybrid. After using the application for several days, he came away impressed with it, though questioned its $8 price tag. If you share his sentiments, now may be the time to splurge and grab the download, as the price is down to just $3 until tomorrow. </p>
<p> For those who may not already know, Zombies, Run! is a unique application that turns your tired old running routine into a game of apocalyptic survival. Plug in your headphones, hit play, and start running - the app will be in charge of immersing you in a world filled with the undead. </p>

<p> The Tegra Zone is set to get one more amazing game next month, with the minimalist strategy game Auralux coming down the pipe. Auralux, which promises to have "every feature and more from the renowned PC game," combines the minimalist, otherworldly environment/music of Osmos with the real-time galactic strategy of Galcon for what looks to be a stunning experience. </p>
<p> Describing itself as "an abstract, essentialized, and simplified real-time strategy game," Auralux gives players individual units, each of which can only carry out one type of command. </p>
<p> Those who know me or follow me on Google+ know that I love Mass Effect. Actually, that may be a bit of an understatement; I've had 4 characters that played every single mission and side-mission in both the first and second game, and I just finished the trilogy a few days ago. And now, I have a new way to show my love: with a new Mass Effect 3 live wallpaper (LWP) from NVIDIA and BioWare. </p>
<p> Any time a new game shows up in NVIDIA's TegraZone, we immediately hop on to take a look - after all, only the best of the best games with gorgeous graphics make it that far. </p>
<p> The newest addition to TegraZone this time around is Meltdown On Mars THD - it's what I would call a mix of tower defense and Gun Bros, executed in a way kind of similar to Dungeon Defenders. </p>
<p> The Android Police giveaway fever continues, but this time we've stepped things up with a triple header. Once again, we've teamed up with NVIDIA to give away three Motorola Photon 4Gs. Why? Because NVIDIA and Tegra Zone are awesome. </p>
<p> The Prizes </p>
<p> As I myself have discovered in the past few weeks, the Photon is a great phone that packs some serious power under the hood: </p>
<p> 1 GB DDR2 RAM </p>
<p> 4.3" qHD (960 x 540) display </p>
<p> 8MP camera with dual LED flash, 720p video capture in the rear, VGA front-facing camera </p>
<p> 16GB memory + microSD slot </p>
<p> HDMI Mirroring </p>
<p> Kickstand </p>
<p> 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi </p>
<p> Before we move on to the giveaway, I wanted to mention our awesome sponsor, NVIDIA, once again. </p>

<p> Zoom has seen incredible growth this year and has become one of the most popular video conferencing platforms around. This success has been aided by regular updates that bring useful new features. The latest Zoom update addresses a major security concern, finally adding support for end-to-end encryption (E2EE). </p>
<p> Google's latest, greatest Pixel phone is really only one of those things—after catching flack for the poor value of the Pixel 4, Google scaled back on the Pixel 5. Gone are features like Face Match, Ambient EQ, and perhaps most importantly, the telephoto camera. Instead, the Pixel 5 has a wide/ultrawide combo, and some people might prefer that. However, it's a disadvantage if you want to take photos of things from a distance. </p>
<p> Smart displays have taken off in the last couple of years. Even Facebook got in on the game with the launch of the Portal in 2018. The company refreshed the Portal product line last year, introducing new products like Portal TV. Now Portal is getting a bit more useful thanks to additions like Zoom and Netflix. </p>
<p> Google has been working hard on Meet, its video conferencing tool, in an effort to compete with other platforms like Zoom. The company published a roadmap of upcoming features last month, and today it announced that the rollout for two of these features will be starting next week — but only for certain users. </p>
<p> Zoom has grown to become one of the most popular videoconferencing apps, boosted by a sudden need to virtually keep in touch with close ones, co-workers, and clients during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the app's most popular features is the ability to add a virtual background, which is a nice way of keeping a modicum of privacy, especially when working from home. Sadly, this particular feature was not available on Android, but a new update just brought the functionality along with a bunch of other useful ones to our handheld devices. </p>
<p> The onset of COVID-19 caused a rapid growth in demand for video conferencing apps, as school classes and office meetings everywhere went virtual. Google Meet and Google Duo added support for group video calls on smart displays earlier this summer, but now another popular contender is poised to join the club: Zoom will be available on smart displays from Google, Facebook, and Amazon later this year. </p>
<p> Zoom has understandably been one of the most popular apps around these last few months as people have had to forgo in-person meetings — both personal and business — for online video chats. The desktop client has had a dark mode for a little while now, but Android users have had to suffer blinding menu screens before jumping into late-night calls. With the latest update, Zoom for Android finally gets dark mode and a few others new features to boot. </p>
<p> Ever since the coronavirus pandemic struck, Zoom has been taking over the world of video conferencing. Many other companies have realized that and have started offering or improving their own video calling services — see Google Meet, Duo, Microsoft Teams, and others. Indian telecommunications company Reliance Jio also wants a slice of the cake and has launched its own approach to video conferencing, JioMeet. </p>
<p> Following its unprecedented rise to popularity during the coronavirus pandemic, Zoom quickly found itself under scrutiny from privacy and security experts for not offering end-to-end encryption, among other issues. The company reacted by promising to add the security feature, but for paid users only. After some press backlash regarding that decision, Zoom has now announced that it will bring end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to everyone. </p>

<p> While you'd think that the world's webcam supply chain would have caught up with demand from the many millions of folks working from home by now, you'd be wrong. Logitech is still sold out of every model it makes online, and questionable cheap webcams popping up here and there on Amazon probably aren't a wise investment. But you do have a professional webcam at home, you just may have forgotten about it: your smartphone. With a few simple gadgets, you make your phone into a pro videoconferencing rig in a snap, and be the envy of everyone at the virtual office. </p>

<p> With social distancing becoming the norm during the Coronavirus pandemic, it's certainly added a new chapter in how we communicate. Zoom is one of those particular tools that folks defaulted to because it was already on their work computer. The good news is that it's an excellent app for video chatting with several people at a time. And if you're logging in from a Chromebook, there are a few ways to install the app. </p>
<p> Note that since these are not the desktop versions of Zoom, they're not as full-featured as their Mac and PC counterparts. </p>
<p> It appears Google continues to take action against the 1-star ratings being given to the Zoom app, as its rating continues to climb as the days go on.. It's now back up to a nearly-respectable 4.0, compared to a low of 2.0 when we originally reported on this story. </p>

<p> Zoom has seen incredible growth this year and has become one of the most popular video conferencing platforms around. This success has been aided by regular updates that bring useful new features. The latest Zoom update addresses a major security concern, finally adding support for end-to-end encryption (E2EE). </p>
<p> So far, Zoom meetings have been encrypted, but the encryption keys are stored on Zoom's servers. Thankfully Zoom has been working on adding end-to-end support, and it's available now, although several features won't work when it's active. </p>
<p> When using E2EE, users will temporarily lose support for cloud recording, streaming, live transcription, breakout rooms, polling, 1:1 private chat, join-before-host, and meeting reactions. Zoom describes this as phase 1 of 4, so hopefully these features will be compatible as we reach the later phases. </p>
<p> If you want to try out E2EE, you'll need to enable it in your account settings and switch it on for each meeting. Keep in mind that the other participants won't be able to join the meeting if the feature isn't enabled on their account. </p>
<p> The encryption algorithm is the same as Zoom already used. The only difference is where the keys are stored with E2EE — no longer with Zoom. </p>
<p> As well as security enhancements, the latest update includes plenty of new features. YouTube livestreaming is now available on mobile and users can change the ringtone for different types of calls. </p>
<p> The update is rolling out now through the Play Store, or you can grab it at APK Mirror. </p>

<p> Google's latest, greatest Pixel phone is really only one of those things—after catching flack for the poor value of the Pixel 4, Google scaled back on the Pixel 5. Gone are features like Face Match, Ambient EQ, and perhaps most importantly, the telephoto camera. Instead, the Pixel 5 has a wide/ultrawide combo, and some people might prefer that. However, it's a disadvantage if you want to take photos of things from a distance. </p>
<p> We've got six sets of photos, three indoors and three outdoor, taken on the Pixel 4 and Pixel 5. Each set includes a 2x, 4x, and 6x zoom shot. On the Pixel 5, these are all taken with the main camera and cropped with magical AI technology. The Pixel 4 uses its 2x optical zoom module to boost the clarity, and you can tell the difference in a lot of images. However, the Pixel 5 holds its own surprisingly well, particularly inside where the Pixel 4's narrower aperture hurts it. </p>
<p> Note, all sliders have Pixel 4 on the left and Pixel 5 on the right. </p>
<p> Indoors </p>
<p> One thing of note about the indoor shots; the Pixel 5 pics are a bit brighter. That's because the Pixel 4's telephoto camera has a narrower f/2.4 aperture vs. the primary camera's f/1.7. The Pixel 5 uses that module for all zoom shots, unlike the Pixel 4. Last year's phone sticks with the main sensor for indoor shots without sufficient light, but we've made sure our samples were all taken with the telephoto. Predictably, the Pixel 4 can extract more detail, which is particularly noticeable at 6x. The Pixel does an admirable job at 2x and 4x, helped by the larger aperture, but the images look a bit unnatural to me. </p>
<p> Outdoors </p>
<p> The differences are more noticeable in the outdoor shots as there's more light to compensate for the Pixel 4's narrower telephoto aperture. The 2x zoom shots are still a bit of a toss-up (which is impressive photo processing for the Pixel 5), but there's a definite drop in clarity at 4x and especially 6x. Again, the Pixel 4 is on the left of the slider and the Pixel 5 is on the right. </p>
<p> If I had my choice of sensors on the Pixel 5, I'd pick telephoto over ultrawide. While Google's super-res zoom can do some amazing things, it's even better with real optical zoom in the mix. In a perfect world, the Pixel would have wide, ultrawide, and telephoto sensors. Alas, Google isn't great at making high-end phones, and ultrawide sensors are cheaper. </p>

<p> ZTE Axon 20 5G </p>
<p> Although we've seen plenty of concepts and prototypes over the last year or so, ZTE is now technically "first" to reveal a phone with an under-display camera. That's right, the Axon 20 5G has no notch, no camera cutout, and almost no bezel. The front-facing camera can work right through the screen. </p>
<p> Chinese telecom gear manufacturer ZTE hasn’t had a particularly good run in the US smartphone market. But every once in a while, its eccentric phones manage to catch our eye, and frankly, they don't give us much to complain about. ZTE is now coming out with a handset that uses an under-display selfie camera — a first for any mass-produced phone on the market. The Axon 20 5G, succeeding last year’s Axon 10 Pro 5G, is set to debut as soon as early next month. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/zte-axon-7-mini/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17549338" filename="zte-axon-7-mini">
<p> The last time we covered LineageOS, the project had started supporting seven new phones, including the Xperia Z5 Compact and LG K10. Since then, several additional devices have been added to the official build roster. These include the Sony Xperia Z5, Samsung Galaxy S6, and Redmi 3S/3X. </p>
<p> The ZTE Axon 7 has had fairly speedy updates - it received Android 7.0 in February, and 7.1.1 in March. The Axon 7 Mini, on the other hand, has been stuck on 6.0.1 Marshmallow this whole time. ZTE started previewing the Mini's Nougat update in March, and it's finally being rolled out to the masses. </p>
<p> The ZTE Axon 7 Mini, as the name might imply, is a slightly-smaller version of ZTE's Axon 7 with downgraded specifications. The phone has a Snapdragon 617 CPU, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage with microSD expansion (if the second SIM tray isn't being used), and a 2,705mAh non-removable battery. Now you can grab it for just $199.99, $100 off the normal MSRP. </p>

<p> zte axon m </p>
<p> It's official, ZTE's weird, borderline experimental dual-screen Axon M is now available at bargain basement prices. You can now find new 64GB AT&T-compatible Axon M handsets for $250 in the US on eBay, which is roughly 65 percent off the original $725 price tag. </p>
<p> "It's interesting." That's what I heard most often when I would show someone ZTE's bizarre dual-screen phone. </p>
<p> And, inevitably, "Who's it for?" </p>
<p> I never came up with a good answer. The Axon M is unlike any other smartphone on the market. Some people have made a point of likening it to the long-deceased Kyocera Echo, and while it is similar to that phone, the concept has evolved a fair bit. The Axon M is more mature, more considered, and more thoughtful - ZTE clearly spent time thinking about how a dual-screen phone would work, and how to minimize some of (though definitely not all) the pain points it would present. </p>
<p> Foldable phones aren't new. In fact, Kyocera sold one nearly seven years ago on Sprint. It was terrible, but my point is that the concept is not novel, and companies have even gone so far as to make such foldable smartphones commercially available. They've been rare, of course, and probably for a number of very good reasons: they're hard to design, hard to engineer without compromise, expensive to produce, and of questionable utility in general. </p>
<p> ZTE thinks it finally has a foldable phone you'd actually want to buy, though - the new Axon M. Will you actually want to buy it? </p>
<p> Today ZTE has announced the Axon M, a folding phone with dual 1080p displays. There have been a couple of leaks in the past month or two, but now it's official. The Axon M isn't quite the vision of the future we expected from Westworld, but it has some decent specifications to support its unusual design. </p>

<p> zte blade </p>
<p> ZTE doesn't have the glitz and glamor of Samsung, but it sells a surprising number of phones. The company is on-hand at Mobile World Congress to show off its latest devices. There's the Blade V9 (above), which is a run-of-the-mill budget Android phone. Then we have the Tempo Go, which is the first Android Go phone from ZTE. In fact, it'll be the first Android Go phone in the US (although it might have a different name). </p>
<p> The day that many ROM enthusiasts have been dreading has arrived: the CyanogenMod Team has announced the end of life support for the original Nexus One, along with other first-generation Snapdragon devices, including the HTC EVO 4G, [Droid] Incredible and Desire and others. None of these devices have official builds of CyanogenMod 9 (though plenty of independent ROM developers have done their best) and they won't be getting any CM updates beyond the 7.X Gingerbread branch. </p>
<p> The reason is a limitation in the media libraries of most of these devices, as well as a general lack of on-board storage in the second generation of Android hardware. </p>
<p> Having your phone model supported by CyanogenMod's community is quite an honor nowadays, and for many people it's a deciding factor when picking up a new phone. CM usually stays ahead of the curve and is likely to support your phone well after manufacturers and carriers stop showing any interest. </p>
<p> Therefore, ZTE Blade/Orange San Francisco owners should be feeling quite ecstatic right now, as the world's largest ROM community announced its official support of this device (see Cyanogen's commit here). </p>
<p> Download </p>
<p> There are no final builds just yet, but you are free to download and flash the CM7 Release Candidate from here. </p>
<p> Introduction </p>
<p> Since the advent of Android in 2009, the family of devices running Google's mobile OS has grown from one handset to now hundreds and possibly thousands of unique models. In recent months, Android has seen an explosion of devices coming from lesser-known Asian manufacturers, with one of the main selling points being price. The manufacturers realized that with Android they had a readily and freely accessible operating system, a large market of potential customers, and all they had to do was put together a cheap device to capitalize on Android's continued growth. Unfortunately, these devices often cut corners where things mattered the most - poor displays, resistive touchscreens, bad build quality and a litany of other crimes against the gods of consumer electronics. </p>
<p> Here's some great news for owners of the budget flavour-of-the-month, the ZTE Blade. Saddled with Éclair at birth, the dudes over at MoDaCo's ZTE Blade section have given their phones a new lease of life with a Froyo port from the domestic Chinese model to their beloved Orange San Francisco. </p>
<p> The ROM is very much in the Alpha stage right now, but even so it is very exciting news for those of you who have heard of the Blade. For those of you scratching your heads in bewilderment, stay tuned - our ZTE Blade review will be up early next week. </p>
<p> Here's a device that's been making some waves in the UK Android community. Over at MoDaCo.com, founder Paul O'Brien picked up Orange's rebranded ZTE Blade for £99 ($160) with a pre-paid SIM. Judging from his video, it seems that you get quite a lot of device for your money, including that aforementioned 3.5" AMOLED screen. Despite being burdened with a silly name and an abundance of network shovelware, the Blade/SanFran's 600 MHz CPU appears to run Android 2.1 pretty nicely. </p>
<p> As is his wont, Mr O'Brien has cracked the Blade right open, with root being achieved pretty much immediately, and the tantalizing prospect of an AOSP Froyo ROM hanging in the air. </p>

<p> zte flash </p>
<p> Considering the multitude of leaks surrounding the device,, you probably already know basically everything there is to know about the ZTE Flash for Sprint. And now, The Now Network has made this mid-ranger official. The device features some pretty modest specs, along with a very Galaxy Nexus-esque form factor: </p>
<p> We've heard quite a bit about the upcoming ZTE Flash on Sprint over the last couple of weeks, but Best Buy just spilled all the details of the upcoming mid-ranger. According to previous leaks - which have now been confirmed by Best Buy - the Flash has a 4.5-inch 1280x720 display, 1.5GHz dual-core processor, 1GB RAM, and Android 4.0. The handset's claim to fame, however, is its 12.6MP rear shooter - a first for a device in this class on Sprint. </p>
<p> Update: The ever-vigilant evleaks has leaked some press-quality shots of the Flash, and wow is the back of this thing ever ugly: </p>
<p> We had some internal documents regarding the upcoming Sprint Flash, a mid-range Android 4.0 handset by ZTE, leak yesterday. Today, we've got some actual pictures of the phone itself, which has a front fascia that absolutely screams "NEXUS!" </p>
<p> Does a new mid-range Android on Sprint get your juices flowing? Me neither. But we're going to tell you about it anyway. So, this is a new Sprint mid-range budget phone, and we have no idea who it's made by. Take a look at these photos, leaked courtesy of an anonymous tipster: </p>
<p> Our guess on the OEM is ZTE, but don't quote us on it. Given Sprint's relationship with the company in the past (especially on its prepaid subsidiaries), a Sprint-branded ZTE handset would make the most sense. </p>

<p> zte grand memo </p>
<p> Late yesterday, we headed over to the ZTE booth to check out the company's latest smartphone - the Grand Memo. The selling point? It's big and powerful - sporting a 5.7" display with a Snapdragon 800 600 processor of some kind. </p>
<p> Of course, that big display is only 720p. And that processor is paired with only 1GB of RAM. And it's using ZTE's Android acid trip of a UI overlay. </p>
<p> Say hello to the newest entrant into the bigger-than-a-phone-but-not-quite-a-tablet arena: ZTE's Grand Memo. It's a massive 5.7" device with a resolution of 1280x720, Qualcomm's quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB built-in storage, and a 13MP camera, running Android 4.1. While a 1080p display would've been a nice addition, there's no denying that the Grand Memo is quite a powerful device. </p>

<p> ZTE Quartz </p>
<p> ZTE announced its 'Quartz' smartwatch back in April, and it was the company's first Android Wear watch. It had 3G and was priced pretty competitively, but was exclusive to T-Mobile. That exclusivity hasn't changed, but the price has - it's now half off. </p>
<p> It's getting increasingly hard to justify a smartwatch purchase when so many of them are launching with such high price tags. Paying $400 or $500 for a watch that works the same as one that costs half as much is a tough sell, not that a cheaper watch is an easy sell either. That's what makes the ZTE Quartz intriguing. This is an Android Wear device that costs less than $200 and has a dedicated cellular connection on T-Mobile. </p>
<p> The Quartz is a bit large and clunky, and it's missing some of the features you get with more expensive watches. However, the design is solid considering the price, and it runs Android Wear just as well as more expensive watches. </p>
<p> ZTE's first Android Wear watch has been in the rumor mill for a couple of months. We first heard about its existence in February then showed you exclusive photos and details in March. Now the Quartz is official and everything we said was right on the money. </p>
<p> This will be an Android Wear 2.0 watch with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 2100 processor, 768MB of RAM and 4GB of storage, cellular connectivity (3G, no LTE here), a speaker and a microphone, IP67 water and dust resistance, and a 1.4" AMOLED display with a 400x400 resolution and Gorilla Glass 3 on top. The nice surprises are the existence of a GPS chip, which should be exciting for those who want to use it for navigation or while exercising outdoors, the relatively beefy 500 mAh battery, and the interchangeable 22mm bands.

<p> zte sanctions </p>
<p> ZTE was recently banned from acquiring components from US-based companies for seven years after the telecommunications firm violated the terms of a sanctions case. In a surprise move, President Trump announced his support for ZTE last week, tweeting that the sanctions resulted in "(t)oo many jobs in China lost." Despite this, a House committee has voted unanimously to reinforce those sanctions. </p>
<p> After cutting nearly 3,000 jobs in January, ZTE hasn't had much in the way of good news to share lately. Today, it appears the Chinese smartphone maker avoided a potentially fatal blow to its smartphone business, but did so at great cost - around a billion dollars, in fact. ZTE was accused last year of violating US sanctions against doing business with Iran (I know, ZTE is a Chinese company - this has to do with US technology), and as a result the US Department of Commerce threatened to cut off ZTE from all its US-based supply chain partners. </p>

<p> zte spro 2 </p>
<p> The ZTE Spro 2 was initially announced two years ago, and later available for sale through AT&T for $500 without a contract ($400 with an agreement). It's definitely an odd device - it's running Android with access to the Google Play Store, so you can project your favorite media apps without a connected device. Now you can get it for $399, $100 off the starting price. </p>
<p> Huh, exclusive? It's been nearly three months. That's long enough. We have a larger network than AT&T. We cover more of the country, which means there's a better chance we'll connect with someone who actually knows what a smart projector is and wants one. How many have you guys sold with AT&T anyway? </p>
<p> There has to be someone out there looking to sign a contract on a lightweight projector that's capable of running Android apps. </p>
<p> Wait, you don't even know what a smart projector is? Right... that might be a problem. Okay, I'm going to talk to my fellow AT&T execs and—you know what, screw it, we're going to sell this anyway. Someone out there is going to love it. I mean, what better way is there to impress your business clients than to whip out some cool, forward-looking piece of tech that no one else has even seen? </p>

<p> Lenovo has a lot of things going on these days as it continues to make its Lenovo-branded devices while simultaneously digesting the corpse of Motorola. It also has other sub-brands like Zuk. The latest device in that family was just announced in China, and it definitely looks good on paper with flagship specs and a reasonable price. </p>
<p> Lenovo's ZUK smartphone brand got off to a great start in China when the recently announced Z1 managed over 2 million pre-orders in a week, but surprisingly, they aren't stopping in China. An international version of the Z1 is planned, and it's going to run Cyanogen OS (lens flair optional). </p>
<p> Lenovo already has cell phone legend Motorola under its umbrella, but the company has also started a new Chinese brand called ZUK. This firm is intended to compete with the budget offerings of Xiaomi, Huawei, and others. Its first phone looks like a good start too. The Z1 has a massive battery and a USB 3.0 Type-C port. </p>

<p> Since our last LineageOS post, the project has continued to add new features and support new devices. In addition to new Quick Settings tiles and changes to included apps, the ROM now supports 16 additional devices. </p>
<p> I'm not going to tell you why you may want to install a custom recovery. You already know you need one to replace your default ROM or make carbon copies of your device's current state. And you know that the Team Win Recovery Project's custom recovery is at the top of your list of options. </p>
<p> Now TWRP has arrived for quite a few devices, including a buttload of Xiaomi phones. We're talking about the Mi 2 and Mi 4, along with their various versions. There's the Redmi 3, Redmi Note 2, and even the Mi Pad. These make the list not long after the Redmi Note 3 did the same. </p>
<p> The CyanogenMod team continues to expand its selection of builds for its aftermarket ROM, and today no less than four new devices are being added. Those would be HTC's 2015 flagship One M9, Lenovo's budget-oriented ZUK Z1, NVIDIA's SHIELD Portable (the original one with the attached controller), and the SHIELD Tablet. </p>
<p> As usual, CyanogenMod arranges builds by codename: the M9 is "himaul," the Z1 is "ham," the SHIELD Portable is "roth," and the SHIELD Tablet is... "shieldtablet." Huh. All four devices are currently on nightly builds of CyanogenMod 12.1 (Android 5.1), and may or may not be added to the more stable releases as they come. </p>

<p> The nation's big four carriers felt free to broker their customers' cellphone location data to third parties for years in order to make an easy secondhand buck off of the people who already pay them to deliver expensive wireless internet to their expensive devices. Turns out that the FCC isn't happy with their behavior and, according to Reuters's sources, may be prepared to levy an eight-digit fine against the networks. </p>
<p> Last year, a large number of U.S. carriers were under fire for selling live location data to third-party companies, including LocationSmart and Securus. These companies then sold that data to other companies, and so on and so forth. As you might expect, the bad publicity hasn't stopped carriers from working with those companies, as evidenced by a recent article from Motherboard. </p>

<p> Doomdark's Revenge is filled with large-scale, fantasy-based warfare, but don't expect much in the way of spectacle here. This is the sequel to The Lords of Midnight, a game originally released for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPC (kudos if you can recall more than one of these products) in 1984. No, fans haven't had to wait thirty years for a sequel. Doomdark's Revenge first confronted players in 1985, but here it is again, updated for a new generation of mobile gamers. </p>
<p> Breathing new energy into Mike Singleton's 1984 classic the Lords of Midnight, Chris Wild has brought the game to Android. The game, for those unaware, is an epic adventure game – first enjoyed on the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 – that takes players (along with three other characters) on an adventure to destroy the Ice Crown and defeat Doomdark, with the option to recruit lords and troops to defeat Doomdark's minions. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/03/05 7:41am PSTon Mar 5, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/23 7:11am PDTon Sep 23, 2020. </p>
<p> Zynga has officially announced that it's working on a Harry Potter match-3 game for mobile. This game is called Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells, and of course, Zynga has yet to share a single screenshot or video of the title. Paradoxically Zynga has noted that the game is already available as a soft-launch release in the Philippines, which means the studio is already publicly testing the title, which begs the question as to why there are zero screenshots or videos shared with today's announcement. Could it be that Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells is such a shallow cash grab that it's in the developer's best interest to hide what the game looks like before an official worldwide release? </p>
<p> CSR Racing 2 originally released on Android back in June of 2016. It's now over two years later, and the game is still running strong. But in order to keep fans happy over the years, new features have to roll out, and so Zynga has just announced a significant update to the game that adds sixteen new cars that span from the '60s to today. So if you have a hankering for collecting iconic vehicles, make sure to check out the new Legends update. </p>
<p> Words With Friends 2 - Word Game was recently launched on the Play Store as the follow-up sequel to Zynga's popular Scrabble clone Words With Friends. It is something of an odd release as it is more an expansion of the original gameplay than a true sequel. This luckily means that you can carry over your account and any game you are currently playing in the original to this new release without a hitch. It also means you can expect all of the same gameplay, but with a few new modes and words to play around with. </p>
<p> People Magazine and Zynga have teamed up to create the next "with friends" game. It is titled Crosswords With Friends and it is clearly a crossword game that focuses on People Magazine's bread and butter of entertainment, celebrity, and sports news. Each day a different puzzle with a new theme will be pushed to the app. That means you will receive 365 crossword puzzles a year. A lofty challenge indeed! </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a new JRPG from Kemco, a historically accurate turn-based strategy game, a new Zynga title that isn't terrible, a pixelated falling game, and a free take on Worms. Without further ado: </p>
<p> RPG Tears Revolude </p>
<p> Kemco is a prolific publisher of Japanese-style RPGs, and a big help for fans of the genre who are tired of paying Square $15 a pop for 20-year-old games. </p>
<p> The original CSR Racing racked up over 130 million downloads, becoming one of the top free-to-play games on mobile devices. It's no surprise that Zynga snapped up the developer, NaturalMotion last year for half a billion dollars. Now, the sequel has just been announced, and it's predictably titled CSR2. </p>
<p> Like its predecessor, this game will focus exclusively on the drag racing aspect with a ton of officially licensed cars from Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, and others. It's very, very pretty, but the gameplay is also quite simple. That's the formula that made the first one so popular, I suppose. </p>
<p> CSR2 will be soft launching in some regions over the next few weeks, probably on iOS first. </p>
<p> Zynga acquired NaturalMotionGames about a year ago for over half a billion dollars, and now the maker of titles like CSR Racing and Backbreaker Football has released the trailer for its first post-Zynga project. The game is called Dawn of Titans, and it's a big departure from the games NaturalMotion has been making thus far. In Dawn of Titans you control armies led by giant warriors as they do battle with other players. The developer promises fluid performance and quick gameplay that makes sense on a mobile device. </p>
<p> Stop everything. FarmVille 2: Country Escape has exited limited beta and is now available for wide release. It's time to grab your pitchforks, because there's virtual farming that needs to be done, and neither these crops nor animals will tend to themselves. You can check out our previous reporting on the game, but here's a trailer that should get you up to speed. </p>
<p> The graphics are greatly improved over the 2D original, as the game now touts 3D visuals that almost make the game tempting to play. Unfortunately, this is still FarmVille. That means despite the new cooperative gameplay, the ability to play on a mobile device, the option to play offline, or the free-to-play price tag, you're going to have to pay to play this game. </p>
<p> Here's the arrangement, dear Jaded Android Gamer - you will pretend you have zero interest in FarmVille, and we will pretend not to judge. Instead, we're even going to provide you with this tidbit of news: FarmVille 2 is coming to Android phones and tablets soon, with an early version already available for testing in select regions. </p>
<p> Horn came out on Android back in 2012, and it was a pretty big deal at the time. Phosphor Games Studio had previously seen success with Dark Meadow, and it was clear the studio could do great things. Unlike Dark Meadow, Horn was published by Zynga instead of the developer. The title made a splash when it was released, but the 1-star reviews piled up as updates failed to materialize. Phosphor Games now has control of Horn back in Google Play, but what went wrong? </p>
