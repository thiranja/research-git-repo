<p> In recovery mode, select “install zip from sd card” > “choose zip from sd card” and then choose the Android revolution HD firmware package which you have placed in the device. Once the file is selected, it will take around 4 -5 minutes for applying the update. </p>
<p> Please note that it may take longer time than expected for booting the device up as it’s the first time the device will be booting after updating the firmware. To check the firmware version, you can check the same from the path “Settings > Firmware Version” where it will be mentioned as Android Revolution HD Jellybean 4.1.2. </p>
<p> Tip: If your HTC One refuses to boot up or say gets into the boot loop mode, then you need to re-apply the whole process from the start so as to make sure that the device is updated with this firmware </p>

<p> 4 Things Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Does That S6 Can’t </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge are most beautifully designed smartphones today, as well as they are the most powerful smartphones specs wise. Though, Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge load same specification, there are few things that S6 Edge can do and the S6 can’t do. Not that we are complaining, there are things that are worth mentioning. Here are top three things that S6 Edge can do while S6 can’t. </p>
<p> Night clock </p>
<p> Being the world first dual edge smartphone, Samsung has loaded pretty impressive features that can be applied to the edge screen. Night clock is one of them, as the name implies; night clock is just a normal casual clock that will be displayed on the edge screen at night time. The display is illuminated so that the time can be clearly visible. This little trick might come handy for the people who don’t have bedside clock. </p>
<p> Pin Five Contacts to Edge Screen </p>
<p> Users of Galaxy S6 edge can pin maximum of five contacts to edge screen, a simple tap on edge will display the contact details along with options to message, call, email directly. Once you are done choosing the five contacts, there are total eight colours out of which each contact gets a colour. In case you have missed a call from any of those five contacts, you will be able to see a notification tab in the assigned colour. Impressive feature and pretty good implementation that will be of great use. This type of feature isn’t available in Galaxy S6. </p>
<p> Information Stream </p>
<p> Information stream feature was first seen on Galaxy Note Edge smartphone. This feature allows you to choose news feed from the available list and will be displayed alongside with the edge screen, which is selected as the primary side. Information stream will work without disturbing the actual screen. News feed includes twitter tweets, Yahoo sports, weather, news and there are a variety of feeds available online via Samsung store that can be downloaded and applied. </p>
<p> Edge Lighting </p>
<p> People don’t place their smartphone upside down and that doesn’t make any sense. Samsung has included a feature that makes users do so. Edge lighting is the feature that isn’t just impressive, but also a best feature of S6 Edge. If you have placed the device upside down, the active edge screen starts glowing if someone is calling or texting you. If it’s from one of the five pinned contacts, the Edge display glows in assigned colour. This type of feature goes missing in Galaxy S6 as it doesn’t have any edge. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> 4 Steps to Fix Android Device Not Booting Error </p>
<p> Are on you on the web to find a fix for the biggest problem with your mobile i.e., your phone is not booting up properly and it has chosen to take vacation. Well the situation isn’t funny and troubleshooting with primary thing which you should do first before coming to a conclusion of handing it for repair. </p>
<p> The problem can be related to corrupt Android OS or bad hardware or by the use of errant app. Here are the basic steps you can follow if your Android phone doesn’t turn up. </p>
<p> Reinsert Battery </p>
<p> For all the devices if your phone doesn’t start, then you should remove the battery from your mobile phone and leave it out for atleast 10 seconds. Don’t try to remove battery from the phones which doesn’t provide the option to remove it. Reinstall the battery on to your phone and see if that fixes the issue or not. This step doesn’t seems to be logical but it does work for almost to 50 % of the phone battery problems. </p>
<p> Remove Hardware </p>
<p> Sometimes due to hardware you might not be able boot your PC. So if you have SD card or any other item plugged into your device then unplug the same. Check it out if that solves the problem on your phone. </p>
<p> Power Issues </p>
<p> If you find that your phone is not turning on all the time, then there might not be enough power to turn on the device as there is a minimum rating of power required to make the device turn ON. If you battery doesn’t have sufficient power then it’s clear that it will not turn ON and you should plugin the power adapter to your device to charge the battery. It’s not recommended to use the connection to a computer or any other device as its not sufficient to power the devices. Many users make use of USB port to meet their power requirement of the phone but in this case where there is very much less battery this will not work out. </p>
<p> Another issue which might come is that the battery is old now and it gone faulty. The only solution to such problem is to replace with a new battery or to test it borrow battery from a friend which uses the same device. </p>
<p> Hard Reset </p>
<p> If you have tried all the above mentioned steps here and still couldn’t find a fix then is the time you wants to reset your device which is the last resort of troubleshooting at home. But before you do the hard reset on your phone let me tell you that it will erase all the data from your phone memory. There is usually a provision provided to go with the hardware reset of your phone before the phone loads. Go through your manual for any specific instructions and get your phone into the recovery mode. For most of the phone it’s the combination of Volume up button and the power button. For Samsung phones you need to long press on the Volume up key along with holding power button you need to press the menu button too. Once you are in the recovery mode you need to click on Wipe Data/Factory Reset and Clear Cache. </p>

<p> Check the permissions required by this app and you’ll think twice about installing it. Full accounts access? For a sound generator? Not in this life. </p>
<p> Isn’t using the app on smartphone more poer consuming than one of those mosquito repellent devices. </p>
<p> Mosquito repellant is adware, no way an app like this should be 1mb over, you wonder what else is coded into it. </p>

<p> Gionee Elife S5.5 Review – The Slimmest Smart Beast – 5 Day Challenge </p>
<p> We at AdvicesMedia have come up with a new way of reviewing Smart Phones and this is in a series of videos where would be focusing on reviewing the devices differently. Unlike the traditional approach of creating Unboxing Videos and going with Benchmark Videos which actually don’t make any sense, we thought of creating a small challenge by using the products to the max in a limited amount of time. </p>
<p> Day 1 : First Impressions on the SmartPhone which in this case is the Gionee Elife S5.5 where in we are actually impressed with the device in terms of the thickness, form factor and the design. The device comes with a glass front and back along with a powerful Octa-core processor on a 5.55mm thickness body and with a full HD display at 5″. The device is clearly a flagship killer but there are certainly a few cons too which we would be only knowing once do a thorough review of the device. </p>
<p> www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR8gYl5CxMM </p>
<p> Day 2 : The S5.5 comes with top notch hardware at a budget price which leads to a amazing Performance even when you play high end games or perform multi tasking. If you are in a middle of any game and would switch to some other application the device does not get hanged and works flawlessly. We found a major flaw with the device which is with the heating of the phone, which is logically expected but not upto these levels. Watch the Video of the Day #2 to know more. </p>
<p> www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZKN77XczZk </p>
<p> Day 3 : We tested the S5.5’s Camera in detail under different lightning conditions and found that the Camera is pretty much good in artificial light but is the worst in low light mode. Watch the video below to check out the Camera Capture samples along with Video demo at 1080P resolution. </p>
<p> www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UlbMJWp954 </p>
<p> Final Verdict : In the following video we have showcased the most Important Pro’s and Con’s of the Gionee Elife S5.5 Smart Phone and why you should be buying it. We have also discussed on why you should also give a check on the Moto X and ignore the other plastic smart phones like the Galaxy Grand series which also comes in the same price point. </p>

<p> 5 Reasons Why You Should Buy the Samsung Galaxy S6 </p>
<p> While it’s not the newest phone on the block, the Samsung Galaxy S6 is still probably your best bet when it comes to buying a smart device. This is especially true if you are a dedicated Android user. But why is the Samsung Galaxy S6 the best option? Glad you asked. Here is a list of some of the greatest features of the Samsung Galaxy S6, available now at iiNet. </p>
<p> 1. It still looks amazing Samsung certainly made a good first impression with the Galaxy S6, as critics from sites and publications large and small marveled at its aesthetics. Samsung ditched the chunky plastic body of previous versions and instead opted for a sleek, stylish, attractive metal and glass build that is visually stunning. They also bucked the trend of companies following the theory that bigger is always better by keeping the screen size at 5.1 inches, which still dwarfs some competitors. Great to look at and easy to use – what more do you need? </p>
<p> 2. The camera is killer Samsung made a concerted effort to improve its camera to stand against iPhone 6, and it shows. The Galaxy S6’s photo snapping abilities are incredible, and the feature is easy to use. A quick double-tap of the home button pulls up the camera interface. The camera itself is 16 megapixels and has an improved lens from the former Galaxy S5. Users that often find themselves left with blurry shots will appreciate the optical image stabilization and automatic high dynamic range (HDR) capabilities. </p>
<p> 3. Have it your way This is more of a tick in the win column for Android, as the operating system provides loads of options for customization. Digging deeper into the Samsung Galaxy S6 sees a simpler user interface that will help you get the most out of Android 5.0 Lollipop. Addressing complaints from previous editions, Samsung has made it much easier to set up the phone according to your specific needs and desires. </p>
<p> 4. Samsung Pay could be here to stay Mobile wallet technology has been a recent bone of contention for tech heads. Some think it is the wave of the future, while others are convinced it will never be accepted widely enough to be a convenient alternative to standard physical wallets. If you’re interested in checking out the possibilities of a mobile wallet, the Samsung Galaxy S6’s Samsung Pay system is what you’re after. The system’s magnetic secure transmission method of transmitting data is already accepted at many outlets, meaning you don’t have to wait for your favorite stores to get up to speed with special readers. </p>
<p> 5. Leave your cords at home Much like the aforementioned mobile payment technology, wireless charging is another relatively new technology that users are excited to try out. While some phones require the purchase of extra gear in order to utilise the feature, the Samsung Galaxy S6 isn’t one of them. The phone comes prepared to handle wireless charging, giving you more freedom when it comes to juicing up your battery. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> 5 Things Every Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge owners should Do </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, the world’s most beautifully designed Android smartphone, the device comes with a dual edge screen that is a delight to look at. Samsung has done the pretty good job with S6 Edge, be it the display, the processor, and camera, everything looks so great on paper and in reality. If you are an S6 Edge user, here are some of the things you need to do before you proceed using the S6 Edge. </p>
<p> Edge Screen Setup </p>
<p> Edge screen is not just for the show; it illuminates a certain colour on the edge of screen based on who’s calling or texting you. This is one such feature that makes the S6 Edge experience amazing. To setup this functionality; head to system settings and select edge screen and turn on the edge screen lighting option. But there’s a catch, you can just set a maximum of five contacts to edge screen. Which device lets you choose and assign a colour to each contact and the same will be displayed on the edge screen. Once you’ve done the required settings, the edge display starts to glow whenever you receive any notification. All these settings will be available under edge screen menu in system settings. </p>
<p> Quick Replies </p>
<p> Samsung’s heart rate sensor was just an app that used to measure your pulse and heart rate. Well, this time Samsung has intended to add some extra functionality to it. The heart rate sensor will now send quick replies when you get a call from the five contacts pinned to edge screen, and you don’t want to take the call. Then, just touch the heart rate sensor for two seconds, the call gets rejected automatically and sends a customized message (that has to be set by you). Let the caller know that you are not able to answer. To setup this, go to system settings then to edge settings and turn on the Quick Reply option. Samsung has made good use of the heart rate sensor. </p>
<p> Information Stream </p>
<p> The edge screen can also be used to display news feed, Twitter updates, weather, news, etc., which we have seen on Galaxy Note Edge smartphone. The setup of the news feed is simple, open edge settings from system default settings menu and tap the “Information stream” option to display the news feed. You can use “manage feed” setting to get more feeds from online, which will be displayed in the list automatically once downloaded. Unfortunately, Facebook feeds aren’t available, and you are left with Twitter trends, yahoo news, sports, weather, etc. But still a better way to utilise the edge screen functionality. </p>
<p> Select A Default Primary Side </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge is world’s first dual edge screen smartphone. Having said that, only one side of the edge screen can be used as primary side. Every person taste and comfort zone differ, if you don’t like the edge display on your left side you can always shift it to the right. Head to system settings and choose edge screen option from there select edge screen position and set it according to your liking. Though, it is sad that we can’t use both the edge screens at a same time, but that’s how it works on S6 Edge. </p>
<p> Night clock on Edge Screen </p>
<p> Night clock on edge screen is a good point; you don’t need to turn ON display to know the exact time. Thanks to Super AMOLED display, the clock is illuminated at night and doesn’t eat up the battery. To enable the night clock, open system settings, and then, edge screen settings, now tap on the night clock and choose desired design and style to display a clock. </p>

Briefing pane widget is one among them, which updates the user with latest news and features, but at the same time it drains the battery faster. So, uninstall those apps and widgets which are draining the battery. </p>
<p> 6. Turn OFF the device when not in use – </p>

<p> People, stop being such idiots. The point of this article is ONLY to allow you to download the Free App of the Day for free. NOT to be able to purchase any random app that you choose and not have to pay for it! The dummy credit card details are never touched, unless you try to actually purchase an app–which will fail of course, and probably flag your account to Amazon staff. The only fraud about this is that you are violating the Amazon App Store user agreement which states that it is only valid within the U.S. That’s one bit of fraud I am perfectly happy to live with, as the restriction is absolutely 100% wrong and inappropriate. </p>
<p> Incredible, it work!, i have a kindle fire but i have not a eeuu credit card, now i can download the free apps from amazon app store, ty ty a lot 😀 </p>
<p> After few tries, all revert back to normal. Means, it detected me from outside us and cant proceed to download the apps </p>

<p> Amazing – worked first time…and if you want paid apps just order it, wait for the e-mail saying it won’t process and then enter your own card details and it works perfectly! One very happy son! Thank you. </p>
<p> I’m having problems with the credit card part. Do I just input in a random expiration date and card holder name? cause you didn’t specify it above. </p>
<p> Even if i do that when i click to ‘buy app’ it goes “There was an error purchasing (whatever app). Please click here to verify your payment method and try again”. </p>
<p> I tried using different credit cards given above using a US residential address but it still does not work, what could be the problem here? I assume its just the fake credit card expiry date and card holder name which wasnt mentioned might be the cause. </p>
<p> you will have to generate using the above procedure or you can make use of fakenamegenerator for the same! </p>
<p> But now it goes it is not available to my region yet (I live in Australia), even though the address is in the US and plus i was still able to download the free apps just not the paid, im confused. </p>
<p> Ofcourse the paid apps won’t work! This is just to allow you access to the free apps. Those aren’t real credit card numbers. I can’t believe you would even try that. </p>
<p> hey please tell a fake address i tried several addresses of US but amazon says “The street name or number appears to be invalid.” </p>
<p> Should I use my real name,e-mail ID and mobile phone number or use dummy ones from the name generator?My real e-mail and mobile number is a clear indication that I’m from Turkey.Please clarify. </p>
<p> i’m stuck at “We could not process your order because of geographical restrictions on the product which you were attempting to purchase. Please refer to the terms of use for this product to determine the geographical restrictions. </p>
<p> We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.” when i press the get app button….. </p>
<p> i done all and now on my mobile i have amazon appstore application but when ever i download any application its ask me to add payment method and i dont have any cardit card? help??? </p>
<p> hey tanveer you can refer the above procedure wherein dummy credit card numbers are mentioned! </p>
<p> I dont understand how Amazon can approve them if they are as you say “dummy” ? And since you mention expirydate/valid date in the same context it makes me think these are actually real number. Although i’m a bit sceptic if that is the case with Visa number such as 4111111111111111 so i cant decide which way it is to be honest. </p>
<p> If these numbers are indeed real card numbers then yes this is a fraud and people should not use them! On the other hand if these are just dummy card numbers without a real owner i see this as a smart hack which is pretty harmless. Please clarify which is it? i really dont want to mess with it if someone owns these numbers myself. </p>
<p> no it will not work! you need to enter the numbers which ar ementione dabove as these are dummy numbers! </p>
<p> are you fucking insane? are you publicly asking people to commit fraud??? irrespective of whether these credit card numbers are fake or not, using fake credit card numbers to cheat and get something for free is FRAUD. correct me if i am wrong. till then, mr. neal pradeep, you have lost all respect from me. </p>
<p> hi rajat we can understand your feelings but all the above credit cards are dummy ones and can only be used on AMAZON APP STORE.and we havent shared any other details like expiry / valid from date. i hope now i can restore the trust which was lost in your way!! 🙂 </p>
<p> I was glad to hear from your website that the Amazon App Store is available outside America and I was disappointed that it wasn’t after registering with them. I am from Malaysia. </p>

<p> Access Amazon AppStore outside US & Get Free Apps Daily </p>
<p> By the time you would be aware of what buzz Amazon AppStore has created. Many users were eagerly waiting for it and Android users from United States were first to taste it. For your information, Amazon AppStore is the competitor of Android Market and provides a free app giveaway daily. </p>
<p> With the news that Amazon AppStore first spotted in US where it was offering one paid app for free download, everyone was overjoyed and users looked to sign up with Amazon AppStore using US address. For United States users there is no hitch on using the Amazon AppStore, it works perfectly fine and they are enjoying one free paid app daily. Now users around the world shouldn’t be panic and look for alternatives of cracking Amazon AppStore who likes outside United States. </p>
<p> Here we have the news that Amazon AppStore has launched outside United States although the penetration of this news is not so quick but they have made it available. We have come across few reports from many sources from places such as United Kingdom and Netherlands. Also users from India were lucky to get this Amazon AppStore. For many users its live and working on their mobile phone. </p>
<p> For users who live in Canada can also try out using Amazon AppStore on their mobile phone and good thing is that it can be installed on any phone running on Google powered Android operating system. This seems to be a very good news for the Android users and interesting the news that one paid app for free officially from Amazon makes it a killer news. </p>
<p> To download this app you need to visit this link – amazon.com/appstorelanding from your mobile’s browser which will directly start downloading the application’s apk file onto your phone. Next the application would be installed onto your phone. </p>
<p> Next you will have to signin to your Amazon account if you already have. If you don’t have any, you need to ensure that you have your Credit Card ready because that’s required to be entered when signing up for a new Amazon Account. Following this once you have logged into your account you can find all the apps listed in a very good interface. </p>
<p> You can click on the ‘Paid app a day’ free option and then download / install the listed application for free of cost. You need to tap on the ‘FREE’ button for this and following this it would be purchased / verified and downloaded to your device for free. </p>
<p> Update : This app is not yet available in a few countries like India, but it was available randomly for a day and amazon pulled it off without giving any reasons for the same. You can try it out regularly and see if you are able to download these paid apps for free on your mobile and let us know about the same too. </p>

You only need find and configure a free USA proxy server on the app. Then all traffic to Amazon will route the USA server, makes it looks like you’re real us user. </p>
<p> Remember you need register Amazon with US credit card and billing adress as well. </p>

<p> You need to Add Debit / Credit Card for accessing the amazon app store. Though no money will be deducted, the debit / credit card needs to be added without that you can’t download. </p>
<p> Nice article but when i try to download it on android device it ask me to complete the payment option and i don’t have any type of card with me. </p>
<p> Atleast a credit card or debit card is required, there are no charges but you need to add a card. </p>
<p> This is NOT CORRECT in the UK still get not yet available in your area. So why report it if its not available in UK or Taiwan etc?? I also notice there are no actual reports just the usual I heard……etc </p>
<p> That’s why I say few reports the availability of Amazon AppStore, maybe its not working on your phone or carrier. </p>
<p> Its not available worldwide officially but you can still give a try and check if its available for you. Soon it will be available for everyone. </p>
<p> But when i try to download that daily free app it gives a message to set payment settings in my account.. </p>

<p> Well, if you are thinking that it will not be secured solution then you are wrong. You can setup password access of your phone on Browsix in your phone through the Settings tap on your phone. </p>
<p> So did you find the app worthy enough? Something interesting? Do let us know your view about it through comments. </p>
<p> I’ve a Symbian^3 phone which has the app Joikuspot using which I can create a WiFi Hotspot. The next thing I did is connected my Android phone to this WiFi Hotspot and followed all the Browix steps given above, but it didn’t work. Can you please help me with this matter? </p>
<p> A password yes. But what will the Browsix guys do with my data? They can easily copy it and use and abuse it as they want. </p>
<p> I have No idea on what access to personal security they have with each users, its out of my scope & study. </p>
<p> I was worried about the security. But you answered in last para of your post as password can be set up through “Settings” </p>
<p> No that is not possible but the content on your phone can viewed on your PC. Not sure of tablet whether it works or not! I guess it should work because what it needs is just the Android app to be compatible. </p>

<p> How to Access Google Nexus Files on a Apple Mac </p>
<p> If you’re an Apple’s Mac OS user and also have a Google Nexus 7 device, getting to access the files in your Nexus device might be tougher than how an external storage generally is. You might have experienced that it doesn’t show up as a normal storage device in the Finder application. This is because the Nexus 7 uses MTP protocol and OS X does not support the Media Transfer Protocol out of the box. </p>
<p> However, there’s a small application that can be used for this which can be implemented to ensure that file transfers through the Nexus 7 work normally as they’re supposed to. </p>
<p> Here are the steps to do them: </p>
<p> You need to head to http://www.android.com/filetransfer/ and download the File Transfer application and have it installed on the Mac. </p>
<p> Now, install the DMG that has been downloaded. </p>
<p> That’s with the setting up of the Android File Transfer Application. Go ahead and connect your Nexus device now and you can see it appear on your desktop screen of your OS X operating system. </p>
<p> If at all the device’s files aren’t seen, go to settings on your Nexus device, USB Settings and make sure USB MTP is enabled. </p>
<p> That’s all is needed to get the Nexus device’s files accessible on your Mac. Pretty simple, isn’t it? Do let us know if you have any queries in the comments section. </p>

<p> How to Access Offline Android Maps with Pre-Cache Labs Feature </p>
<p> The Google Maps is the best mapping service provided by Google for free for non-commercial use. The Google Maps services is available on the smartphones to provide point to point navigation. Here in this article we will go on how to access offline Android Maps parts with Pre-Cache Labs features. </p>
<p> Access Offline Android Maps with Pre-Cache Labs Feature </p>
<p> This is how you can enable Offline Maps access on Pre-Cache Labs – </p>
<p> Open Maps in your Android mobile phone. </p>
<p> Wait until the maps loads fully and then press the Menu button. Further choose More options > Labs. </p>
<p> Google keeps experimenting on the on the various features and takes inputs from the users to improve their services to provide new improvements. All the experimental features are present in Labs section of the Maps and users who wish to try out this feature can enable them. </p>
<p> In the Labs section you will find the a feature called “Pre-Cache Map Area“. This options once enabled will be able to load your Google Maps in the places where you don’t have internet connection. </p>
<p> Something like if you are going on a trip for a place where there is no data coverage, the ‘Precache map area‘ option on the Place Pages will load up the map area before you go. The users one time have to load that place on their phone to catch the cache map area. Once you do that it will take certain time to Precache map area within the 10 meters of area that you have selected. </p>

<p> It’s nice to be able to pre-cache maps. Indeed when I am within the pre-cached map area (and with 3G/4G signal deliberately turned off) the GPS automatically calls up the map and displays my position on the road. </p>
<p> However if I enter a location within the map that I want to actively navigate to, the system simply tells me that there is no cell tower signal and keeps trying to get a signal. I thought that once the map is in memory the full navigation system would totally work including voice directions and rerouting information. </p>
<p> Am I doing something wrong or is it simply that no active navigation is possible unless there is also a cell tower signal? </p>
<p> Its a good feature but you can only download max of 10 pre cache maps not more then that. If you wish to download an entire country or a very large area you cant do that. </p>
<p> Yes its good feature but it does not allow to store full detalis.I mean it only stores roads but does not stores all the deatils about all places . </p>
<p> Dear Yogesh, Thanks a lot for your write up. I will be going to North East in a weeks time. There are no signals in many places. So this will be very much useful to me. But I di’nt understand this feature completely. </p>
<p> I followed your instructions. And I pressed my finger at Guwahati and clicked on \precache map area\. It followed the steps as told by you and said \The out lined area of the map has been pre cached\, by showing a square. </p>
<p> Now can you tell me how I can see this map in a place where there is no signal (say I want to check this by making \Flight mode ON\) </p>
<p> And how I can see the entire state of Assam with this feature? </p>
<p> You don’t need to do anything. When you are in Assam or the place for which you have set precache map area, it will be automatically shown on your phone when you are at that place. I hope its clear now. In turn what we are doing is storing (downloading on to phone) a place map location area and when you have no signal on your phone, the precache is accessed. </p>
<p> In the last paragraph, don’t you mean 10 miles instead of meters? </p>
<p> Great idea though I and for one am looking forward to it working in my apps which depend on this. </p>
<p> Thanks. I dint knew about this option on Google Maps app, the precache map feature is so helpful, i face a lot of problem in loading the map where there is no 3G connectivity, gprs takes too much time. </p>
<p> No probleme yogesh and neal brothers i am 24/15hours on androiadvices.com because i love this webdite i was eating when this tips appeared i was late but good tips i am 15 hours on androidadvvices.com just for an new bther rom for samsung galaxy s gt-i9000 i am waiting an decent rom than xxjvt with battery backuo and excellent improvement of wifi and with more functions </p>

<p> Acer Iconia Tab A500 Vs Motorola XOOM Tablet </p>
<p> The Motorola XOOM has been one of the most spoken about Honeycomb tablets since its launch because it was the first device to come with Android Honeycomb while the Iconia Tab from Acer has its own appeal for the sleek look and the grey bezel which is indeed attractive. Honeycomb based tablets are improving day by day, with google introducing the 3.2 Honeycomb update and more of them are to come soon. </p>
<p> We compare the Acer Iconia Tab A500 and the Motorola XOOM tablet in this post, looking at all the features and technical specifications in detail: </p>
<p> Form Factor: </p>
<p> The Iconia Tab is really thin and has dimensions of 260 x 177 x 13.3 mm while the Motorola Xoom is 241.2 x 185.7 x 8.8 mm, quite slim in our opinion and the Iconia weights 730 grams, with a similar 730 grams weight on the Xoom too. Though both devices have a 10 inch screen, do consider the extra bezel all around and dimensions before you make the pic, if you are looking for portability and the feel in your hands. </p>
<p> Display: When it comes to the display, the Acer Iconia A500 has a 10.1 inch screen, which supports upto 256K colors while the Motorola XOOM has a similar screen of 10.1 inches and supports 16M colors. The Acer Iconia has a proximity sensor and a couple of other sensors like gyroscope, but the XOOM does not have a proximity sensor on the device but it does have an accelrometer. </p>
<p> The Iconia A500 from Acer has a TFT screen has a resolution of 800 x 1280 pixels while the Mototola Xoom also has the same resolution on its screen. Also, both the tablets have a three-axis gyroscope sensor and support multi touch input on their screens. </p>
<p> Camera: </p>
<p> Both the tablets come with cameras and the Iconia from Acer has a 5 megapixel camera with a single LED flash with a resolution of 3264×2448 pixels. On the other hand, the Xoom’s camera also has the same camera unit, with a 5MP camera and a resolution of 3264×2448 pixels. There’s Geo Tagging on the Motorola XOOM, enabling you to add your position while you shoot photos. </p>
<p> The Motorola XOOM’s camera comes with , auto focus and dual-LED flash and the Iconia A500 has an LED flash and autofocus. Coming to the video recording capabilities, the both the devices record HD video at 720p at 30 frames per second. </p>
<p> Both the tablets here, the Motorola XOOM and Acer Iconia tab have a secondary front facing camera, a 2MP one and is used for video calling and by various apps on the Android platform such as Skype, Fring etc. </p>
<p> Operating System and User Interface: </p>
<p> The Acer Iconia and Motola XOOM run on Honeycomb 3.1, a newer version of Android, and Honeycomb 3.2 update is available for all the users of the Motorola Xoom now though the Iconia A500 is yet to receive it. Note that there are quite a few apps only on the HoneyComb platform, unlike the Android Market on smartphones. All apps which run on your Android smartphone will run on the tablet too, however, they will be of a smaller resolution and will appear stretched and pixelated on this huge screen. Tablet specific apps are only about 200 in the Android Market and you can check out the Best Apps for Honeycomb Tablets and Best Games for HoneyComb Tablets also. </p>
<p> Though they run on the same operating system, there is a slight change in the User Interface. Acer Iconia runs Acer’s UI on top of Honeycomb, which adds its own small tweaks and gesture improvements throughout the software while Motorola XOOM has the Motorola UI on top of Honeycomb, which looks more attractive and is more intuitive to use than the Acer UI. </p>
<p> Connectivity: </p>
<p> The XOOM supports GSM bands on 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 and both support HSDPA on 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100 on 3G and comes with a standard SIM Card slot, if you are going for the 3G Model. The A500 Iconia also has similar specifications on 3G, but very few regions have the 3G version of the tablet and the WiFi only version is only widely available. So do check out before buying. </p>
<p> The XOOM has dual-band similar Wi-FI support, with Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n while the A500 Iconia has only single band Wifi 802.11 a/b/g/n and both of them have WiFi Hotspot capabalities. </p>
<p> A-GPS support for locaion and navigation are also present and both devices have Bluetooth 2.1 and USB 2.0 connectivity, along with a HDMI port on the Xoom and Iconia making it a true entertainer on the move. With the cable given, you can connect it to any largescreen display and enjoy your HD videos or movies which are stored on your tablet. </p>
<p> Memory: </p>
<p> The Acer Iconia A500 comes with either 16/32 GB of internal storage, and has a microSD. But, the Xoom has more options, it comes with 16, 32 and 64GB Versions and also has a microSD slot which supports upto 32GB. </p>
<p> Processor and Battery: </p>
<p> The Acer Iconia A500 has a Dual-core 1GHz ARM Cortex-A9 processor with 1 GB RAM while the XOOM has a similar 1 GHz Dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor with 1GB of DDR2 RAM. </p>
<p> Though both the processors might look similar on the technical side, the A500 has a Tegra 2 T20 chipset with ULP GeForce™ GPU for quick Web browsing and HD Gaming. The Moto XOOM also has the same GPU based on GeForce. </p>
<p> Iconia has a comes with 2 3260 mAh battery in series while the Motorola XOOM also has the same setup, with two of 3250mAh batteries and both of them can stand continuous browsing and media usage and last for over 10 hours very easily. </p>
<p> Conclusion: </p>
<p> Both the tablets have almost the same specifications, but the Motorola XOOM has an edge over the Iconia Tab from Acer, thanks to better build quality from Motorola’s engineers and the 3.2 HoneyComb update as well. The Iconia Tab, though lacks on build quality, is an amazing value for money device and is the best if you have a very tight budget. However, it would be better to spend some more money, and buy the Xoom for a couple of more features it offers and much better overall build quality. </p>

<p> Acer Iconia Tab A700 Quad-Core Android Tablet – Specs & Photos </p>
<p> On-going CES 2012, the world’s largest consumer electronics trade show held at Las Vegas as expect is coming out with announcements of many Android tablets. Apart from Acer Iconia 200 tablet we expected that Iconia A700 will also come up and whole the buzz around Acer Iconia Tab 700 is that it will be those early tablets in Android category which will get the quad core processor. If it happens to be with quad core, this would be the first Android device as no phone has come with quad core processor. </p>
<p> Among the other specifications of this tablet known are the 10 inches display screen with native full HD 1080p HD display. Also it’s known to contain 1920 x 1200 pixels resolution display screen and will be with Tegra 3 processor along with 5 mega pixel camera with flash support and Dolby Digital audio. It will contain the micro HDMI port and microSD card slot and a dedicated rotation lock switch. It will be powered with 9800 mAh battery which will last for even longer power supply to the tablet. Needless to say that with such a powerful specifications, the Android 4.0 the latest update to Google’s mobile software is must. There is much hype about the Ice Cream Sandwich Android update which brings a complete makeover to the Android operating system as introduced by Google. </p>
<p> Unlike other tablets manufacturer who come up with their own line of Android OS customization like Samsung with TouchWiz, the Acer are happy to provide the stock Android user interface as it is and instead it will focus on many other value added services like AcerCloud. Other services are in pipeline and will let you know once the specifications are out with full details. </p>
<p> We also have got the pricing information available for this tablet. This tablet will be available for €549 i.e., $ 719 for the entry level 16 GB version and the 64 GB variant of this will be priced at €749 or $ 981 in Americal currency. Looks like a bit costly but the power packed specifications makes this device worth of the price which you pay. Acer is still to confirm the prices of this tablet officially. </p>

With vastly improved animation in the app drawer, it allows configuration of the number of rows and columns on a home screen page and also with this you can configure a number of columns in the dock.

<p> How to Activate Flashlight / Torch on Samsung Galaxy S4 & Note 3 without App </p>
<p> Why to use an external app when your smartphone offers that features without a problem? that’s what is seen in the flagship devices from most of the brands, and we are talking of a feature that is available as a widget in the Samsung’s flagship devices – flashlight. There is a feature in the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and the Galaxy S4 devices called the Assistive Light which is present as a widget in the smartphone. </p>
<p> This would come handy especially when you wanted to use the flash in the device as a flashlight / torch and would just open the Play Store to search for an app that would do it. But, is there a need? especially when there is a simple utility that would do the function easily, and avoid the load on the device with that external app installed. </p>
<p> You of course won’t be able to find an app or shortcut for this, and should have to go to the App drawer and then tap the “Widgets” tab on the top, to open all the available widgets. You will see a 1×1 widget named “Assistive light” which is the one you need to hold and place it as a widget somewhere on one of the home screens. </p>
<p> Once placed, you will just need to tap on the widget and it would activate the flash. With this, you won’t be able to play around and make it work like an intermittent flashing light or the disco light, but will be able to just use it as a normal flashlight whenever needed. </p>
<p> This would come quite handy when you really were in a need of the flashlight and at that certain point, there wasn’t an internet connection available. This would be lot better than turning the video recording on with the flash activated (yeah, many used to do that and habits don’t go away easily). We had earlier shared quite a few tips, such as capturing screenshots on Galaxy Note 3 and others, which you can check out in the Note 3 archive. The trick given above works with both, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and also the Galaxy S4, and it’s exactly the same in both the devices. </p>

<p> Rotate: </p>
<p> Many times it happens that Maps shows the opposite direction or the inverted direction and this is very painful when we are at any new place, so with rotate option, you can rotate the Map view in the direction you want it so that you can match the road on your direction. </p>
<p> Compass Mode: </p>
<p> With an on screen Live small compass symbol right on the Left hand side corner of the map screen you will always get an idea on which direction you are going in and also you can orient the map in your direction as the Map flips out in the 3D view which automatically rotates the compass too once you rotate the maps. </p>

<p> Offline Access: </p>
<p> Whenever we go to a new place we fear of high data rates and what if you need to seriously need to search a place where you need to go, so this means that you will have to make use of Maps which will attract the data charges and also will require continuous GPRS/Internet connectivity , no more as the maps are preloaded in the background so you can see and interact with the maps easily with the map and even if you lose the connection temporarily the maps will be accurate in most of the cases. </p>

<p> Could someone, who knows English, please proof read and correct the Android Advices columns? I’m not an English major by any means, but these articles are painful to read. It looks like you write them in Chinese and translate with an alpha translator. How many people cringe while trying to understand what you are attempting to communicate to your readers? The web has matured, and there is just no reason for these poorly written, 2nd grade attempts at providing information to people that can read at a high school level. Be proud of your work. </p>
<p> In my samsung galaxy s, I can’t view the 3D maps. When I tried to down load google maps 5 from here, it says I already have that. So how to activate the 3D. </p>

<p> Activate and Use Knock Code Security Feature on LG G Pro 2 </p>
<p> Knock Code is the new feature in the LG phones, which was recently announced when the G Pro 2 was made official during the Mobile World Congress 2014 event. The Knock Code takes the security to the level ahead from what it was when Pattern and PIN unlock were the options available. Knock On was another feature in the LG phones, i.e. in high-end devices such as LG G2, where a double tap on the screen would activate the display, and then you can unlock it. But with Knock Code, it isn’t about activating the screen but also unlocking it with a security pass. </p>
<p> How to use Knock Code </p>
<p> When activated, you will see an empty space in the lock screen where you have to tap the screen in particular pattern which you set, for the G Pro 2 to recognize that and unlock the screen for you. It can be a combination from 4 to 8 continuous taps in the way you can remember always to unlock the screen. Check below for the guide explaining how you can activate this feature and set it up. </p>
<p> To set up the Knock Code feature on your LG G Pro 2, you need to go to: Settings > Display > Home & Lock > Lock Screen. In the lock screen settings, you will find the option “Select screen lock” tapping which you get the various lock screen options. Tap on Knock Code and you will be sent to the settings of Knock Code. </p>
<p> Here, you will have to use a combination of the pattern for tapping in the four blocks, and a total of 8 times, you can tap for a sequence. Once the sequence is done, you need to proceed with the same once again and then have to set a backup key so that you have an option to unlock the screen if the Knock Code is forgotten and you have no option to unlock the screen. </p>
<p> Once you set that up and lock the screen, you will notice a small blank space in the bottom half of the screen and above it, the message “Tap knock code sequence to unlock”. Tap the sequence there, assuming that the area has four sections. If at all you are not able to unlock with this, the backup pin which you set should be helpful, and it would show only when you have a few failed attempts of unlocking with the Knock Code. </p>
<p> This is one of the best locking systems, and even better than the Face Unlock which has a flaw that someone with your photo can unlock the screen but with Knock Code, you can have an 8-tap sequence and make the security even harder. </p>

<p> I installed this application and I keep it for 1 minute and AS FAST AS POSIBLE I uninstalled. I have samsung galaxy s and it almost broke my phone. 0 point application. </p>
<p> Dear Sitotio: Could you say what was the problem which almost broke your phone? Thank you. </p>
<p> After I installed Phonebook 2.0, I start synchronization with Facebook to add images and birthday. At one moment it put a blank screen and it start flashing like crazy. I can not open the phone in order to access menus or other functionality. I restarted using hard-mode (battery remove). And I uninstalled before it could make another flashing. I could look just for 1 minute to this application and i had great expectations from this but I was very disappointed. Maybe it was because I have a root phone with extra ordinary ROM 3.4 or it entered in conflict with other application from my phone (for example LOOKOUT), i do not know but it do not want application that start acting like crazy. </p>

<p> Add Direct Dials Contacts on Homescreens with Shortcuts to your Phone Contacts </p>
<p> You might have certain contacts whom you call very often. It maybe your siblings, husband or wife, colleague or business partner. Generally to call them you need to go to contacts, search for their name and tap on call. It’s a little bit time consuming process but you can save the time by settings the often called contacts as ‘Favorites’ in contacts menu. We have gone through a procedure on how you can set contacts as your favorites. But over the time as Android has been evolved from Android 2.3 Gingerbread to the big update of Ice Cream Sandwich has released, it brings a host of functions and features added to your phone. There is much demand for the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating system. Android ICS is not just about the Face Unlock or Data Usage or Android beam feature its more than that. The features added provides much improvements and enhancements from the previous version of Android and it has put itself in a strong fight with iOS 5 vs Windows 8 phone OS head to head this year. </p>
<p> Going through the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich on Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone update which was received a few weeks back, I have spotted many new features. Since I have on the Indian version, I can spot so many new features added in the shortcuts menu. This includes Applications, Bookmark, Contact, Direct Dial, Direct Message, Directions and Navigation, Dropbox Folder, Kies via Air, Settings Shortcut and GMail label. Here in this article we will go through on how to add Direct dial contact and its purpose. </p>
<p> The ‘Direct dial’ option located under Shortcuts, is meant for the users who want to quickly add single touch call functionality to their smartphone. This option is spotted on the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating system and I can spot this on my Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. I really love this and with it I can now add contacts whom I call very often to my home screen and enable single touch call feature. This in turn saves my time of going through contacts, scrolling for the name and making a call. With this option I will be adding those contacts whom I call very often and this includes my family members, my friends and colleagues at my office. </p>
<p> To do this, follow the steps here – </p>
<p> Long press on any of the home screen and you will see the following ‘Add to Home’ list. </p>
<p> Among the various options you need to select the ‘Shortcuts’. </p>
<p> In the shortcuts menu, there have been serious improvements from the earlier version of Android like Gingerbread, Froyo. Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich adds option to ‘Direct dial’ by which users can directly make a voice call with a single tap. Tap on the option of direct dial. </p>
<p> Once you do that you will be spotted with the contacts menu. </p>
<p> With the contacts menu, you need to select the contact to whom you call regularly. </p>
<p> Once the contact selection is done, his name with the speed dial logo would be saved just like this </p>
<p> Now when you want to call them, just tap on that icon and you are connected. </p>
<p> In the similar manner you can add as many contacts as you want and this tutorial was of adding a single contact. Isn’t this lovely? </p>

<p> you can extract the same from the Sim card. Go to Contacts, press the Menu button to copy the same to the device memory </p>
<p> You may also check this video on Direct Inward Diaing (DID) is. It is based on Ozeki Phone System XE and it fairly explains DID and VoIP: ozekiphone.com/home-316.html </p>
<p> Is there a way to remove the big M or H which is all over my direct dial contact picture icon on the homescreen of my android spectrum smartphone. The contact list is on gmail. </p>
<p> Thanks, my compliments for this very nice information. I’m kind of old fashioned and want to buy an Android operated phone, with a regular qwerty key board as well as with a touch screen. I heard that Android phones don’t have the option to ad dial speed function to the real keys. Is this correct, or do you have information regarding this. Thx. in advance. </p>
<p> I discovered your blog site on google and verify a number of of your early posts. Proceed to maintain up the superb operate. I simply further up your RSS feed to my MSN Information Reader. Searching for forward to reading more from you afterward!… </p>
<p> The information is of course useful. You may accidentally touch on the icon to initiate a call. For this you can conveniently have these icons on the second, more preferably on the last home screen. If anybody can give me an idea as to how I can change the shape of the ‘direct dial’ icon from its square shape to round ones, without installing another application – that plays with the original contact list – it will be helpful. I have recently observed that many applications that are involved in using the the original contact list, makes the contact list sticky and more over the system hangs many a times. </p>
<p> Shape of the direct dial icons can be changed but you need to hire an programmer for this. </p>
<p> I thought this feature was there from the beginning, and not a new feature added now. At least I used it almost 6-7 months ago, when I bought my SGS2. </p>
<p> WARNING: I have found a inconvenience using this feature. Lot of times I accidentally press the Home Screen. And many times when my kids or friends use the phone, they also press the Home Screen, just to see what happens. (I think this can happen to everybody). And if the Direct Dial option is used, then the dialing takes place immediately. And we have to cut the call. This causes lot of inconvenience to the person whom we have called (he gets a MISSED CALL!!). After noticing this, I have discontinued using this feature. </p>
<p> Hi, I have got a new Samsung i9001, wanted to know how can i change the default application installation location from phone internal storage to phone’s usb storage directly permanently. Kindly let me know step by step procedure to do this. </p>
<p> hi, This facility (Add Direct Dials Contacts on Homescreens with Shortcuts to your Phone Contacts)is available in my Samsung Ace (GT-S5830),which run on Android 2.3.4 version (GINGERBREAD.DDKQ6). Now 2 days before I have upgraded my phone’s software to GINGERBREAD.DDKQ8 and this facility is availabe in that also. Can you tell me if this is a added facility by Samsung or a original Android’s? Thanks. </p>

<p> earlier we read article about android security that it leaves username/password in a text file!!! so is that safe to use your confidential credentials on android? </p>
<p> Yes, its safe to use it until users are careless to leave their password open to all. </p>
<p> Fine. if we make hard reset and on.the phone which gmail should we put for authetication small doubt </p>

Check out the review of Camera Effects Android application that we have tried. </p>
<p> Camera Effects is a nice Android application which allows you to take photos and add amazing effects on the photos which are taken.

The effects which are including like Holga, Lomo, Black and white, thermal, camera filter and effects. Also with those affects you get an instant preview of all the effects which can be applied to the photo which you have taken. The feature of zoom is the one which I have liked much. Under odd lighting or low lighting conditions this application is best for photos as it would provide good results for you. </p>
<p> This is a normal photo which I have taken from my phone camera – </p>
<p> This is one photo where I have added the featured called zoom in where the centre of the photo is zoomed in. This looks really cool but not in this photo. </p>

You are just a tap away to start recording of the videos and this app opens the videos in 352 x 288 pixel video screen size which is the recommended one.

<p> I don’t get it. I’ve been using the gmail app since day one (the day i bought the handset) and have set the signature since then. original roms, CM7 and miui, all are the same. no extra app needed. </p>

<p> How to Add Trusted Places on Android Lollipop to Smart Lock </p>
<p> The Smart Lock feature in the new version of Android lets you automatically turn off the security layer when you’re at home or the office or anywhere else you regularly go. </p>
<p> Now, Google has introduced a new option based on your location. Android users can now set “safe” locations in which your device will remain unlocked. So, once you leave that location, your device will lock and require your security code or pattern to be entered. </p>
<p> Before setting up a location for Smart Lock, you need to enable Smart Lock first. </p>
<p> Steps to enable Smart Lock – </p>
<p> Step 1 – Sync your phone or tablet with a Bluetooth device. Step 2 – After pairing a Smart Lock notification will appear on your phone or tablet once the two devices have been paired. Now tap where it says “Add as a trusted device” . Step 3- Click on the Plus icon (located at the bottom of the screen), select whether it is a Bluetooth or NFC device. Step 4 – Choose the device you would like to use. </p>
<p> Steps to Add Trusted Places for Smart Lock – </p>
<p> Step 1 – Launch the Settings app. Step 2 – Select the Security from the list. Step 3 – Tap on Smart Lock followed by Trusted Places. (If you don’t see Trusted Places as an option, then perhaps you have to wait until the Play Services update will push to your device.) Step 4 – If you’ve already entered your Home and Work locations into Google Maps or Google Now, you will find them listed with a toggle switch next to each one. To activate either area, toggle the switch. Step 5 – Select Add trusted place if you want to add somewhere other than your home or work address. </p>

<p> How to Add words to Android Phone User Dictionary </p>
<p> There are certain words which you commonly use and those words are not present in the English dictionary present on your phone. Or the language that you speak is different from your default language of your phone. Not sure of others but I prefer to go with mix of Hindi language with English, my idea is to type as fast as possible when I am messaging to others. Whenever I come across a new word not recognized for auto completion of words, I add it to dictionary so that whenever I want to use it again it comes in the auto complete text field smartly done by my Android phone. </p>
<p> Here are the two methods by which you can add words to the user dictionary – </p>
<p> Method 1 – </p>
<p> In this method, you don’t need do anything. You just have to keep on writing in the message or in email and whenever you enter that word which is not recognized by your phone, just long press on the word and tap on “Add to dictionary”. </p>
<p> That’s it! The next time when you are using that particular word, it would appear in auto complete suggestions, perfect for me. </p>
<p> Method 2 – </p>
<p> The users can also add words to the dictionary by simply going to the phone settings and then selecting the option of User dictionary under the option of Language and Keyboard settings. When you are on to it then press on Menu and add the word. This method manually requires you to exit for the work that you are doing and then add it manually in the settings. </p>
<p> Preferably, I would suggest you to go with the first method which mentioned above as its easy and doesn’t require any extra work to be done. This option is included in all the Android mobile phone but not just the Samsung Galaxy S2 mobile phone which I have used. </p>

<p> Bharti Airtel, the #1 telecom operator in India believes in customer service. This is why they are innovative all the time and today they have come up with a new innovation by launching their own navigation service app called the Smart Drive. We have seen many of the navigation based apps in the recent past and out of them we just love the Google Map’s navigation system. </p>
<p> Nothing big as discovery but this service from Airtel customers features the voice based turn by turn navigation and update on traffic in real time. While you are on this app you should make sure that GPS receiver is Switched ON. Once that is done you can easily start the route for navigation directions by performing a search on your favorite route and then choose the preferred mode of transport like drive or walk. And depending up on the GPS strength and connectivity you will get turn by turn voice guidance automatically once your press the start. </p>
<p> The application provides the various color code to understand the traffic on a particular road </p>
<p> Red – implying heavy traffic </p>
<p> Yellow – Medium and </p>
<p> Green – Free flow of traffic </p>
<p> The real time traffic on this app works showing the current traffic information on the maps. On this app, wherever there is traffic, it will be shown with green/yellow and red showing the nature of the traffic. The traffic map will be shown on both the directions of the road. The traffic information provided by this app is almost accurate enough. </p>
<p> Charges </p>
<p> This is a free to download app only limited for search and map viewing absolutely with no charge but for navigation and live traffic you need to pay daily or monthly subscription fee which as follows – </p>
<p> Navigation: Daily pack – Rs/10 per day Monthly pack – Rs. 99 per month </p>
<p> Live traffic Daily pack – Rs.3/day Monthly pack – Rs.49 per month </p>
<p> Please note that the subscribed pack will automatically be renewed. </p>

<p> Alleged Leaked Picture of the LG G3 – Quad HD display and Snapdragon 801 Processor – Details </p>
<p> The upcoming flagship from LG, the LG G3 has showed up on the AnTuTu benchmark set. More likely to be the company’s new flagship device, it has leaked itself giving us some of its features to cherish which set to be a high spec device and will be coming in to market expecting to compete with many high end devices like the Samsung Galaxy S5, Xperia Z2 and HTX M8 devices. </p>
<p> The pictured that got leaked revels that the device will be having multi-touch display with a resolutions of 1440 x 2560 with 640 dpi (display screen density). It is more likely it will be coming with a 5.5 inch screen and with the resolutions mentioned, it can give up to 538ppi pixel density making it the first Android device to cross the 500ppi line. </p>
<p> Other specifications that leaked include the GPU (graphics processing unit) that will be a Qualcomm Adreno 330 and will also be powered by the latest Snapdragon 801 processor that is seen in the flagship of Samsung and also in the Xperia Z2. From the rumored specs of the device we can see a 3 GB of RAM included to the device along with a 13 MP sensor on the back with OIS+ technology. </p>
<p> We have already seen the 5.5 inch panel from LG with Quad HD resolutions, so we can easily expect this flagship device also to sport the same. The Oppo Find 7 that was announced few weeks earlier also has the Quad HD display so we can expect many devices to follow it now. It is more likely that device will be coming on to screens very soon and LG might unveil this device any time soon. I am pretty much excited to see a Quad HD resolution on the Smart phones and hopefully we can see them soon. What do you think of this device? Are you waiting for it? Drop your comments below. </p>

<p> Amazon Android Tablet – Will it Beat Google or iPad? </p>
<p> Few months back we told you guys that Amazon soon will be launching an Android Tablet after the huge success of their market place where they offered paid games like Angry Birds for free. The recent news is that Amazon has ordered a large number of tablets through some Asian Manufacturer which is later going to be offered for sale by October. </p>
<p> Now the major questions is that will this tablet survive? Because Amazon has always been into the ebooks market along with their Kindle series and if their new tablet is priced at around $299 price range then it can for sure be a big hit along with being a threat to Apple iPad and all the currently sold Google Tablets in the market. Again at this price range you cannot expect some great hardware specifications and if Amazon starts selling these tablets at around $499 price range then consumers would tend to go towards Apple iPad and not to these new entrants. </p>
<p> One option would be that Amazon would sell their tablets at huge loss initially to get a decent market share and then start earning back from the apps sold through their market place, but this strategy would be hard to survive when we talk about millions of units planned to be sold. Along with this if it’s priced at par with the iPad or current android tablets then who would be interested in buying these when the apps offered are exactly the same as offered in Andypad, Asus Padfone, Galaxy Tab, HCL ME, Sony Android Tablets etc </p>
<p> The Tablet would be in 9″ or 10.1 ” screen size options without a camera which gives us a hint that you should be expecting a lower priced tablet. The whole team is expecting to sell this device with their large consumer base easily but it seems like it would be pretty hard because of the huge competition in the market as of now. May be Amazon is more towards beating Nook Color and not behind iPad because beating the Apple product would be real hard considering its being in the market from years. Along with this the product planned to be sold without camera would be one of the biggest reason for it to fail because even if users won’t use that camera heavily they still would expect the same for video calling or capturing snaps once in a while. </p>
<p> Overall would you be interested in buying a tablet from Amazon when there are many other options available in the market or would you just keep the product in your wish list so that someone would gift it to your on your birthday? </p>

<p> Amazon Black Friday 2013 Deal: HP Slate 2800 7-Inch 8 GB for $128 </p>
<p> The Black Friday is here and every store online and offline would try to provide you the best deals for the products in every category, and we would try to share you the best deals of the Android devices. One of them already listed with a limited number is the HP Slate 2800 Android tablet, a 7-inch one with the 1024 x 600 pixels resolution. </p>
<p> The best part of this is that you get around 40% of discount on this tablet, because the original price of the HP Slate 2800 is $220 and you are getting it for $128, which is quite a good deal, if you are in search for a decent 7-inch Android tablet, though we won’t be comparing this with the Asus Nexus 7, which is any time a better device, but the pricing during Black Friday doesn’t seem to change much. There are two cameras in the HP Slate, the rear one having a 3-megapixel lens, but you shouldn’t be expecting much from both the cameras. </p>
<p> There’s a 1.6 GHz ARM dual-core CORTEX A9 OMAP 4 processor with a 1GB DDR3 RAM, and there is an internal storage of 8GB. It runs the Android 4.1 Jelly Bean OS, and the tablet has quite well received a lot of appreciation for the normal usage, and although there is Beats Audio built-in, it isn’t up to the mark. It plays the games like Angry Birds, Subway Surfers pretty well and that would be quite enough to gift it to someone who doesn’t expect a lot from a tablet device than to keep in touch and entertainment through games and movies. </p>
<p> There are such several deals already available on Amazon, and we would be sharing them throughout this week, because the stores have started keeping the deals available till the coming Monday, rather than making the users hurry and purchase them only on Friday. Do check out the various Black Friday 2013 deals as soon as we list more of them. </p>

<p> Amazon Black Friday 2013 Deal: Lenovo Ideatab A1000 7-Inch Tablet for $74.99 [42% discount] </p>
<p> Amazon has listed the Lenovo A series Ideatab, the Lenovo A1000 for a price of just $74.99 as a part of the Black Friday 2013 promotion. That’s an awesome deal right now, because getting something very decent to use with one of the latest OS versions, not the Gingerbread that still stays in some budget devices, is something to look out for. The Lenovo Ideatab A1000 is a 7-inch Android tablet that runs the Android 4.1 Jelly Bean OS and it has got some very decent specifications. The price at which the official DO Lenovo store sells it, is $124.79 after the eCoupon application, but the price at which Amazon is selling it, is just $74.99 which makes it a whooping discount of around 40%. </p>
<p> We just shared the Black friday deal of HP Slate 2800 in which the tablet was available for $128, but this one is even better, again only for those who don’t want to do a lot of stuff with a tablet device than just the normal gaming and networking. It’s an 8GB tablet and you can add up to 32GB of external storage to it, especially if you are looking to have a good database of movies and songs for entertainment. The Ideatab A1000 is powered by the MediaTek 8317 Dual Core 1.2 GHz processor and there is 1GB of RAM. </p>
<p> Having the USB On-the-go support, this tablet would make it possible to read the optical flash drives. The 72 percent color gamut screen with the 1024 x 600 pixels display resolution provides a good color output. There is no camera on the rear side, and the A1000 has a VGA front camera for the video calling, and the connectivity options included are the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth etc. and although there is no mention about the battery included, the company claims that it provides around 7 hours of usage on a single charge. </p>
<p> The deal looks good, and actually better than the many other deals available right now, because a mere $75 is what gets you a brand new tablet device with no crappy inclusions. </p>

<p> Analog keyboard from Microsoft gets Released for Android Wear – Details </p>
<p> Microsoft has recently released a prototype version of the keyboard for Android Wear called Analog Keyboard. Microsoft’s Analog Keyboard lets you enter text by drawing handwritten letters on a smart watch screen. Google hasn’t built it own keyboard for Android Wear yet. </p>
<p> The keyboard supports square screens with a 320 x 320 resolution and the Moto 360(LG G Watch is incompatible due to its low resolution.). You can draw letters and even special characters and numbers freely. </p>
<p> Microsoft has provided some usage tips for optimize use of the app. First thing that you have to keep in mind is that only lower case letters are supported as of now. The software will not recognize letters in upper case. </p>
<p> Microsoft has programmed the Analog Keyboard such that, the frequently used words will be auto-corrected by the software as user will complete his typing of characters and will make the whole process faster. Long press of the backspace key has been assigned for repeating the function. </p>
<p> How does it work? </p>
<p> When you tap in a text field on the watch, the Analog Keyboard fills the screen. Then, you start drawing characters, one by one. As you do, a text field at the top fills in to show what you’ve typed. There are back and Space keys to the sides of the typing area, and you can tap a done button to submit your entry. As with the virtual keyboards in Windows Phone, it makes typing suggestions as you go. </p>
<p> Installing Analog Keyboard is bit tedious. It requires installing Android SDK on your PC and a working adb (Android debug bridge) connection to your watch. Also, as the Moto 360 does not have a USB connector, you need to setup Bluetooth debugging for installing the app. </p>
<p> With the release of this app, Windows is exploring handwriting recognition for text input on small touch screens. On soft keyboards, many keys shares the small touch surface, but by using handwriting methods the entire screen will </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Get Android 4.2-like Quick Settings in Notification Panel in your Android Phone </p>
<p> Android 4.2 Jelly Bean OS came in with some excellent modifications, and one of them was the Quick Settings section in the Notification Panel which brings loads of options, which you would usually keep exploring in the Settings app if you wanted a change in any. For those using the previous OS versions, even the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich who wondered whether they could play around with such quick settings and options, there’s an App which could bring something totally similar – Control Panel for Android. </p>
<p> The Control Panel for Android does the same which comes as a default option in the Android 4.2 OS version, with a Quick Settings shortcut in the notification panel, which opens a grid view of settings from various sections – Display, Connectivity, Sound, Rotation etc. Of course one of the annoying things with the Internet turned on, is that you would see Ads in the bottom while using the app, but you can’t expect everything for free when craving to use something that the latest OS has got. </p>
<p> The grid options that open up on clicking the Quick Settings shortcut: </p>
<p> Bluetooth – Turning Bluetooth On/Off </p>
<p> Sound – Turning Sound On/Off for notifications </p>
<p> Haptic Feedback – Vibrating feedback to touch </p>
<p> Dial tone – Dial tone turning on/off </p>
<p> Screen Timeout – Setting up the screen timeout time </p>
<p> Ringtone – Setting the ringtone </p>
<p> Volume – Setting up the Volume for System, Music, In-call, Ringer, Notification, Alarm </p>
<p> Ring mode – Ring, with Vibrate, Vibrate only or Silent </p>
<p> Brightness – Setting Brightness level </p>
<p> The things don’t end here, as clicking on the Android Robot below the options, would take you to other sections where you would find categorized settings, but we won’t be noticing it much because if someone had to hit and reach such deep options, it’s nothing different than the direct Settings app in the Android phone. Still, if you have had a feeling always that the Settings area is always confusing, the Control Panel has categories such as – Sound – This section has the settings for ringtone, notification, alarm, volume, ring mode and All Sound Settings Network – Settings for Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi IP, Bluetooth, GPS, Data, Airplane Mode, Carrier, APN and Accounts Display / Others – Brightness, Screen timeout, Locale, Date and Time, Input settings, Applications, Developer, Storage, Privacy, Battery Usage </p>
<p> The Control Panel can be customized with the various colors – Light, Dark, Green, Blue and Red. The user can choose whether to have the notification icon active or whether they need to manually go to the settings and open the control panel when they want to change any settings, but that would not solve the actual purpose of having the Quick Settings in the Notification Panel. </p>
<p> We’ve used it with frequent option changes and noticed no lag in performance, and it just looks like one of the default options the Android phone would have. A selected option would show an outline around it, while the others are just the simple boxes. One of the good things about the Control Panel app is that it works for all the Android versions from Android 2.2 Froyo, so doesn’t matter if you are on Froyo, Gingerbread (and its various updates), Ice Cream Sandwich and even the Android 4.1 Jelly Bean OS, the apps works perfectly in all the devices. </p>
<p> You can download the Control Panel for Android from the Google Play Store or go here to download the APK if you want to install it by yourself. </p>

<p> Android 4.4.1 KitKat Update for Nexus 5 Brings Camera Improvement [Update Info] </p>
<p> The Android 4.4 KitKat update wasn’t perfect already, is what one can sense from the new 4.4.1 update which comes with several improvements to the camera in the Nexus 5 from Google. We did complain about the camera, but felt that the 8-megapixel shooter could do nothing more than that, but Google knew that the Nexus 5 could do much better with the camera with the software tweaks, and thus the Android 4.4.1 update is being sent. This update is being rolled out for even the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 7 LTE 2013 edition. </p>
<p> The camera update comes in different sections, and these are divided as: </p>
<p> Autofocus fixing </p>
<p> Speeding up the performance of the camera app </p>
<p> More contrast and vibrant colours in the photographs </p>
<p> Better exposure, and the white balance </p>
<p> Changes to the interface of the camera app </p>
<p> There is even ability to pinch-zoom the viewfinder added in the HDR+ mode, and the shutter lag has been reduced. Although the update is being sent to the three devices, the main advantage can be taken by only the Nexus 5 devices because the 4.4.1 for the other two Nexus devices does just a few bug fixes. </p>
<p> According to The Verge, fixing the autofocus has already fixed a few other issues too, and fixing the motion blur is also a possibility now. The pictures are surely going to look more lively and vibrant, instead of how they dull they look right now. The Verge has done a few tests with the camera and the changes look brilliant. We would update you as soon as the update is received and we do the tests to check out the changes made in the camera app. </p>
<p> It would be an OTA update sent anytime to your devices, so keep your Nexus 5 connected to the Internet to see the update popup. If eagerm you can manually check for the update by going to Settings > About and manually see if there is an update available already. </p>
<p> Recently, Motorola too had sent an OTA update for Moto X camera improvements, which too had a lot of software adjustments to make the capture quality better. </p>

<p> Android 4.4.3 KitKat OS Update for Samsung Galaxy S5, Note 3 Coming Soon – Details </p>
<p> We know that Samsung is preparing its own software version based on Android 4.4.3 and its getting ready to push it to its flagship device, Samsung Galaxy S5 and also to the Galaxy Note 3 device. These will the first devices that will be getting this Android 4.4.3 build. We have seen the company releasing the LTE-A variant of the Samsung Galaxy S5 in its home country and the rumors of the Note 4 are already buzzing around the ears. </p>
<p> A document that has been leaked claims that the Android 4.4.3 update for the Samsung Galaxy S5 (both the Snapdragon and Exynos versions) have been confirmed and will be hitting the devices before the end of this month. On the other hand the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is still under development stage and has reached the final testing stage and if the test is successful then the update for the Galaxy Note 3 should start the roll out in the next month. </p>
<p> We got the leaked documents last month noting that Galaxy S5’s update was still under working and I guess it has been finalized now. Noticeable thing the image is the font that looks to be manipulated so we are not sure if these are really some proofs for the Android 4.4.3 updates. Today we have seen Google pushing the Android 4.4.4 update to its Nexus line of device fixing the security bug. So we are not sure if these devices will get the 4.4.3 update or will it be a direct bump to the Android 4.4.4 KitKat? That will be delaying the release of this update further more. </p>
<p> So what are you expecting? Android 4.4.3 or Android 4.4.4 KitKat? We are already getting the news on Google plans on the next version of the Android 5.0 that could be released in the early 4th quadrant of this year. Well we need to wait and see until the company announces these updates officially. </p>

<p> Open the Settings app </p>
<p> Scroll to the bottom and tap on About phone </p>
<p> Tap on system updates </p>
<p> Tap on “Check for update” </p>
<p> Updates tend to roll out in stages, so it might be a little while before you have access to the update yourself. </p>
<p> Earlier : Motorola Rolling Out Android 5.0 “Lollipop” to Moto X (2014) and Moto G (2014) – Details Date – Nov 13,2014 Motorola has put up a posting on their blog, announcing the beginning of their Android Lollipop rollout for their new Moto X and Moto G. Currently the update is rolling out in phases to the following three versions of those devices: </p>
<p> Moto X (2nd Gen.) Pure Edition </p>
<p> Moto G (2nd Gen.) US GSM </p>
<p> Moto G (2nd Gen.) Global GSM retail versions sold in the US </p>
<p> Since these updates are rolling out in phases, it may take some time for Lollipop to make its way onto your Moto X or Moto G. Other manufacturers including HTC and LG have indicated they plan to release the latest version of Android in the coming weeks. </p>
<p> Earlier : Motorola Rolling Out Android 5.0 “Lollipop” to Moto X (2014) Pure Edition via Soak Test – Details Date – 8 Nov. 2014 Motorola had posted the release notes for Lollipop on the 2014 Moto X yesterday, but they were immediately pulled down. Android 5.0 is currently rolling out to Moto X owners who signed up for the smartphone’s “soak test” and could see a wider release should they not report any glaring errors. The decision to pull down the pages describing the update could mean that Motorola jumped the gun, and will not officially roll out the software for a few days. The first Moto X model to receive Android 5.0 is Motorola’s unlocked “Pure Edition”. </p>
<p> According to Motorola’s release notes, the update includes the following new features and tweaks: • Material Design • Notifications UI & Priorities • New Interruptions & Downtime Settings • Recent Apps (Multitasking) • Moto Display and Ambient Display • Motorola Assist and Downtime • Flashlight • Share your Device • Pin a view/app • Battery • Smarter Internet Connections • Performance • Smart Lock (Trusted Devices) • Security </p>
<p> Earlier this week, Motorola was surveying prospective soak testers about a new update which was assumed to be Android 5.0 Lollipop. Motorola didn’t take to their usual forums to post their release notes detailing all the goodies you can expect when you update your Moto X (2014) to Android 5.0 Lollipop. </p>
<p> Motorola has been faster than any other manufacturer, outside of Google’s Nexus program, to offer Android updates on its smartphones since it was owned by the search giant. Motorola, now owned by Lenovo, has continued to tinker with the operating system less than other manufacturers. </p>
<p> Google has delayed the Android 5.0 Lollipop update for the Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 7 and Nexus 10. It will now roll out on November 12; exactly a week after it was initially meant to launch. Google has decided to delay the update in order to iron out some last minute bugs. Apparently there are a couple of necessary fixes required before the system is ready to be rolled out to older Nexus devices. The Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 are the first to run Android Lollipop. </p>

<p> The Ice Cream Sandwich unveils some of the additional features like NFC sharing and one thing which would be talking in this section is the Android Beam feature. </p>
<p> What is Android Beam? </p>
<p> The Android Beam is an NFC based technology with which you can quickly share webpages, videos, apps, pictures by simply tapping the two phones together within the reach of NFC range. You can also share other important data like files with other enabled devices. </p>
<p> This feature also works to share Google Maps information, video being watched on YouTube, contact information and application which you are browsing on your browser can also be shared. </p>
<p> Sharing Content with Android Beam </p>
<p> Suppose if you are browsing video on YouTube on one of the NFC phone you can easily share with the other NFC enabled device. </p>
<p> You just simply need to touch to beam and then bring the device closer to each other to make the same content available on the other phone. </p>
<p> Android Beam Limitations </p>
<p> And importantly Android Beam would be the feature which would be only available on the NFC module enabled device and it wouldn’t be available on all the Android phones. But looks like slowly we would see more number of device coming with NFC module as its just adding a chip with relevant program on the existing phones. We have listed few of the Android NFC enabled phones and along with that we have also provided a listed of upcoming NFC enabled devices whose count will grow by this year end. </p>

<p> The mobile accessibility lite is that application which will serve the blind in better ways.

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Android BootManager – Speed up Phone Boot by Disabling Apps on Start Up </p>
<p> The Android OS has made quite a good progress by now with the new KitKat version too coming out soon, but there’s some issues that the users find always, especially with the speed of the interface which although isn’t that slow but several applications running in the background eventually slow down the entire interface. To speed up the phone bootup and the interface, there’s an App which can serve a good purpose: Android BootManager. This is actually an App module which needs the device to be rooted and on the X-pose Framework to work. </p>
<p> Just like any other Mobile OS or even the Windows / Mac OS, there are certain applications that start working whenever the device boots up, and you need to stop them to see a faster bootup. There is an app permission: “android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED” which is placed in a startup folder and from there you would normally see a notification from the running app, or the app would automatically start in the background or if the user has set an option, the app would exit. </p>
<p> Disabling the app in the BootManager would prevent the app from starting up at the next system boot, and that is what you are actually looking at with this app. When the app is started for the first time, it would list all the apps set to run upon every boot of the Android OS. There’s a difference between the free and paid version of the app, and there’s no paid version but you need to make an in-app donation to unlock the features. </p>
<p> The free app would give you the list and options to disable the app only for the user-installed apps but not the system apps. The in-app donation (you can indirectly call the paid app option) would open the various options to check and stop the system apps from opening on the device boot up. Once you have made an in-app donation, the working would be easy, where you just need to tap on the particular app which you want to disable, and it would become a red selection which would not start on the system boot up. </p>
<p> You still won’t be able to control the entire bootup time, because it is the ROM in the device on which the boot up speed is dependent, but you can fasten it up in your own way to a certain limit, which is still good. </p>
<p> The developer of the app has even given some info about ReceiverStop, which is another module which would prevent the apps from working even after the system boot up. This is to stop the events which have made the app to start up after the boot up. For example, there’s a permission called “android.permission.MOUNT_UNMOUNT_FILESYSTEMS” which would start the Skype app after the start up if it is installed in the device, because there’s an SD card inserted to run the processes. ReceiverStop would prevent even those processes from running after the boot up is done. </p>
<p> Download the app for free from the Android Play Store: Link </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Android Customisation 101 – Changing Wallpapers </p>
<p> The first thing you will probably want to do after purchasing your new Android is to do some basic customization. This starts with changing the wallpaper. Sure, the wallpaper that comes with the phone may be nice and shows off the resolution and colour range of the display. However, we all want something that is uniquely us when we are customising a device. You have a few options in this regard. You can search the web for something to set as the wall paper or you might have a range of wall papers already set into the phone – however these are likely to be fairly generic things such as flowers or scenic vistas. For those of us who prefer something a little edgier, we will want something like a pirate flag or a liger. </p>
<p> So we want a picture of a liger. We will need to do a web search to find the right picture or we will have to dig up a picture from our computer. It is easy enough to transfer a file from our computer using a USB cable. It is equally as easy to get an image from the internet. Just search the web on your phone, press the image you want to save until the menu shows up and save the image. Now go through the gallery app, select the image and set it as wall paper. Simple really – however you don’t have to go through the gallery to change the wall paper. Your phone should have the option to change the wall paper through your generic phone options. </p>
<p> You might want to keep a theme going. The phone is likely to have a range of themes at your disposal. Choose the theme and customise it. I prefer using one of the phones generic themes and then altering the back ground image. It is pretty easy to do and keeps a theme going in the phone. The theme may center on a colour scheme or a specific topic. You can also download new themes for most Android phones out there. Because most companies utilise their own interface scheme it is worth having a good look around for a theme that suits you then customising it. You will be able to change the colors of specific interface items with the majority of Android phones on the market. </p>
<p> Depending on the version of Android the phone utilizes you might have different options available. If you have an older Android version then you might be a little more limited in regards to customizing the interface. However, it doesn’t mean you can’t set the wall paper to something that represents what you want it to represent. Consider the phone an extension of your personality or abilities. You want to make the phone speak volumes of what you represent. This sounds a little cheesy – but why else do we want to customise everything? So, it is a pretty easy way to customise your phone and likely the first thing you will want to alter when you get your new phone. </p>

<p> Android Customisation 101 – Tailoring Ringtones </p>
<p> One thing you will probably focus on when customising your Android is finding a ringtone that speaks volumes of your personality. You will want something represents you and your phone in the most fitting manner possible. You might want to cut a specific section of a song out because it has the groove that best let’s people around you know that you are on the wavelength of awesome. There is an app available on the Market and AppBrain called RingDroid. RingDroid adds some pretty neat functionality to the whole ringtone selection process. It has a built in WAV editor that allows you to cut out any part of any DRM free song. </p>
<p> Following is a basic list of steps to follow in order to achieve the pinnacle of cool with your chosen song or section of song that you want to use to represent how awesome you are: </p>
<p> Firstly you will need to grab a copy of RingDroid from the Market or AppBrain. Installing it into your phone is pretty straight forward. Once it is on your phone and you access it you are ready for the next step. </p>
<p> Open up RingDroid and open up the song that you want to edit. You will be presented with an editing screen, play the song to see how it works (in the event you have never used a WAV editor). </p>
<p> Now you will need to set start and stop markers to essentially cut the section out of the song that you wish to use. You will want something about 10-30 seconds long for a ringtone and something less than 10 seconds for a notification sound. Placing the start and stop markers are pretty straight forward things to do. Play around with it a bit to get your head around how it works – you can’t wreck anything. </p>
<p> Once you have made your selection, navigate to the menu and hit save. There is a little save icon down the bottom of the interface, alternatively you can just hit that. </p>
<p> When the save screen pops up you can choose what you want to use the sound for. The options consist of ringtone, notification, alarm or music. Type in a unique name for the sound and hit save. </p>
<p> Now you can use the sample for what you need it for. It will ask if you would like to set it as the default sound for what you said you wanted it for as it saves and this can save you a little time in setting it manually. If you want to change it at a later date then you can go to the main phone menu, hit settings and select the sounds and display option. </p>
<p> RingDroid is a great little app for setting ringtones because it allows you to totally customize what you want the sample to be. You don’t have to set a 3 minute song as a notification sound and it will open virtually any sound file as long as it is DRM free. </p>

<p> They will not upgrade Samsung Galaxy W i8150 to ICS because they are afraid that we will not buy their new 2012 phones. I am NOT buying anymore nor will advise anyone to buy samsung phones. They have BAD BAD android supports for their clients. Very disappointing and I switched back to iphone. </p>

<p> Incorrect details about LG Optimus 2X update was written Willn’t get ICS Update But confirmed ICS UPDATE Q2 2012 for LG Optimus 2X </p>
<p> Thanks for update. Just confirmed that LG Optimus 2X will receive the ICS update as first it was rumoured that it will not receive. </p>
<p> May I know when will get ICS 4.0 for SII GT-I9100G? any official announcement, thanks </p>
<p> there is no ETA on the same! But if it arrives, we will surely come up with the same! </p>
<p> My Samsung Galaxy Pro (rooted) is not starting (shown the first screen – SAMSUNG) even i done wipeout factory reset… Can you help me </p>
<p> How is it their is no update for galaxy sl oh!! comon it has 496mb ram and an awesome 1ghz processor and it has the capabilities to run ICS I am so dissapinted with Samsung really they are lazy!! please tel me der will be ICS update for my phone… </p>
<p> I believe that Q1 for the final release of efficient ICS is reasonable. The Beta for Galaxy S2 has been tested and still has 70% room for improvement. Many of the functions does not work i.e Camera, Detection of SD ad External SD, Plenty of Force Closes. I say, better be patient and have a full working OS than something that is half cooked and we end up blaming Google or Samsung for our impatience. </p>
<p> It’s too bad that samsung galaxy W doesn’t get update for ICS officially 🙁 While xperia neo, get ICS update. </p>
<p> Is samsung galaxy pro is not getting any updates even in unoffcially [i rooted this model] </p>
<p> please explain wat do u mean that samsung galaxy s plus will be gettin the ics upgrade unofficially </p>
<p> Are third parties developers working on ICS 4.0.3 for Galaxy S i9000?I don’t get it why Google Nexus S is getting official update and Galaxy s i9000 don’t?both phones run same CPU and RAM </p>
<p> is dere gonna be an official ics for samsung galaxy sl i9003… because dere is an alpha version out for it… </p>
<p> The hardware should support the Ice Cream Sandwich with smooth scrolling and your phone should be with good graphical acceleration. </p>
<p> I know there has been little information regarding ICS getting upgraded to Samsung Galaxy W’s but I am not familiar with how these updates happen (I’m only looking into stuff for santa presents so I’m a bit lost..). Is it likely that it will be updated due it beening quite recent? </p>
<p> Claiming that Galaxy R will get ICS….and the adding unofficially is highly misleading. First of all Samsung Galaxy R is probably one of the least popular phones among developers right now. (Plus it’s not even properly promoted by Samsung e.g. there’s no way to find it on the most of national websites). The only meaningful resource that belongs Samsung Galaxy R is the impressive army of ordinary users that nobody gives a shit about. So to sum up: things are going really wrong with our device. It’s safe to state that there’s no aftermarket development at all in the moment. So it’s really doubtful we’ll get anything sooner unofficially than officially. Officially we’re enjoying 🙁 GB 2.3.4 in Europe, unofficially we’ve got one custom kernel so far. I don’t want to be misunderstood guys. I appreciate the job you do here. But how can anybody say that we’ll get ICS unofficially in such circumstances? </p>
<p> if that is what u mean, there’s no reason to inform us about that, and that is understood that they will develop roms. the question here is are they going to make official SAMSUNG updates or not! </p>
<p> Officially is by the phone manufacturer, custom ROM are available for Android 4.0 for most of the phones they are not official ones. </p>
<p> That is what is describe on the table above (Official Launch) </p>
<p> will there be upgrade to new android 4 ice cream sandwich in samsung galaxy s plus???? coz i m buying new samsung s plus…pls rply. </p>
<p> Samsung has announced that they will not update the Galaxy S and S plus with ICS. </p>
<p> Unofficially it will come but official one it has not been announced anything of the device from Samsung. </p>
<p> Thanks for yur update, as per above table Galaxy S II Yes December 2011 will get update ,is it applicable for S2 GT-I9100G. May I know what is n/w locked Handsend ? </p>
<p> May I know what is the latest official/unofficial version for Galaxy S2-GT I9100G . currently i have 2.3.4 </p>
<p> Thanks for yur update, as per above table Galaxy S II Yes December 2011 will get update ,is it applicable for S2 GT-I9100G. May I know what is n/w locked Handsend ? </p>
<p> maybe what they meant was that galaxy S variants such as the ones sold in north america rather than the S Plus. </p>
<p> as in Vibrant, Captivate, Epic 4G, fascinate, Mesmerize etc. Perhaps they class the S Plus as another phone all together. </p>
<p> You stated that Sony confirmed that all Xperia phones will get ICS, but I don’t see Xperia X10i in the list, will the X10 get the update too? </p>
<p> sad to see that I9003 wouldn’t get ICS update…How do u get the info?Do you sure that info is true? </p>
<p> How are you guys so sure of these dates? Just curious? This will help me make my decision on my next phone </p>
<p> We can’t comment on the dates, but be rest assured as soon as it comes we will let you know! </p>
<p> there are no clarifications as of now but once it arrives, we will let you know about the same! </p>
<p> Is there any possibilities that Samsung Galaxy W will got its ICS Upgrade ?? because of the specifications is more better than Xperia Neo V and that’s why i think Samsung Galaxy W should got its ICS Upgrade ! Thanks 😀 </p>
<p> How can find out when the ICS is available for HTC Wildfire S? or will it ever be available for the Wildfire S? </p>
<p> Meizu M8 can be updated to ICS? Is it true? As I know, M8 is based on windows CE and Meizu is not support it any more. </p>
<p> What about optimus 2x? Yesterday it had NO on your column “ICS Confirmation”, but now it’s changed to YES and even with exact date specified 🙂 </p>
<p> What about the LG Optimus V from virgin mobile? I have 2.2.1 froyo and want to update to ICS 4.0, is it possible? </p>
<p> Will the LG Optimus V from virgin mobile be able to update to ICS 4.0? I have 2.2.1 froyo now, and want to know if its possible </p>
<p> Nexus S is 2nd phone from Google. I’m expected to get first ICS update! Not Galaxy 2! </p>
<p> with 278 mg ram !? i have galaxy ace but i know there will not be update … ics has lot of ability that need more RAM </p>
<p> like showing g+ staus beside contact .. or others thing … </p>
<p> should change the phone ! ot get a cheapt asus tablet ! asus prime cost 500 dollar or previos trasnformet cost 450 $ . </p>

<p> you can install Custom ICS in your phone,,Please do not wait for original update for Galaxy mini because this is not possible </p>
<p> Thanks a ton for getting the stats. But dissapointed that Galaxy S has no confirmation 🙁 </p>
<p> There is no announcement from Samsung, so we have put “No confirmation” else its will be receiving the ICS update for sure. </p>
<p> I have updated my Galaxy Ace with DDKQ6. Can I root the phone? If so how to do it? </p>

<p> Android Ice Cream Sandwich for Tablets – A Massive fail? </p>
<p> The smartphone battle seems to have begun very recently and with a whole lot of tablets and mobile devices coming up recently, platforms are getting themselves ready to face the challenge and take on. Some have already called Android the winner, the Operating System which is barely a couple of years old. While emerging platforms like Windows Phone 7 and WebOS are coming up, the potential of these platforms are highly doubtful at this stage. However, Android seems to be doing really well if you look at the numbers. </p>
<p> The way the Operating System has been evolving is breathtaking. Gradually, from a small build on the T-mobile G1 to a whole ecosystem running on a plethora of devices with a ton developers working on them currently. Open Sourcing the Operating System was the root cause of this victory and the future of the OS is still not clear. Google is competing close with iOS on the mobile phone scenario, going above the iPhone on the sales charts of various regions around the world. However, Google’s Android based tablets have been sold in very very few numbers around the world. </p>
<p> Google never showed us how or what Ice Cream Sandwich would be and how it would integrate the Operating System on Tablets and Cellphones. The current fragmentation system has become silly and this isn’t their path for the future, that’s for sure. How did Apple do the tablet? They knew building a whole new ecosystem for tablets would not get them apps at the moment. But at the same time, resizing iPhone apps on the 10 incher wouldn’t look nifty too. The strategy they evolved to get developers make exclusive apps for the iPad and otherwise go for iPhone apps on the 2X mode seems to be working like a charm. Now, there are over 90,000 iPad exclusive apps on the App Store and it’s not been long since the first iPad launched.However, Google released a whole new operating system for their Tablets named Honeycomb recently and they’re already showcasing Ice Cream Sandwich, calling it the future of Android. </p>
<p> Manufacturers are disappointed and so are the Android fanboys who love it on their cellphones. Motorola spent a ton on the Xoom‘s R&D and marketing it but the sales charts have disappointed. Manufacturers like Acer and Lenovo entered the tablet segment with high hopes on Android but everything seems to be pointless at this stage. </p>
<p> I’m not sure if Google knows what it’s doing. Having just around 200 tablet apps on Honeycomb and trying to compete with a hundred thousand apps on iOS, shouldn’t they be taking every step to promote developers and widen their App Market? Instead, they just seem to make the whole scneario more hazy and confusing the developers. How are they going to create a universal ecosystem for Android(on tablets). Even if they would manage to, isn’t it already too late to compete with iOS? Or should they just quit the tablets? </p>
<p> You just don’t have the time, Google. You already seem to have lost it. Or let’s see if you could prove me wrong. </p>

<p> Android Keyboard Alternatives – Best Apps you can Download </p>
<p> For most of us, the Android’s integrated keyboard does the job. You are probably already aware that without a means of comfortably inputting data into your phone – your phone is little more than a paper weight which is awkward to use. You may not have any specific gripes with how well your Android’s keyboard works but just want to try something different or something that better suits the aesthetic appeal of your phone and keeps within the boundaries of any theme you have going on with your Android’s interface. Alternatively you may despise your Android’s keyboard and it is the one thing that is holding your Android back from being the ultimate smart phone. You need not worry if either of these things are what bothers you – you can always change the keyboard. </p>
<p> There are a variety of third party keyboard apps available. Following is a short list of some of the keyboard apps available: </p>
<p> 1. Swype </p>
<p> Probably the most well known of the alternate Android keyboards out there. Nice spacing and easy to use and implement keyboard. Most Android phones support this app and it is easy to change between this and other in built keyboards that your Android may have. </p>
<p> 2. Swiftkey </p>
<p> This is another pretty popular third party keyboard. It is a nice keyboard and relatively easy to use. I actually don’t see much of a difference in terms of functionality between this and Swype. It offers the same auto-complete function as Swype (similar to what you see offered by regular text messaging input solutions in older phones) although it is a little more advanced than what Swype offers. </p>
<p> 3. Better Keyboard </p>
<p> I actually use this myself – I have big fingers and find the keyboard that is offered by Better Keyboard a little more forgiving with my clumsy fingers. The buttons are slightly bigger than those offered by Swype and Swiftkey and I am less likely to hit the W or R key when trying to type anything that has an E in it. It also has a wide variety of themes (or skins) that you can set. The only realy down fall is that it requires a third party .apk file in order to utilise the auto-complete function if you don’t have the stock Android keyboard installed in your phone. </p>
<p> 4. Thick Buttons </p>
<p> Similar to Better Keyboard – but has even thicker (or bigger buttons). I have nothing against Thick Buttons as such but it didn’t grab me like Better Keyboard did. It offers pretty much the same functionality as the other keyboards but it seemed a little less responsive to the touch than the previously mentioned keyboards. </p>
<p> There are more keyboards out there and I probably haven’t covered the cream of the crop (however, Swiftkey and Swype seem to be the more popular third party options out there). Some people will find this information useless because they rely on voice input or are happy with the solutions offered with their phone. However, keyboards are important as a poor keyboard can be detrimental to our experiences with our phones. </p>

<p> Android KitKat 4.4 – The Deal between Google & Nestle – How and When </p>
<p> For those who were thinking that the new name for the next version of Google Android, i.e. Android 4.4 KitKat is something that happened all of a sudden, it’s not happened just recently. Google and Nestle had planned this earlier, in March when the Mobile World Congress was in progress, but both the companies kept the things confidential and kept continuing with the Key Lime Pie name to keep the users interested and unaware of the name that was to actually come into the scene. </p>
<p> Doesn’t the video above remind you of the Apple iPhone videos, which talks about innovation, details and stuff? yes Apple, you are the target here! </p>
<p> Google’s Sundar Pichai, the head of operations for Android, decided about this name, after feeling that Key Lime Pie is not known as a delicacy for many, and thus they wanted something which was more common. While talking to BBC News UK, both the companies said that they worked on the co-branding and kept the copyrights aside, and it took no more than an hour for the Nestle team to decide and agree with the mutual deal. </p>
<p> Nestle Marketing Chief Patrice Bula said that although they took this decision, it was always a risk but they wanted to jump into it. “Maybe I’ll be fired,” he said, “when you try to lead a new way of communicating and profiling a brand you always have a higher risk than doing something much more traditional. You can go round the swimming pool 10 times wondering if the water is cold or hot or you say: ‘Let’s jump.’ </p>
<p> And after they took the jump, both the companies met at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and finalized the details. The deal went private in a way that even most of the Googlers didn’t get to know about it until the new statue of KitKat was installed at the Google Headquarters in Mountain View. </p>
<p> Finally, even the Nestle team wanted to do something “fun and unexpected” and they got this not a “money-changing-hands kind of deal,” which would mutually benefit both the sides and eventually they aren’t paying anything to each other for this. And yes, Google, you would receive quite a lot of criticism for the name change, but Key Lime Pie is not as popular as KitKat, so a good marketing change! </p>
<p> With the IFA 2013 kicking off, Google could come up with a major announcement, and yes they did show a few people using some never-seen-before device in their hands capturing the KitKat statue, and this could be the Nexus 5, although LG confirmed that they aren’t going to come up with any major announcement in the coming days. </p>
<p> * As a part of the deal, KitKat bars that would now come will have special prizes where people can win the Nexus 7 tablets, or the different goodies if they luckily find it in the cover of the KitKat chocolate. </p>

<p> Android L Keyboard Available on Google Play for any Android Phone – Details, Download Link </p>
<p> It’s time for Android L now as the developer preview comes we also get the Android L keyboard on Google play store for free. This keyboard has been developed at XDA and it is available as a separate download. This keyboard will work on all the KitKat devices, either rooted or non-rooted. This app was launched by Shen Ye who is a XDA TV producer. This a good app since the Android L is buzzing around the market now and people will have the chance of previewing this version. </p>
<p> This app was launched few hours ago that is a part of the Android L developer preview that has been made available only for Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 devices. This app should be downloaded on to your device and installed and later should go to the Settings of your device and click on the Keyboard or the Language and Input and turn on the Android L Keyboard. After this go to the advance settings and change the colour scheme to material and you are done and ready to use it. </p>
<p> Now you can use this Android L keyboard as your default keyboard that is ready to be used after selecting it from the Notification bar. This is an elegant looking keyboard that has all the features like suggestions and the swipe features that we have seen with other regular keyboards. This will be working only on devices that run on Android KitKat operating system as we tested on devices that run Android Jelly Bean and although it got installed, there was nothing we could do to select it in the Settings. </p>
<p> The developer preview of the Android L is been updated on our devices and we would be coming with all the changes and new features that have come with this version. Google has not pointed out any particular date when this official update will be coming but we are sure it will be coming in the near future. The Android L Keyboard can be downloaded from the Google Play for free by clicking (here). </p>

<p> Hi, </p>
<p> Currently i am using 3.1.5 market on GT I9003, but whenever i am uninstalling – It again installs automatically and i am not able to install Market 3.1.6. </p>
<p> I am having some problem with market 3.1.5 – while updating the applications it shows white screen and not able to update the same. </p>
<p> Ok well Market 3.1.6 is not installing on my ace gt s5830 showing error ‘aplication is not install’. </p>
<p> Thanks guys..It works I am using Android market 3.1.5 in my Samsung Galaxy I5510. </p>
<p> Dear neal How we can select the our phone memory to download apk file in samsung galaxy ace gt s5830? I am ask it for replace the older system application with new one? </p>
<p> there is an issue with most of the phones, just wait till we come up with a probable solution!!! </p>
<p> I copied it to my phone, and clicked it to install, and same as above, it did not install. I even tried rebooting the phone, stopping the Market applicaion, and then installing again. No luck. </p>
<p> Seems to me they would have an automatic update for this since it is the preferred way to get apps for the device. </p>
<p> there is an issue with most of the phones, just wait till we come up with a probable solution! </p>
<p> So if we just wait awhile, Market will update itself to 3.1.6. I’m happy to wait. I don’t care for the “new” look anyway. </p>
<p> Hi Neal, I downloaded the APK file directly to my my Samsung Galaxy I9000, but I got the same “Not installed” message. Would really appreciate your help. </p>
<p> clear the cache of Market app from the manage apps and then try installing the new market again! </p>
<p> The Market mention cannot be install on my HTC Sensation. Also I check my version is 2.3.4 not 3.1.5. </p>
<p> I’m having the same problem. I have the APK file on my VZW Galaxy Tab, but it won’t install. I have tried using root explorers, Astro, Es, Titan, Room Toolbox and others. Acts like it is installing, but comes back with “Did Not Install”. </p>
<p> Hi friends, Failed to install the new version of Android Market even by downloading the ‘Android Market v3.1.6.apk’ directly to the phone or to the PC as mentioned here and copied to phone. The phone tries to install it and gives the response:’Application not installed’. What could be the problem? Any solution? Thanks to all. </p>
<p> Hi Neal, Cleared cache and data, still unable to install the new version of the Market. Thanks </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Use Android Mobile as Webcam for PC – Wi-Fi & USB Mode – Download App Apk </p>
<p> If you are using the Android based mobile phone then you have chosen the right mobile software platform. Android powered by Google is amazing operating system for mobiles which is an open source and best thing comes with the complete rights to install any Android App on your mobile. Recently browsing through the Android App Marketplace, I can across IP Webcam app, I read the description and thought of having a try with it, the next it happened to be surprise to me as it can make your mobile phone work as webcam for PC supporting Wi-Fi and USB mode. </p>
<p> IP Webcam for Android </p>
<p> IP Webcam is an Android App which can do wonders for you. It turns your phone into a wireless camera with multiple viewing options. The camera can be viewed in VLC Media player or any web browser on any platform. It’s a personal suggestion that you go with Google Chrome rather than with Internet Explorer. </p>
<p> Now without the need of your front facing camera you can use your primary camera located on the rear side with Skype, Chatroulette and other video chat software’s for video streaming but its limited for Windows only. But usage for the large time will dry up your battery within no time and Android mobile phone consumes more battery makes it more limited. </p>
<p> IP Webcam supports Windows, Mac and Linux. It works like a charm on most of the mobile phone and it gets 4 star rating in official Android Marketplace. The IP Webcam is ideal for short time use like keep an eye on your pets when you are in another room. </p>
<p> Regardless of platform, you can open the video streaming on any PC or laptop by opening the address provided when you install this app provided you connect only within the same network. </p>
<p> Did you know that you can even also expose this webcam on internet. For doing that you need to know the external IP and read your router’s documentation on port forwarding. This would enable to view video streaming from any PC anywhere. </p>
<p> IP Webcam Download </p>
<p> As you know it’s easy to install apps on your Android mobile phone. Go to your mobile phone and tap Market. Download the App APK here – IP webcam and click on install, it would be ready for use. </p>

<p> Please help. I am not tech savy at all. I see many of you are though. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3, I have downloaded the IP Webcam that everyone is raving about. I am at a friend’s house and I am not part of their network. I understand I have to be part of their network to make my webcam work, correct? Can I be a part of their network without them knowing if I acquire the correct information from their computer. I want to use my phone as a webcam to monitor what happens in the driveway without them knowing, I don’t want to alarm them. Can I accomplish any or all of these? If you respond and I would appreciate that, please do it as a teacher and go slow. I appreciate any helpful responses. Just to inform you when I try to connect, and I am using their Wi-Fi, which I use on my laptop, so I do know the password to log into their Wi-Fi, I get the message: If you want to expose your phone to the internet, and your router has an external IP, read your router’s documentation on port forwarding. I don’t think I want to expose my phone to the internet, do I? Other than that, I really don’t have an idea what they are saying. Thanks again for your time, Mike </p>

<p> Android Optical Character Recognition App for Image to Text Conversion </p>
<p> Whatever Google does turns into gold. Their step into mobile operating system became successful and it’s not ruling the market. Google constantly comes out with helpful things which makes the life easy. Google Goggles is one of those Google development which makes many things easy for work on your mobile. </p>
<p> Google Goggles Android App </p>
<p> With Google Goggles you can search the world with images. It’s a specially designed application by Google. This apps performs the task of searches based on pictures taken by your mobile phone, tablets and other handheld devices. Now you can take the picture of the landmark and know what its name and the complete history of it. </p>
<p> Google Goggle is designed for perfect work on the Google’s Android operating system for mobile devices and other platforms such as iOS for iPhone and BlackBerry OS for BlackBerry phones. So as such Google Goggles will work for Android mobile phones too. </p>
<p> Google Goggles for Android can virtually identify most of the things like label, landmarks, text, visiting cards, books and lot more. So with this app on your mobile phone no need to worry of the languages that you don’t understand, but importantly you should have the text written and you can project your phone camera after opening the Google Goggles on your mobile phone to translate the text into the language that you understand. So this app also can be used as the real time languages translation tool on your mobile phone. </p>
<p> With this apps, just by scanning the books covers you can discover, buy and find information of it without typing anything on your mobile phone. Also by just scanning the visiting card using this apps you can easily save the contact information. </p>
<p> By just scanning the logo you can know about the company, scanning the painting find the owner, find information on wine too. I think this is must have apps on your mobile phone. It can also help you in solving the Su Do Ku puzzle. </p>
<p> Google Goggles as App for Image to Text Conversion </p>
<p> You might have heard of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Interestingly there aren’t a lot of OCR apps available for Android. The Google Goggles is the best program of those apps. </p>
<p> You can use Google Goggles as the OCR recognition tool to convert the image text into copyable text. Now the copied text can be put anywhere in your phone, it can be used for editing, direct message, Gmail or anything other which you could imagine. The language translation also would allow you to copy the text and make it useful. </p>
<p> Google Goggles Download </p>
<p> Google Goggles app for Android mobile phone can be downloaded from the Android Apps Labs. This app is available for free download to be used on the various devices but make sure that this is compatible on your mobile phone. </p>
<p> Sudoku solver is great. Unfortunately, it solves the entire puzzle. In practice most people would want a solution only for the next move. </p>
<p> I am myself using this app and it is an excellent app, works very well as business card reader too. </p>
<p> I’ve been using optical character recognition software for a couple of months, I have Smart OCR. I am quite pleased with it, almost no errors for me even for low-quality documents. http://smartocr.com </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> List of Android Phones with 4K Video Recording Cameras </p>
<p> 4K resolution is the next gen resolution where you get to see the high definition content on screens having a horizontal width in the order of 4000 pixels. When we talk of picture capturing, it is quite possible for the smartphone cameras to do a decent capturing with the current cameras provided. But for the video recording, the best resolution for capturing videos is the Full HD 1080p resolution, and there are just a very limited number of smartphones which are capable to take advantage of the lens, sensor and the processor to produce videos with a resolution higher than the 1080p one. </p>
<p> For now, we have three smartphones from the well known brands which can capture the videos in 4K resolution. </p>
<p> Acer Liquid S2 was the first Android smartphone announced with the 4K video recording and it was announced at the IFA 2013 event in Berlin, with a 6-inch 1080p display, Snapdragon 800 processor and everything else pretty good. It’s the 13-megapixel rear camera which does the 4K video recording and that was quite a surprise because the rumors and leaks never showed the video recording details, and this brought about the spark to include the camera modules and processors which could make the videos with the 4K resolution. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is capable of capturing videos with the 4K resolution, and it produces the videos with the 3840 x 2160 pixels resolution. This although wasn’t the first smartphone camera to provide this feature, the 4K capturing looks pretty impressive and it is only on the US LTE variant of the Note 3 and not the International one, processor being the reason for that. </p>
<p> The successor to the LG Optimus G Pro, the G Pro 2 was announced a day back in Korea, and this too has got the same feature that we are discussing here. The capturing is done with the 13-megapixel rear camera which comes with the OIS+ feature for more stability to both the photo and video captures. The camera is also capable of recording slow motion videos at 120 fps, and there’s a lot more which can be done with the special camera app in the device. </p>
<p> The new and latest entrant to the list is the Sony Xperia Z2, the smartphone having the 20.7-megapixel Exmor RS camera, and having the capability of UHD 4k video recording to the already excellent camera features that the smartphone provides. </p>
<p> Another device with the 4K video recording is the Samsung Galaxy S5, which has the 16-megapixel camera with loads of features, and the Samsung cameras do quite a lot so the 4K video capturing is an excellent addition to the camera features. </p>
<p> The Vivo Xshot is one of the latest addition to the list, with the announcement in China, showcasing some excellent specifications and the 13MP rear camera with Sony’s lens having the OIS and the 4K video recording. </p>
<p> The OnePlus One has come in as one of the best Android smartphones having a price which no high-end device has. The phone is priced at $299, and it comes with a 13-megapixel Sony lens camera which is capable of recording 4K videos. </p>
<p> Oppo Find 7 – This one from Oppo came in as the latest flagship, having some excellent specs, but Oppo has given 4K recording to this, while a 1080p video recording on the variant of it – Find 7a. </p>
<p> Although the smartphones / phablets listed above are capable of the capturing, it’s interesting that Sony hasn’t made any developments in this category, although they had launched the Sony Xperia Z1 with the 20.1-megapixel G Lens camera (which was actually rumored to have the 4K video recording but there was nothing like that in reality) and that camera could do a lot with the Camera app, having special features, effects and modes, but the video recording is limited to 1080p. The Xperia Z2 is going to come soon, so we can expect that to have some enhanced features. </p>
<p> We are sure that the year 2014 will have some excellent smartphones with the cameras doing much more than what they have been doing, and the 4K video recording being a good inclusion in the list of features. </p>

<p> Android Q&A : Best Budget Android Smart Phone to Buy – Moto G or any other? </p>
<p> Question : Hello Android Advices Team, I have been following your blog and want to gift my wife a new Smart Phone which should not be too big in terms of the form factor and should have decent hardware along with battery backup and the pricing is also important because we tend to change devices every year hence we don’t want to spend a lot of money on the handset. Answer : Every month we see many different smart phones launched and we recommend quite a few depending on the budget and the features but recently Motorola launched the Moto G Smart Phone and its one of the finest smart phones we have tested. </p>
<p> Available at a price of just $199 which is the Global GSM Unlocked Model, the device is a master piece for the display, hardware and the price. Along with this a very important point to note is that its not a handset which is made in China because Motorola has started assembling all their devices in the US itself. </p>
<p> Competition : In the Budget Smart Phone category there are certainly many different options like the Sony Xperia M, Xperia L, Galaxy Core, Galaxy Grand, LG Optimus L9 2, Gionee Elife E6 etc all of which have some good and some bad around the same which you could read on the individual blog posts on this blog. </p>
<p> Cutting Edge Features : The reason we recommend the Moto G is that it comes with a very good display on the 4.5” screen along with a 326 PPI Pixel density. The device does not come with a 8Mp camera which most of the budget devices come up with these days but comes with a decent 5Mp camera which captures photos at 2592×1944 pixels and which does record videos at 720P. Check out the Moto G Camera Samples. </p>
<p> Spill Proof is another important point which not many users have idea about which comes packed in this device. If you want a smart phone which can withstand a little water then this device is for you because it comes with something like Nano Coating ensuring that the device won’t get damaged in case you drop some water on it by mistake. At this price point there is almost no handset from Tier 1 manufacturer offering this feature. </p>
<p> Regarding the OS which is something very important to many users, the device comes with Android 4.3 and the first time you boot it up, you get the Android 4.4.2 OTA Update which is very interesting. The back side of this device is made of plastic but gives you a feel of rubber which ensures that you won’t drop the device easily. We have made a detailed review on a 10 Factor list as you want watch in the video below. </p>
<p> Cons / Negative Factors : Personally we didn’t like the back cover of this device because it attracts a lot of finger snudges and makes the phone look bad within a few minutes of usage. The device does not stand out in terms of looks unlike the Moto X which gives you a premium look. Even though the device comes with a powerful processor, the 1Gb RAM does make you feel that the device becomes laggy if you install many large applications and if they are running in the background. </p>
<p> Overall if you are convinced with the Motorola Moto G, you should have a look at the links given below and buy one right away. </p>

<p> 6 Specifications to Look for while Buying Android Smartphone / Tablet </p>
<p> With year coming to an End and if by any chance you wanted to k now on what are the mantras for buying the best smartphones, then we will guide you so that you can buy the best possible smartphone at an affordable price. We will tell you on which core specs you should focus on before finalizing to buy any smartphone / tablet. Many times we have been asked about on which phone is better, though it’s difficult to keep on a track on the phone launches as almost every day one or other smartphone is launched. There’s no Greek or Latin in this Smartphone buying guide, everything is explained in simplest possible language. So, let’s proceed to the Smartphone tablet buying guide. Though we will be covering all the latest from the World of Android. </p>
<p> While the Android apps are constantly putting pressure on Apple, it’s now time that Android to look for quality devices and quality apps as there are many reports of Malware apps being doing the rounds in the Google PLAY Store. So, let’s check out the Top 7 parameters which you need to look for before you purchase the Android smartphone. </p>
<p> RAM (Minimum of 512MB, higher the better): One such parameter which you will have to look for if you wish to have a device which doesn’t hang is RAM. A minimum of 1GB RAM is required if at all you want the best performance out of your smartphone, just in case if your budget is low then you can go with some smart phones which are optimized 512MB of RAM. These days some smartphones have even come up with 2GB of RAM, which are LG Nexus 4 and also there are some select Galaxy S3 variants which have 2GB of RAM. </p>
<p> Processor (Minimum is 1GHz, higher the better): After RAM, the second thing which you need to look for is Processor which is in fact the heart of the smartphone. Now, the current trend is the Quad Core processors but it’s good enough to buy a smartphone which comes with a decent Single Core 1GHz processor, though higher the processing speech, better will be the performance of the smartphone. Also, you will have to ensure that the GPU presence will further enhance the performance of the graphics as it will render games in a better manner. </p>
<p> Warranty (Minimum of 1 year, go with extended warranty): Beware of devices which are having No Warranty or Limited Warranty, go with the devices which have a minimum of 1 year Warranty, also if you are getting the Extended Warranty option then you MUST go with the same as in Android while updating / customizing with the new updates the motherboard of the device might get hampered which is covered in the Warranty. With extended warranty, you can actually have peace of mind, also ensure that the extended warranty is given by the manufacturer and not the reseller. </p>
<p> Android Version (Minimum of ICS Android 4.0 version, higher the better): The latest Android version till date is Jellybean 4.2.1 version, though its only available for select devices as of now, you will have to look for the devices which are on the ICS Android 4.0 firmware version. Though there are many custom ROMs available, it’s always better if manufacturer comes out with the ICS Android 4.0 firmware version. </p>
<p> Hands ON Experience (Experience device before buying): Before proceeding to buy, you will have to make sure that you haveensure that you have had a hands on experience with the device which you have shortlisted to buy as at the end of the day it’s your hard earned money. With hands on experience, you can actually check on the screen brightness, colour experience, user interface and also you can check on the build quality as it should not be more platicky. </p>
<p> Camera (Minimum of 5MP, select devices with Front Camera if you do Video Calling): Device should have a minimum of 5MP camera and also ensure that when you take a hands- on experience it has all the advanced features like Panorama Mode, Flash etc. as you may require the same in future. If you are into Video calling, you can probably go with the devices which has front camera, preferably go with devices which have better camera quality greater than VGA. </p>
<p> Do let us know in the comments section just in case if you have any further queries in the comments section below as we will be more than happy to reply all your queries. In the coming days we will also be coming out with the top devices of 2012 which you may consider for buying. </p>

<p> I always look for resolution and ppi density against the screen size..and battery power according to that.. </p>
<p> While purchasing the smartphone internal memory should also be considered. Because lower memory become constraint whenever you want to install new softwares or update the softwares installed on phone. </p>
<p> IF you want a budget phone simply go for the micromax superfone canvas hd, for midrange go with lg optimus L9, for the premium category leave everything simply buy the htc butterfly. </p>
<p> I have a Galaxy S3. Been using Galaxy models for the last 2 years. My experience agrees with most of the comments above except for the OS and Battery Android 2.3.6 was the best ever OS I experienced. The later ones are more beautiful but bulky and therefore gets slow on speed. You need to save your settings etc etc and do a factory reset to tide over the hanging issues. This was never there with GB 2.3.6 About the battery I am in favour of possessing an additional battery because usually the battery do not last even for a single day. This tempts you and me to get it fully charged before leaving home even for a few hours. If you can let the battery get exhausted it will last longer. Do not charge in between. Better have a second battery fully charged with you while moving out for moderatlye longer periods of time. You can be pretty confident for the second or for even for a third day. Revently I purchased 2 nos of extended batteries of 4800mah with their back covers(from eBay). I can use them for more than 2 days, and exhaust them completely before loading the secaond spare battery. So it is high time for Samasung or for any other manufacturers of Android phones to offer a second battery along with an external charger </p>

<p> Tablet – Why? </p>
<p> Tablets PCs are clearly neither the full replacement of personal computer nor it’s in competition with smartphones. Android powered tablets are basically the lightweight version of laptops that you use and they include fewer features than the full fledged personal computer. So the final question before you is if you are planning to executed high end tasks like text input, software run then tablets is not for you as this doesn’t include hardware keyboard and can be mostly used for entertainment purpose, browsing the web, checking email on the go, play and share media. If you want the tablet then read on the following other tips below. </p>
<p> Decide Price </p>
<p> When you are out in the market, the price that you want to put for the tablet is a prime deciding factor. Since there are tablets for every class that you spent, you get tablets available for $ 99 and at the higher price of $ 1500 too. The price is completely dependent upon the featured which are added to the tablet and most as we see, the tablets with waterproof and break proof are priced more than $ 1000. So its depends on the composition of hardware, software and the feature included in the tablet which judges its price. </p>
<p> Web Connectivity Option </p>
<p> Before buying a tablet you should know that what are the web connectivity options available to you or you would prefer to go with when buying an Android tablet as most of the Android tablets are with possible options of 3G or 4G and Wi Fi or both. It clear that every manufacturer has priced 3G version of their tablet a little higher than the Wi-Fi version. A Wi Fi enabled tablet will provide internet connectivity to the tablet via Wi Fi but if you have no source by which you can create Wi Fi then buying just Wi Fi tablet is bad compromise and while choosing an Android tablet powered with 3G and 4G capabilities you should be aware of the 3G or 4G plans and its monthly cost to you as if you buy a 3G tablet and you feel plans are costly then your tablet is just an entertainment device. If you want to make choice of 3 G and Wi Fi then a tablet which has both connectivity options would be a right choice but that will cost you more than the 3G or the Wi-Fi version of the same tablet. </p>
<p> Form Factor (Tablet Size) Choice </p>
<p> Form Factor is the deciding factor you should make a choice with as the tablet are available in different form factor of 7 inches, 8 inches, 9.1 inches and 10.1 inches display. When you think of the screen size in tablets, its in accordance with same technology used for mobiles, TVs i.e., the screen size is measured diagonally and its not the size of the tablet. It should be pre determined by the users whether they feel comfortable with 7 inches tablet or 10.1 inches would be better for them for better viewing and experience. The 7 inches and 10.1 inches variants are most sold in the market than the 8 inches and 9 inches comparatively. </p>
<p> With price not only dependent on the screen size, its the composition of it like screen configuration, pixel density, resolution, density, type of screen used comes into the picture of judging the best tablet in the market. </p>
<p> Powerful Processor </p>
<p> If you are going for an Android tablet then processor is the essential specifications that you should look at and be aware what is currently been trending in the market and which is out dated. This knowledge should be required because constantly tablet manufacturers are striving to provider a better processor speed which can compete with the competitors and stay in the market. </p>
<p> If you want to buy a tablet at present then you should be choosing a tablet which has 1 Ghz processor and anything less than that would results in slower performance of your tablet and would be a bad compromise. Most of the high end tablets now come with minimum of 1.2 Ghz dual core processor. </p>
<p> Camera </p>
<p> Most of the high end tablets come with camera with better quality and resolution. Camera in Android tablet is a subjective choice and depending upon your needs you should make a choice. If you want to use tablet as entertainment and communication purpose then having a camera on the front or at the rear side is quite important, however if you want a tablet just for the business use then you can overlook the feature of better camera in your tablet. </p>
<p> Android Version </p>
<p> When you are out to buy an Android tablet, you should first have a brief knowledge of the Android OS terminology adopted by Google. Google has named their Android version different codename based on the dessert items which are released in Alphabetical order. So lets quickly go through the Android version history. </p>
<p> Oflate choosing an Android tablets for your choice and getting it within your price range is also dependent on the Android version it incorporated with. For example the latest buzz of Ice Cream Sandwich operating system powered tablets is in much demand as they are with the latest Android version which is currently trending in the market. The Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich powered tablets are demand and their prices are high. Few months ago Honeycomb Android 3.x powered tablets used to be the favorites one and now they are considered to be out dated one, though they can be upgraded to Android 4.0 if the hardware is capable to run the ICS perfectly. It’s now not recommended to go with any tablet which is powered with Android Gingerbread 2.x version as that tablet will be of very little use for you moreover at that price range you can buy better alternative of it. Having the latest version of Android will ensure that you can use application which are designed only for latest Android versions. </p>
<p> So while choosing an Android tablet you should check out the Android version included in the tablet. You can easily check the Android version printed on the box at specifications and features.You can also check out at the official site of manufacturer. </p>
<p> Multi Touch Support </p>
<p> If you are in need to latest tablet which can survive for the future technology trends, then you should go with multi touch input supported tablets. There exists tablets with single touch input but most of the tablets now are with multi touch operation. Along with that it comes with other operation of scrolling, shifting from one apps to another, one screen to another, pinch to zoom and automatic rotation of screen. </p>
<p> The single touch are now been phased out completely, but as of now users needs to look for multi touch input support mentioned under specifications before you purchase. </p>
<p> Storage Capacity </p>
<p> Android tablets come with various storage capacities with variations in internal storage and external storage capacities. While with a micro SD or SDHC card slot its clear that we can pump in additional memory up to 32 GB or 64 GB depending on the supportability but storage capacity limits should be checked out before purchasing a tablet because most of the tablets don’t include microSD card slot instead they provide with inbuilt internal storage capacity. </p>
<p> Right now the top configuration is the 64 GB flash memory storage and we have spotted many tablets with 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB variants. The prices are varied accordingly depending on the internal storage capacity. </p>
<p> Application Market Access </p>
<p> Though Android Market is the official one by Google, there exists so many competitors to Android Market too. Surprisingly, since the Android operating system is an open source, few manufacturers have designed it to restrict the users by providing access to their own custom Marketplace for apps rather than the official one. Its surprising to see manufacturers promoting their own customized market but we hear no obligations from Google Android team. </p>
<p> The Android Market has surpassed Apple iPad apps and its well curated with deep selection of applications. Its the matter of security and staying away from malware and antivirus which comes into play. </p>
<p> Choose the tablet Currently Trending </p>
<p> Android tablet is not just buy once you are done, even for manufacturers. The manufacturers should provide the timely updates to tablet so as to fix bugs from the previous software version if any are present and further more it has become a tradition for the Android platform to receive the timely updates. Manufacturers like Samsung, Acer, Asus and Motorola are always keep provide timely update to their existing tablet. </p>
<p> Buying a tablet which doesn’t come out with updates will quickly make your tablet with outdated version of Android. So in our advice, buying a tablet which is more commonly used by the users will keep manufacturer engaging to care for the customers and so provide timely updates or fixes. </p>
<p> Finally if you are very much eager to understand all these it’s better to visit a local electronics store nearby your location and gets hands-on with those different tablets to decide which works better for you. By following the above guide and buying tips I think you would be now able to judge which tablet suits your needs and when to buy it. </p>

<p> Android Wear – Wearable Gadgets like Smart Watches running on Android OS Coming Soon </p>
<p> Small, powerful devices, worn on the body. Useful information when you need it most. Intelligent answers to spoken questions. Tools to help reach fitness goals. Your key to a multiscreen world. – there they said it. Google has just released the Developer Preview of the Android Wear for the developers. </p>
<p> So this is the right time for Google to enter into the wearable category, as they announce Android Wear, a special separate version of Android OS, which would work only for the wearable devices – the smartwatches. Showing a couple of videos, Google already did quite a lot of explanation about what is to come, and what are the possibilities if the Android Wear is used as a the OS for a smartwatch. Google showed the LG G Watch as an example for showcasing the new OS, and the watch looks brilliant already, and LG is one of the early partners along with Motorola, to make a wearable device with the Android Wear OS. </p>
<p> The developer preview for the developers is out, and here’s what you as a developer can do with it right now. </p>
<p> Run the Android Wear platform in the Android emulator. </p>
<p> Connect your Android device to the emulator and view notifications from the device as cards on Android Wear. </p>

<p> Once you signup as a developer, here is what you get access to: </p>
<p> New notification APIs in the preview support library </p>
<p> Sample apps using the new notification APIs </p>
<p> The Android Wear Preview app for your mobile device, which connects your device to the Android Wear emulator </p>
<p> With the Android Wear and the excellent apps that would be made available, a user would be able to get: </p>
<p> Useful information when needed: The information we are talking about, is the updates from social networks, latest posts, chats from the famous messaging apps, notifications from the apps – which include the categories such as shopping, news, photography etc. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Android Web Browsing Tips </p>
<p> Depending on the browser you have installed on your Android enabled phone you are going to be wondering how to do a few fairly generic tasks. Many people wonder how to do things like saving images while surfing the web, or completing forms and even saving files. The most important thing to keep in mind however; is that you should make use of your Android device to surf the internet. Most mobile plans come with some form of data limit inclusive in the plans cost. If you are not utilizing this you are doing yourself a grave disservice. Get your monies worth and because the Android operating system eats up web tasks – you might find yourself sitting in front of the television at night using your phone rather than a net book or tablet device. </p>
<p> Saving images from the internet is a snap with most of the browsers available for the Android platform. Most Android phones have a media gallery application and they search all storage media on the phone for relevant file extensions so you need not concern yourself overly with where the image is saved. To actually save an image you find on the internet just press the image for a few seconds until a menu pops up. You are likely to be presented with a range of options, just look for the save image option, hit it and your done. Now you can use the aforementioned app to find the image and use it for whatever (like using it as a desktop image). </p>
<p> You are not limited with just viewing images however. You can browse flash based movies and use websites that allow you to save videos to download them to your phone. I won’t give out the specific sites; just do a Google search on ‘save YouTube videos’ and you will be given a list of sites which allow you to do it. In fact there are apps out there that allow you to save the file but I won’t list them here. Because copy and paste commands are built into the Android operating system core you can copy the link to the video, paste it into the site and get presented with a link to download the video – therefore saving your data allowance for more pressing things, such as checking your email or chatting. </p>
<p> Because Android has Flash 10.1 support you can also use your phone to play Flash games. This is a massive bonus over the iPhone – where you actually have to pay to download new games. Now you just need to go forth to a Flash gaming website and you can play a multitude of games for nothing (besides the cost of the download). Not all browsers handle Flash well so play around with a few browsers to find the best one for gaming. Nobody said you can’t install more than one browser on your phone either. Because there are so many options out there you are encouraged to play around and find the best browser for your needs. </p>

<p> Apple iPad or the Samsung Galaxy Tab is something you wish to buy, but could not buy because of the high sales prices? Then there is no need to worry because here comes a very cheap alternative called as the AndyPad which can be one of the best budget android tablet. We just covered the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer which is selling like hot cakes because of the $399 price tag along with awesome features but it can also get a serious competitor because of the 50% lower price of this tablet. </p>
<p> The tablet would be offered in 7″ screen size which is the same size with which the Archos 80 G9 was launched today. The AndyPad comes with the latest firmware update ie the Android 2.3 Gingerbread along with 3D GPU for higher performance. The external ports include a HDMI out, a USB port, a 3.5mm audio jack and a micro SD card slot. </p>
<p> The current listed price on their website is £129 or approx $200 which is pretty low when compared with the specs which are listed above. It’s almost like buying a few books converted into electronic media. With the power of android you can enjoy all those awesome games, useful applications and browsing the web on the go. </p>
<p> Along with this, the tablet would be coming pre-installed with few very useful and regularly used apps like Twitter, Facebook, Drag Racing, Bubble Blast, Tank Hero etc. Stay tuned for another two months and we will keep you update on the AndyPad news and their launch information soon </p>

<p> Andy Rubin – The Former Co-founder of Android to leave Google – Details </p>
<p> Today, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Android co-founder Andy Rubin is now leaving Google. Rubin most recently headed the robotics division within the company. Last year Andy Rubin, Android’s co-founder, stepped down from his position as the leader of mobile OS and handed the reigns over to the Sundar Pichai. The timing of his departure comes just one week before Google celebrates seven years of Android and the first SDK. </p>
<p> According to Google, Andy’s new goal is to start an incubator for start-ups interested in building technology-hardware products. It’s not clear whether Google will be involved in any way with this new incubator, either financially or operationally. </p>
<p> Rubin cofounded Android in 2003 with Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White, and Google acquired the company two years later. Google acquired Android in 2005, and Mr. Rubin helped build it into the world’s most-popular mobile operating system. Last year, Mr. Rubin left Android and began an ambitious acquisition spree that included at least eight companies, with the intent of building a robotics business inside Google. The division is focused on a diverse set of areas surrounding manufacturing and logistics. James Kuffner, who works in Google’s robotics group, will take over Rubin’s position at the top. </p>
<p> Last week, it was reported that Google was reorganizing its leadership, with Larry Page stepping back a bit and handing over the reins of core Google Products to senior vice president Sundar Pichai. Pichai is already heading Android, Chrome, and Apps at Google. </p>
<p> Rubin’s background originally was in the hardware. Before Google, Rubin worked at Apple, and then co-founded the device maker Danger, but he left a half decade before it was acquired by Microsoft. He then went on to co-found Android with Rich Miner in 2003. </p>
<p> Google launched the first phone running Android in 2008. Since then, Android has taken a dominating market share over other smartphone operating systems across the world. Some of the most popular new smartphone manufacturers run modified versions of Android. </p>
<p> Google, too, has launched its line of Google-branded Android phones and tablets under the company’s Nexus project. Google selects specific manufacturers to develop the phones, which don’t include the customized versions of the operating systems. </p>

<p> Announcing PhoneRadar – The Ultimate Resource for Phone Enthusiasts </p>
<p> Today, September 1st 2014, is when we begin a new journey. The team remains the same, but the focus is now on the global phone arena from the Android smartphone segment where we had been actively providing news, tips, reviews to the large reader base for years. PhoneRadar is official, and we are pleased to announce the launch of this brand new website, which is a result of a lot of hard work done by the team. </p>
<p> PhoneRadar gives information about the latest phones, news, reviews, event coverage, comparison and a lot more in a user-friendly look. At PhoneRadar, you will even be able to check the technical specifications of a mobile phone, along with comparative analysis, price of the phone from different commonly used online stores, and a price graph which shows the trends of pricing of the particular phone from the past months. </p>
<p> How did PhoneRadar emerge? </p>
<p> It was since long that the idea was mind, but the implementation was this year, especially because I was very much into other big projects, major AndroidAdvices.com where there was active focus but does the mobile phone industry wholly run on Android OS? the answer was clear and from there, the other major question was not “How we report and review phones” but “WHY we report and review phones”. Frankly, we do all the necessary stuff required to understand how good or bad a product is, before coming out with a verdict which our followers take and make a decision on their purchases. This is where the thought about PhoneRadar came up, and we built a team of hardworking guys who have been actively working already in the same niche since quite long. </p>
<p> Ideas keep coming in mind every second, and we let most of them go for a reason. There are rare instances when we capture them, work on them and come up with something that changes the way you were doing business. It wasn’t just business for me always, and thus, implementation of the idea became not really challenging, but it wasn’t easy as well. It took months of time, a complete team working day and night to bring things together and coming up with this new “product which talks products”. </p>
<p> Decision making isn’t easy even for us, when we are out in the market to purchase a product. There are several players from the industry, bringing out the best of their ideas and making products, but what makes us select one is filtering out the needs. That is what we have focused on, in this website where users can filter the mobile phones / smartphones based on their need and compare the best from the lot. </p>
<p> What’s special at PhoneRadar? </p>
<p> There are three main areas of focus, if we talk about the special features in PhoneRadar. 1. Phone Ratings, 2. Phone Finder and 3. Phone Compare. Check out our page dedicated to explain what are PhoneRadar Phone Ratings, and what we offer to the readers who come with every type of mobile phone query. </p>
<p> We focused a lot on the design of sections such as reviews (check examples here and here), where you get to see full page content with every aspect detailed, giving frank opinion about the device. The product database of ours has thousands of mobile phones from most of the brands recognized around the world, and we are working continuously to expand the database with every phone that is out there. </p>
<p> We are excited to have a team of individuals (check out our team) who are dedicated enough to keep up with the pace in the world of technology and mobile phones, reporting phone news 24×7 and reviewing them, managing the product database and working on the Youtube Channel (check here) where we have garnered over 25 million views and have over 38,000 subscribers. </p>
<p> www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_qIKeuO1Lo </p>
<p> For the future, there are even bigger plans in mind. PhoneRadar would be having an even bigger team, and the main goal would be to still keep the website user-friendly, easy to navigate and awesome as our readers on the network have always been. </p>
<p> Be a part of the community! </p>
<p> There is no better time than now. You can join us, indulge into discussions, join contests (yes, there are a lot of them coming up starting from today), share what you love and send your feedback right away. We learn together, isn’t it? Once again, welcome to PhoneRadar! </p>

<p> YeahRight. </p>
<p> June 13, 2013 at 5:09 am </p>
<p> Check the permissions required by this app and you’ll think twice about installing it. Full accounts access? For a sound generator? Not in this life. </p>
<p> Isn’t using the app on smartphone more poer consuming than one of those mosquito repellent devices. </p>

<p> In the world of casual stock trading, it can be difficult to find your own little middle ground. Every risk you take may be rewarded in a big way, or may drop you into worse straits. Of course, that doesn’t mean there isn’t a field of investment waiting for you. Binary Options are often very lucrative if you use your time well enough. They can become a place of consistent additional income and at the same time, they can also be safer than the rest of the investment field. Luckily, if you’re an Android user, there is an app available to you that will help you get along your way, so here’s anyoption and all that it can offer you. </p>

<p> Yes, it will restore your messages as originally sent/received (date, time, from & to etc), works extremely fine. I have personally tried it (on thread view) and results are superb. </p>
<p> Salam … I did not try this app yet .. but I just wanna thank you for your efforts .. and there is one thing i wanna ask you about to help me in .. I tried to root my SG2 (GT-I9100G) and when I connect with USB my phone cannot be recognized by the computer because of the driver which I couldn’t find in the net .. I found an article that said I should install the PCsuit, and I did but that couldn’t solve the problem. any help? thanks for your efforts again 🙂 </p>
<p> This app works well with my Samsung Galaxy Fit SG5670. Backup, restore, send to email functions work well. Compatibility with phone is always a matter for users to check before installing any apps or widgets. </p>
<p> Dear Neal, As you said if we backed up SMS and later when we update or root the device, will the app itself not be deleted from the device? In this case how can we restore it? </p>
<p> Backups are created in XML Format on the SD Card. Once you update or root your phone, app will be deleted from the device but once the update is done, reinstall the application and import the message XML file. </p>

<p> I’ve had experience with a lot of the apps out there to watch TV, none of them ever gave to me the full TV Everywhere experience. Before I got my own iPad, I borrowed my cousins while I was at him house and connected it to his DirecTV app, I couldn’t leave the home network and really could only us it as a remote. Once I got my own iPad2, I connected it to my DISH Remote Access app which is a free download, I love this thing. I can stream any and all of my channels, as well as have complete access to the DVR. What’s best about this, and something I know since I work for DISH that other providers can’t do, is that I can do all of this as well as schedule recordings from anywhere in the world. I’m not tied down to the home network. </p>

<p> After downloading the APK file – where on the phone do you copy APK file?? Root directory? </p>
<p> running Rooted Samsung Galaxy S 2.2 Froyo, Followed the instructions yet nothing changed. To be honest it was a little vague on what would be changed exactly, judging from the pictures its the carrier name in the drop down notifications window that is whats being changed from att to the name you want </p>
<p> It’s showing both operator name and new name set. Any particular reason for the same? </p>
<p> Yes. I know. And my phone is rooted. And it does not work. Any bright ideas other than a statement of the obvious and an erroneous assumption? </p>
<p> I was doing some online research yesterday and happened to go through your site http://androidadvices.com/ as well. I was really amazed by the rich and informative contents that your site provides. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Apple iPhone 5C vs Motorola Moto X Specs & Pricing Comparison </p>
<p> Apple announced the iPhone 5C a few hours back, with the different color options, and the 5C here says it’s 5 colors and not anything such as “Cheap” or “China” which was rumored earlier. The phone looks quite good with the specifications pulled mostly from the company’s last year iPhone 5 device but would it be good enough to compete with the Moto X which was announced by Google with some excellent customization options? Let’s check below. </p>
<p> The Moto X came with a message for many – Personalization is better than the specs. And it was quite right for us, with out Moto X review talking about how good the device is, despite the Dual-core processor and the basic specifications, but Apple too didn’t do much of the changes with the screen size because they were never after the large screens, but the internal specs have got a lot better. </p>
<p> iPhone 5C vs Moto X </p>
<p> Design, Display and Form Factor </p>
<p> The design of both the devices is good enough, but the Moto X still looks quite attractive, given that you select and pay the extra money for the wooden casing or something similar to that. Both the devices come in several color options, but by default there are 5 colors with the iPhone 5C and 18 colors in the Moto X. Apple has stuck itself with the standard design that they always have, and just the back panel has got some changes. If you are looking for a thin bezel, and more than 4-inch screen size, the 4.7-inch Moto X is what you should look for. But then, someone who needs a standard screen size and a flat back should check out the iPhone 5C. </p>
<p> Processor, Internal Detailing </p>
<p> The processors are totally different, and you cannot easily compare both of these as they would run a totally different OS, and Apple hasn’t been very clear about the speed as it usually compares it with the previous gen. iPhone. The iPhone 5C is powered by the A6 chip which was in the iPhone 5, while the chipset in the Moto X is from Motorola itself, the X8 clocking at 1.7 GHz speed. </p>
<p> Both of them have got the personal assistance, and we actually liked the Google Now for Moto X a lot for its voice recognition where only the account holders can set their voice, and other voices would be just ignored. But Siri isn’t bad for the Apple users. In a true comparison, there’s nothing much different and there are limitations in both, but the only good thing for the Asian users is that the accent was quite well accepted by the Google Now, while Siri was stubborn in that aspect. </p>
<p> Camera </p>
<p> The 10-megapixel camera of the Moto X looks good with the number, but the iPhone 5C would capture better pictures for sure because it’s the same 8-megapixel camera that was in the iPhone 5, being one of the most popular smartphone cameras. The front camera too in the iPhone 5C has got better with the larger pixels and the backside illumination, while there’s a not-so-bad 2-megapixel camera on the front side of the Moto X. </p>
<p> Both the rear cameras have got the 1080p Full HD video recording, but we are yet to test the quality on both of them. We would soon share the actual samples for you to understand which one has got a better picture and video capturing. </p>
<p> Pricing </p>
<p> The pricing of the unlocked iPhone 5C is set quite (for those who were expecting it to be cheap), but when you compare it with the Moto X unlocked, it is lesser by $50 as the 5C is available for $549 while the Moto X is available for $599 in the U.S. For the customization, of course, you need to pay the extra money. The customized panels for the Moto X comes for $50, while Apple has made a few cases for the iPhone 5C, each available for $29 and these come with some cutouts for showcasing the color of the device. </p>
<p> Most of it is the same when you talk of the usage, customization but the final choice stays on the question whether you are interested to use the new iOS 7 or would want to use the Android OS which is excellently set in the Moto X, with the Active Display which makes it easier to read the notifications. </p>

<p> “..someone who needs a standard screen size and a flat back should check out the iPhone 5C” Who says this is standard? Many would argue that 4.3-4.7 is standard. Just saying. </p>

It makes a point that someone would be eager to play it in full screen, YouTube has that and someone might look to play them in loop so that they can easily listen to the same music video again and again, indirectly they don’t need to hit reply button again. Thanks to Google Play Store and thanks to developers of YouTube Repeat that addiction of watching videos again and again is done pretty automatically without your intervention from time to time when the video ends. </p>

<p> Downloaded and installed on SGSII running ICS but message comes up when attempting to run ” not for this model android” WTF? </p>
<p> I use un-rooted galaxy r to capture screen by pressing and holding down Home key followed quickly by On/Off key. You need a bit of practice to get the timing right. </p>
<p> Yes those tricks are for geeks and this is for the new users to make it easy for them. </p>
<p> Am I missing something? Why would I get this app? Screen capture is a standard feature on my galaxy s2. Holding power button and volume down takes a screen capture (ICS) or those running gingerbread press power button + home button. No additional software needed. Am I right or am I right?. </p>
<p> why would you even need this on SGSII? There’s a built in one by pressing home + power on GGB, or power + vol down on ICS. </p>
<p> Yes thats true but the App Developers have mentioned these devices, hence the same was mentioned in the article. </p>
<p> No need any screen capture software for Samsung’s gadgets. it’s built-in already. But I need to capture/sync my phone screen on my PC/laptop screen without rooting. Any body know? </p>

<p> I recently purchased Samsung Galaxy Ace GT S5830. I wanted to upgrade the firmware to GB. I followed all the steps as per Android Advices. I entered all the parameters in the ODIN Downloader. But after hitting the start button it starts. But nothing happens even after lapse of 30 minutes. I tried restarting the PC and Phone. Even then nothing happens. </p>
<p> When I unzip the download and when I enter the file names from the PC it enters the path. Is it correct. If not how it is to be done. Can anybody give me guidance? I am using a LAPTOP and WiFi for downloading the files. Please help me. </p>
<p> Please ask the question in the respective article from where you have had upgraded your phone. </p>

<p> App to Send Multiples Files as Email Attachment on Android </p>
<p> There is lot of difference between using Gmail on your Android phone and Gmail on your PC or laptop. The default Gmail application on your Android mobile phone allows attaching only pictures whereas the Gmail on your PC allows you to attach any files but still keeps the limit of maximum file size attachment as 25 Mb. But our main aim is to have a Gmail just like what it is capable. </p>
<p> With Attachments [Gmail Attach] a specially designed Android application breaks the restriction on your handset and allows you to share any file with your friends and family members. </p>
<p> Once you install this application, you don’t need to do anything. Visit Gmail on your Android mobile phone and compose a mail. To attach file to a mail, click on Menu and among the options select ‘Attach‘. The following result will come to you (remember that generally without this application pictures folder comes up) – </p>
<p> I just browsed the various files which can be attachment and so I browsed to audio files and try to attach few, I was able to do it. </p>
<p> Using this application I was able to successfully install an mp3 song, an apk file and other file easily without any restrictions. </p>
<p> Attachment [Gmail Attach] Download </p>
<p> Attachment [Gmail Attach] Android application can be downloaded on your Android mobile phone easily by visiting Android Apps Labs on to your mobile phone and tap on ‘install‘ button. This application is free to use. </p>

<p> You can also use ForgetBox (http://goo.gl/19r4e): an app for sending files by e-mail or SMS, without limits of size. </p>
<p> But still there is restrictions on file size. When I tried to attach a video clip with the size of 45mb, it is rejected. </p>
<p> Do you know that you can do the same with Binfer? It has a feature called Web Drop with which you can send files from the android phone’s web browser to any computer that is running Binfer. I use it all the time to send videos of my kid to my folks. </p>

<p> Hi appreciat your help. I have Samsung mini2 that makes a lot of problem and I would like to copy/backup every thing! from this phone in order to restor it on another samsung galaxcy . what program to use most of info/data/contacts stored on the phone, few on the sim thank you in advance </p>
<p> Shen, on the September 15, 2011 at 11:59 am you said,Btw, sorry for my bad english. Do not apologize for trying, you have taken the time and trouble to try and learn something new and for this you feel the need to apologize!! Those that close their minds and sit back and expect others do all the work should apologizes. </p>
<p> hey buddy, @ androidadvices you don’t need to say sorry!! 🙂 We are here to understand your issues and address them in any possible language! 🙂 Do let us know for any Android help! </p>
<p> I seem to find a lot of bad review from the app review panel in the market and some strangely opposite review about how wonderful the app is. Some said that the app backed-up using these MyBackUp app can’t be viewed through the market and had to manually installed again, thus render it useless. Is this true or only apply to several device only?? Btw, sorry for my bad english. </p>
<p> it applies to most of the phones, it will support. which phone you are looking out for trying this? </p>
<p> .. ok, i’v used this trial to backup my apps on external sd before flushing new rom into phone .. now new system is up and running, but clean as virgin and to get all my apps back into it I need this mybackup be installed to run restore, which is obviously not cos the system was flushed .. and, when i try to get it from the market again it says that my phone have it installed .. dead cyrcle .. any way out ? </p>
<p> update: actually it works 🙂 – just messed a bit with my google account in 1st place, when have it sorted was able to install backup app again. </p>
<p> a “free” trial is not free, it’s only a trial. a trial is free in its nature and doesn’t have to be described as such. </p>
<p> it’s a shame that the word “free” is used so dishonestly by all the software developers now. </p>
<p> may i know what issue you are facing exactly so that we can troubleshoot the same? </p>
<p> He has a point. The definition of “free” as in “shareware” is dated at best. Depending on your beliefs, “free” either means “freeware” or “open source”, or both. A limited edition with limited features but no time limit would be freeware, and therefore “free”. A trial is, however, shareware, and therefore decidedly NOT free. </p>
<p> Nero, WinZip, and Photoshop all have time-limited trial versions. Would you call Photoshop “free”? </p>
<p> Any other alternatives for real free software backup? -You should no pay for this app when you got hundreds for free out there. </p>
<p> It is imoral to call “crippledware” FREE … if it is ONLY for 30 days, it is NOT FREE … shame on you ! </p>
<p> I did use My Backup Pro (trial version). It is great but can someone tell me where on the SD card are the backup files kept? I cannot find them </p>
<p> Backing up contacts and data is fine, but MyBackup Pro backing up even the call logs is a great feature. The logs can be useful anytime, and that can get deleted anytime, so backing up would be great. </p>
<p> For SMS Backup, VeryAndroid SMS Backup is a smart andriod sms backup software that can copy and backup sms on Android phone to computer, restore sms backup file to any android phone, and also send messages or chat with a friend on computer directly, exactly the same as that you do on your android phone. </p>
<p> It can help you: – Copy and backup sms from Anroid phone to computer. – Restore sms from CSV to android phone any time. – Send SMS & SMS Chat on computer directly. – Transfer sms to android phone from other phones (iPhone, Windows Mobile, Nokia, Blackberry etc). – View sms messages in threading mode on computer. </p>

<p> With this article i came to know the value of android. Thanks for the above information. Good Article… </p>
<p> Didn’t know that Android got an app for the Indian rail services of govt. Pretty good one. What else than the status of trains and their running is given in the app? </p>
<p> Hi, I liked this app, but I have few suggestion. 1 once search results comes, we have to navigate horizontal scroll for looking the complete results 2. “Titles are missing” while we do vertical scrolling for looking search results. 3. Train Running Status– I am looking for a search option for a given train name(some thing like if you type East coast it should bring up running status of the train which are all the stations it is passed at what time and rest… </p>
<p> If you folks looked at the app “Indian Train status” for I phone which is more looks like realistic </p>
<p> Indian Railways have realised the importance of customer services. </p>
<p> This is a good beginning. </p>
<p> Railways can do a lot more to improve customer services and continue with such services. </p>
<p> Speedy, good stuff, now this is the kind of stuff that makes us come back for more. . </p>

<p> Asus Eee Memo Pad 7-inch Android Tablet to Launch at CES 2012 </p>
<p> As the CES 2012 is approaching very faster, more and more devices are rumoured around. 2012 would be the year of tablets again and we have speculation that Asus would be again coming up with a new variant of Android tablet. The recent one which has bites the dust is the 7 inches Asus Eee Memo Pad geared for the launch at CES next week. This unannounced tablet will come with the offering such as 1.2 Ghz dual core Snapdragon processor which is under its hood. </p>
<p> Asus Eee Memo Pad Tablet </p>
<p> The 7 inches version will follow its recently announced 10 inches Transformer Prime with an additional physical keyboard dock. Though this would be a great addition but it is likely less comfortable. In the past weeks Asus has been in headlines with regards that it will come up with NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad core chip. If that happens to be true then Asus would be the first to get quad core mobile processor and I am sure that Asus would be surely hoping of that. But accordingly to the specifications that have been received of Memo Pad, those rumours still might take time. </p>
<p> The Eee Memo Pad will be spotted with 7 inches capacitive touchscreen display with a maximum resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels. Needless to say that this tablet will be running the Google Android OS and needful to speak it will be with Honeycomb 3.2 version, though one would have expected it with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich but it’s for sure that it will not be with ICS. If it has to come with Ice Cream Sandwich, the news would have been bigger and louder. Coming to Ice Cream Sandwich, the first tablet available is Ainol Novo 7 tablet and we have gone with hands on review of it. It will be powered with Qualcomm 1.2 Ghz dual core Snapdragon processor and expected that tablet will provide internal storage anywhere from 16 GB to 64 Gb and it will be with both Wi-Fi and 3G connectivity options. </p>
<p> Though the photo of Asus Eee Memo Pad is obtained, we are not sure whether it’s of Memo Pad as because all the Asus tablets looks one and the same. We will soon know more about this tablet when its launches and the full specifications of the devices would be available then. </p>

<p> Though they run on the same operating system, there is a slight change in the User Interface. The EEE Pad runs Asus’ Waveshare UI on top of Honeycomb, which adds its own small tweaks and gesture improvements throughout the software while the Thrive runs on Toshiba’s own UI, which actually is more or less similar to stock HoneyComb itself. Not many changes out there on the Thrive, in general. </p>

<p> The Asus EEE Pad Transformer TF101G supports GSM bands on 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 and HSDPA on 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100 on 3G and comes with a standard SIM Card slot, if you are going for the 3G Model.

<p> 9 Comments </p>
<p> I visited a lot of website but I conceive this one has got something extra in it. </p>
<p> There are many things that are untrue in this article. First, Toshiba tends to be very humble with their advertising. The Thrive does indeed have a proximity sensor. It is up by the light sensor which is near the rotation lock, but on the display side. It flashes an infra-red light. Also Toshiba built a 4G model of their Thrive. </p>
<p> I do thank you for the review, but there are a couple of matters that should be cleared up: </p>
<p> 1) I would caution you to consider more serious proofreading in the future 2} Improve your writing style and format. 3} Adding an extra line of space, or small divider between the \Winner\ section and the title of the following category and keeping font consistency in your titles would assist your readers in knowing which section belongs with which. 4} Your opening paragraph was adequate, but your conclusion was weak and a bit ill-formed 5} Last but not least, your review really did not give any serious distinction to one device or the other, other than a yellow tint in Thrive’s photographing and some minor memory differences. Speaking of which, if the Transformer has a 64 GB max and the Thrive has a 32 max, would not the Transformer win? </p>
<p> Frankly, from this review, there really does not seem to be any difference, even price-wise that is of major import. Overall, nice try, but I give you a B- at best. Better luck next time. </p>
<p> I have a few issues with this review. Let’s start. </p>
<p> 1) Form Factor: Yes, the Asus is far thinner. However, that size comes with a price. To get the functionality out of the Asus you get out of the Toshiba, you have to buy the docking station separately. That’s an additional cost of $150 (give or take a few dollars depending on where you get it) and the weight is significantly increased. You basically have a less powerful netbook with the Asus. The only advantage is having the qwerty keyboard with the docking station. However, that additional $150 brings the price up to more than you’ll pay with the Toshiba. </p>
<p> Winner: Toshiba Thrive </p>
<p> 2) Display: It seems that the Asus is actually a smidge ahead of the Toshiba on resolution, not even enough for the human eye to notice. Tie on that part. The proximity sensor is not much of an issue for most people, so its impact is negligible. </p>
<p> Winner: Tie </p>
<p> 3) Toshiba has a more powerful camera on the front. You state that clearly in the article. As for the yellowish hue on the rear camera, did you take the protective plastic covering off of it that came from the factory? </p>
<p> Winner: Toshiba Thrive </p>
<p> 4) I’m taking into account that this article may be a bit dated. With that in mind, the Toshiba can be upgraded to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich as well as the Asus. User interface on both is almost completely identical with no significant variations. </p>
<p> Winner: Tie </p>
<p> 5) Connectivity: No disagreement with article. </p>
<p> Winner: Asus Eeepad Transformer (barely) </p>
<p> 6) Again, taking into account that this article is dated, Toshiba no longer has the 8GB version (according to their website) but also has a 64GB version. Other than that, no disagreement with the article. </p>
<p> Winner: Toshiba Thrive </p>
<p> 7) Only one complaint: The processor chipset between the two isn’t significant enough to give the edge to either side. Neither is the memory chipset. Battery life is still better on the Asus. </p>
<p> Winner: Asus Eeepad Transformer </p>
<p> Conclusion: The individual writing the article was either misinformed about certain features or was biased toward the Asus. The winner here is the Toshiba. I’m not bashing the Asus in any way. I think the writer needs to take a little more time, do a little more research, and be a bit more careful when he compares items. </p>
<p> you do realize that you have to pay for the dock? and when carrying all of this stuff around it’s over 3 pounds! why not spend the same amount of money on a netbook if you plan to lug around a tablet and a full size docking station… kind of defeats the purpose don’t you think? also… you can just get the case with the built in bluetooth keyboard for the thrive, simple and only a fraction of what the docking station costs for the transformer. </p>
<p> “The EEE Pad from Asus is worth the money you would be investing on a tablet, because it comes with a keyboard dock as well.” </p>
<p> Now i am not biased against the asus since i actually own one as i do the thrive…. thrive just makes more sense for somebody that needs an affordable tablet to replace the netbooks…. you get the 3 full size slots that you need and it isn’t necessary to buy a docking station to type on a keyboard… you can just spend 40 bucks on a case that comes with a bluetooth keyboard already built in…. that’s as easy as it gets! </p>
<p> Well the thing about the keyboard that you dont mention is that it extends battery life. The difference between this and a netbook is that when both the tablet and keyboard are charged, it will last you almost a whole day where as, at least to my knowledge, netbooks only last around 10 hours. About the statement you made about “why not just get a netbook” well the thing about this tablet + keyboard combo, is that it isnt always a “netbook” it becomes a netbook when you need it to be, can be a tablet when you want that portability. </p>
<p> I understand that you are not biased against the asus, I just would like to point out a few other things that people may want to know after reading your post. </p>
<p> I Have a Transformer and every test that i’ve read I’m happy that I bought the transformer!! </p>

<p> Asus Padfone – Tablet Phone on Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich </p>
<p> Google during the 2011 Google I/O summit said that it’s engineering the upcoming version of Android named as Ice Cream Sandwich and official release would in Q4 2011. Android 4.0 would be named as “Ice Cream Sandwich” which is a combination of Gingerbread and Honeycomb into a cohesive device on whole would soon become reality. </p>
<p> I was wondering why Asus (ASUSTek Computer Incorporated) has not launched any new phones in the past few months. And here I get the answer for that as they were gearing for the future of mobile phone business and so they have shifted their smartphone strategy. </p>
<p> The hottest news from Asus, which will turn your heads is the new Asus Padfone which would be the first device released with Android much awaited Ice Cream Sandwich OS. It would be released in the end of 2011 or the early 2012. </p>
<p> Launched by Asus, Padfone is a cohesive device consisting of one smartphone and one tablet. Both the device would have their own operating system and their own batteries. When your phone is docked-in, you can dynamically switch between the tablet display and the phone screen. </p>
<p> The tablet would have 10.1 inches screen size and the smartphone with 4.3 inches as the screen size. The users will be able to play videos and see photos on tablet from the 4.3 inches smartphone. When the mobile phone is docked with the tablet, it uses the tablet battery. It has only one cellular connectivity option which is present on the phone with 3G capabilities through a SIM card slot. The tablet can use 3G through mobile phone and get the data connectivity. The mobile phone comes with dual camera one of the front and other on the rear side. The tablet will come with Honeycomb and the mobile phone would run on Android 2.3 Gingerbread. One would be wondering why is the necessity of dock? As far as I can tell you, it’s all about combining and sharing mobile phone and the tablet for cohesive use of 3G dongle, video and photos sharing and other uses. </p>
<p> There is no further announcement from Asus regarding the hardware specifications of the device and the pricing details though we tentatively have release dates. </p>

Later this week, the company is all set to launch its successor Phoenix 3 in the U.S under the AT&T’s GoPhone lineup. The device features entry-level specifications and will be available starting March 10th. It comes with a $80 price tag while the last years Phoenix 2 was launched at $100. The new Phoneix 3 is actually the LG K4 2017 that first unveiled at the CES 2017 held in Las Vegas in early January. It comes with a polycarbonate shell, and the power button is placed on the rear of the device. The textured back panel offers nice grip to hold on to the device. </p>
<p> It sports a 5-inch FWVGA (854 x 480 pixels) in-cell display on the front with on-screen navigation buttons. The device is powered by 32-bit Snapdragon 210 MSM8909 quad-core processor clocked at 1.1GHz along with Adreno 304 GPU which may not handle heavy graphics. There is 1GB/2GB RAM, 16GB internal storage, and an additional MicroSD card slot for storage expansion up to 32GB. In the camera department, the Phoenix 3 has a 5MP autofocus rear camera with LED flash and a 5MP fixed focus camera on the front for selfies and video calls. The Phoenix 3 doesn’t support dual SIM dual standby like the unlocked LG K4 2017. </p>
<p> While the LG K4 2017 came with NFC support, there is no information about its presence on the Phoenix 3. Connectivity options include 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, 3.5mm Audio port, and a MicroUSB 2.0 port. It is backed by a 2,500mAh removable Li-Ion battery that can give around 16 hours of talk time. The device runs on Android 6.0 marshmallow based LG UX UI laid on top. It measures 144.76 x 72.6 x 7.9 mm and weighs 136 grams. As of now, the Phoenix 2 was retailing at $70 and packs much better hardware than the Phoneix 3. It sports a 5-inch HD display and an 8MP rear camera. The processor and front camera remains same, but it includes a smaller 2,125mAh battery. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Automate Tasks With Your Android </p>
<p> The Android software stack has so many nifty features that you can use to automate certain tasks as a true time saver. You can do little things to enhance your Android to super-phone status. Consider being able to have your phone switch itself into silent mode depending on where you are and what you are doing. You may also want your Android to turn off certain functions depending on where you are and how you lay your phone down. There is a neat little app out there that can do all of this and more that goes by the name of the Tasker. Tasker is around $6 (it also has a free 14 day trial) and promises to make your Android into an automated powerhouse of a phone. </p>
<p> A few things that Tasker can do for you are things like allowing you designate specific preferences for every single one of your apps. This might be things like allowing Kindle to remain on for a longer period of time, make your map app automatically fire up the GPS, automate the file browser when you connect it to certain devices and lower the volume of the Android depending on whether or not you have headphones plugged in or are talking to a loud person. </p>
<p> It also allows you to automate tasks depending on the time of the day. This can be useful for those of us who use our phones for business only (or have a phone just for business). You can set your phone to put itself into airplane mode each night at a certain time so that you don’t have any incoming calls or business related contact in the middle of the night – but you can still use your apps. You can also use it to back up the data in your phones memory to your SD card each day and even load up an application each day at a specific time. </p>
<p> You can also use it to set up widgets depending on who is contacting you or where you are. For example, if you are driving and you can’t pick up the call, you can set up a desktop widget that you can use to text back the person to let them know that you were driving at the time of their call and could not answer it. You can also get it to automatically send someone’s call to voice mail so that you can screen your calls. For $6 it adds a lot of extra functionality to your Android and can be used for more than what I have already stipulated. In fact, you are only limited by your imagination in regards to setting up specific tasks depending on certain triggers. </p>
<p> For more information it is worth going through the developer’s information about the product. To cover everything it can do I could probably write a short book on its specific uses. Needless to say, I have it installed on my Android phone and have not actually scratched the surface on what it can do. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Automatically Save any MMS you receive on Android Devices </p>
<p> There are several ways in which you can save picture or attachment which is in your Inbox, one of them is to select the attachment, long press on it and options will appear to save it. This is available in most of the smartphones but what if its not available on your phone. Android Market is the place where you can find a handful of application each dedicated for its own significant work. There are many applications available based on MMS and to download attachment from multi media messages, one particular application called ‘Save MMS’ is the famous and the free one. </p>
<p> Save MMS is an Android application which allows you to automatically save your MMS attachments on to your phone whenever you get them. When you get MMS from the sender, you would like to save it. You can save attachments like pictures, audio and video from your MMS containing text directly on to your SD card. It’s developed by Andrew Schwimmer, who also developed the paid application called ‘AutoSave MMS’. Save MMS is among those limited application available for free download as many other are paid ones. </p>
<p> The Save MMS creates a folder in your SD card to save the attachment that you download in ‘SavedMMS’ folder. Although you can change or create a new folder to add those MMS files. Also you have the option to save those downloaded attachment in order of your preferences either in ascending or descending order. These options are available once you open the application and click on Settings. </p>
<p> Good to have this application on the phone and if you are like me who keeps forgetting, don’t beat yourself and ask the person to resend the MMS as this application will do it for you without much of the work done at your end. </p>
<p> Save MMS Download </p>
<p> The Save MMS Android application can be downloaded from Android Apps Labs which is available for free distribution on Android phones. What you have to do is to visit the Android Apps Labs page and click on Install button at Save MMS and the application would be automatically installed on your Android phone with a file size of just 74kb.

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Yahoo Aviate – An App that Modifies your Home Screen with Personalization – Download from Play Store </p>
<p> Good news! No more invites needed. You can download the beautiful home screen personalization app, Aviate, which is now called Yahoo Aviate, thanks to the acquisition by Yahoo!, who made the app even more useful and better than it was earlier, and the app is now out of beta. In the new Yahoo Aviate app, you would be able to select a few topics, and the 10 frequently used apps and they get organized later with the intelligent engine of the app doing the job. </p>
<p> Setting up the work and home locations isn’t any different but there is a lot to check about, apart from that. The reason why I earlier too loved this app, was that it showed me the suggestions for places around my current location, and I didn’t have to go search for the places in search engines. Also, things get personalized when you set particular locations and set up the widgets and events for that. </p>
<p> You get to see different home screens on the several smartphones from different brands, such as the TouchWiz UI in the various Samsung Android smartphones, the innovative and better interfaces in the Sony and HTC smartphones, and the latest Amigo interface. Although I am not a fan of the TouchWiz and I really am not impressed with the Amigo in the Gionee smartphone, there are several launchers available in the Play Store but the latest one is Aviate, which takes the personalization and changes of the home screen to the next level, and you are introduced to something that makes your Android phone experience a lot different. </p>
<p> Still in the Beta version, the Aviate app takes you into a totally new home in the Android smartphone, and I am impressed with the way I can change the modes and apps to use on particular times, like in Work / Office, Home, Sleep time etc. Rather than having a wallpaper on the background, having an almost full screen photo of yours above a dock of apps looks a lot better. That’s what makes Aviate appeal well, with a lot more. Let me talk more about it before giving you a few invites if you wanted to try it out. </p>
<p> To keep it simple and easier for the users to understand, you get to see different home screens and apps based on your activity – After you wake up, while driving, during dinner and while sleeping. You don’t have to do the changes by yourself and it all happens automatically. There would be a total of three screens which could have everything that you need. The best thing here is the simple colors on the background and the differently looking icons because of that. The screenshots would portray it a lot better for you to understand. </p>
<p> Spaces – This is the section that would take care of the various changes to the apps and interface when the time shift occurs, or when you reach office from home, or when or you wake up or are about to sleep. </p>
<p> Collections – This is where the intelligence of the app comes into use, as it automatically sends the app into various sections based on whether you are using it for work, using it for social networking, for music, or for traveling and it’s some other categories based on the app type. </p>
<p> A-Z Apps – If at all you are actually confused with the collections, and don’t seem to find an app in the right section, the A-Z apps list would have all the installed applications in alphabetical order and that makes it easier for the users to search. </p>
<p> At a particular location, you can set your workplace and your home location, so that the app would remember that and whenever the device reaches that place, the apps would be categorized with the favorite apps changed based on the location. For example, at home before sleep, I would want to use the apps like Alarm, Whatsapp etc. and that would appear automatically in that place. </p>
<p> Best places around – This was quite a surprise, as the featured photo on the main screen when swiped down, would show some excellent stuff like the best places to hang around, places to eat and these would be around your current location. </p>
<p> There are two color themes – light and dark, and there’s a lot of customization possibilities with Aviate, and for the first time, I have actually liked a custom launcher as Aviate is something very neat. And very much better than the TouchWiz UI of Samsung. Only if you try, you can know what I’m talking about. This is a private beta as of now, so you will need an invite to try out the Aviate app. </p>
<p> Get Invite for Aviate Beta App! (This offer has ended, as you can directly download Aviate and start using it now) </p>

<p> I’ve been watching this launcher for a while now and it seems interesting to me. Could i get a code to test it please? </p>
<p> I saw the screenshots of the app and the intro video, its look amazing and something difrent from other launchers. </p>
<p> As a South African representative, I should certainly be amongst the first in this country to get an invite. </p>
<p> Hello. This launcher could very easily become a daily driver for lots of people. Let’s see what kind of support is coming. Can I get and invite please? </p>

<p> Cool……..is this something that will work with gingerbread ? Send me invite if its Android 2.3.6 compatible. Thanks. </p>
<p> interesting app, some likely the themer app from colorscreen. I wondered if invitations still available??? </p>
<p> The stock themes are becoming boring nowadays with literally no updates at all. You are stuck up with just changing the wall paper and maybe rearranging the icons and using icon packs, etc. But, the charm of Android is that it is open source and we should be able to make changes quite frequently so that we get to different looks and get the feeling of having the phone changed frequently. In that sense applications like this is what makes Android experience better. </p>
<p> This app looks cool , Interface is organized and its look better then touchwiz and other screen layouts </p>
<p> Please send me a invite asap 🙂 I so wanna try it 😀 </p>

<p> Background Defocus Battle – Galaxy S5 vs Elife E7 vs LG G Pro 2 vs Xperia Z2 </p>
<p> Numbers don’t really matter, is what was proven when the HTC One M8’s 4-megapixel camera was tested against the 13-megapixel shooter of the HTC One Mini 2 (mini variant of M8). Is that the case with the different brands competing each other with their latest flagships claiming to have the best camera module and the processing system which brings out the best captures? Let’s check that out. We aren’t comparing the camera in all the aspects here. One of the major reasons why a capture having a face or an object in it looks good, is the blurring of the background, or the unwanted areas in the photo. </p>
<p> For example, when you are trying to capture a still object, you would obviously want to show that object in particular and not give any importance to the background objects. That’s what the background defocusing is all about. Google recently launched an app in the Play Store, the Google Camera app, which had the Lens Blur effect which does the same what we are talking about. But how good is the background defocusing as the default feature in the camera of the smartphone. The smartphones used: </p>
<p> Sony Xperia Z2 </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S5 </p>
<p> Gionee Elife E7 </p>
<p> LG G Pro 2 </p>
<p> And here are the winners in the order based on the votes: </p>
<p> Camera 1: 59% Votes: GIONEE ELIFE E7 </p>
<p> Camera 4: 17%: SONY XPERIA Z2 </p>
<p> Camera 3: 13%: LG G Pro 2 </p>
<p> Camera 2: 11%: SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 </p>
<p> Thus, the Gionee Elife E7 could defocus the objects better and made the captures better than the other smartphones in the comparison, according to our readers! </p>

<p> How to Backup & Restore Android Phone before Installing Custom ROM </p>
<p> Question by Rajiv Bhatia: With the Samsung Galaxy S Plus is ruled out of the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich update officially by Samsung, I find that there are lots of custom ROM available which are more often same as that of the official ROM. Unofficially there are dozens of Android 4.0.3 ROM’s available for various Samsung handsets and particularly I see few like Cyanogen Mod 9 ICS, Dark Knight custom ROM ICS, SLIM ICS, Stable and Stunning Android 4.0.4 Beta 10 update and lot more at Android Advices itself. I am thinking to install the Dark Knight custom ROM on my phone to make it look new but I am worried whether my phone willn’t be bricked away with those custom ROM. It’s OK for me to try out those updates and I understand that warranty will get void with those updates but I am actually worried what if I am strucked in the middle of upgrade and what is the case if the latest installed ROM doesn’t work on my phone perfectly i.e., is there way by which we can potentially backup the existing firmware on my phone and restore it whenever required with what I had earlier? I am looking forward for step by step procedure to get the canonical answer for this rather than a one word or one sentence answer for this from the team Android Advices. </p>
<p> Android Advices Team Answer : Officially there is nothing like backing up your current ROM, etc., because the stock firmware upgrades always goes with the higher versions always and there is no look back. However if you are looking to move towards custom ROMs and firmware’s then you need to head to ClockworkMod recovery famously known as the CWM which is a custom recovery on the Android phones and tablets provides users to perform several advanced options like backup the existing ROM, installations, test out various ROMs and others. </p>
<p> Backup via ClockWorkMod Recovery </p>
<p> The ClockWorkMod recovery is the right tool for your to perform backup of existing ROM and there are various methods by which you can install ClockWorkMod recovery on your phone depending on the devices that you use. We have recently spotted one touch clock recovery for Galaxy Nexus, Motorola Droid Bionic, Droid X, Google Nexus S, Samsung Galaxy S II and lot more devices with procedure on Android advices itself. </p>
<p> By installing ClockWorkMod Recovery on your phone you can get back the original stock ROMs on your phone whenever you want it. This not only allows you to backup Stock ROMs but also the custom ROMs as well. To install ClockWorkMod Recovery on your phone it’s quite essential that your phone should be rooted first and it involves further more procedure. Here is the general procedure on how you can backup your phone existing ROM. </p>
<p> The first and the most important thing you should consider is to take root your phone and this gives you various advantages. Understand which smartphone you have and follow procedure mentioned at our blog with respective tutorial. </p>
<p> Once you are ready with rooting on your phone, now you are ready to start the process of backing up the ROM. So further we need to proceed and install the ROM Manager Android Application, which can be easily downloaded from Android Apps Labs for free. Reminding you that ROM Manager will be installed on the rooted phones only. </p>
<p> Open the ROM Manager Android application on your phone. </p>
<p> You need to flash the ClockworkMod Recovery option present in the ROM Manager. </p>
<p> Now among the options you need to select Backup Current ROM and this will ask you to provide the name for the new backup name. </p>
<p> This will further ask for SuperUser permissions on your phone and you need to grant that. </p>
<p> Once that is done, the backup of your existing ROM will be done after your phone restarts. </p>
<p> So now if something goes wrong in any of the custom ROMs which you are running you can easily restore then ROM backup which you have taken it earlier. </p>
<p> To do this, you need to open ROM Manager again, then select “Manage and Restore Backup” and then click on “Restore”. </p>
<p> Pick up the backup that you want to restore among the listed backup that you have performed earlier. </p>
<p> The phone boots up and you will get the backup of your original stock ROM. </p>
<p> That’s it. </p>
<p> Supported Handsets : ClockworkMod is supported only to limited devices. To checkout the supported devices. Please look through whether your device is supported or not. If you apply it to the wrong handset or the handset not mentioned in the list, your will end up bricking your phone. </p>
<p> Manual Backup in Stock ROM </p>
<p> When you are looking for the manual backup on your phone and you don’t want to go with custom firmware’s and stay safe, then full backup of your phone is not possible and you need to take backup of individual functions. The good things is contacts can be backed up using the Google Account and can be restored easily but for the SMS, call logs, APNs you need to find the suitable applications for that. You can find many free applications intended for each purpose in the Android Play Store. </p>

<p> How to Backup & Restore Home Screen Content (Widgets, Shortcuts) on LG G Pro 2 </p>
<p> When you have a high-end smartphone in your hands, there’s a lot of customization you can do and might do, to make it look better and be more productive than what a smartphone actually is. The LG G Pro 2 having a large 5.9-inch display has a wide screen real estate and there is a lot you can have on your home screen, where widgets, shortcuts, app icons can take their place based on the need of the user. </p>
<p> There are multiple home screens available on the LG G Pro 2 and you can have a maximum of seven home screens, which is quite enough for having a lot of widgets. We usually have these in different sizes based on how we prefer to use them, and usually the weather, connectivity control widgets are the ones which use at the maximum. There are a lot of reasons why we might be changing the launchers and the look of the interface of the phone, and that is when the entire data of the widgets and shortcuts on the home screen is gone. </p>
<p> The LG G Pro 2 comes with the direct solution for this – backing up the home screen content. How good is that? for someone who does frequent changes, it’s a perfect solution to retain the same stuff on the home screen even after changing the look whenever needed. </p>
<p> To backup the home screen on your G Pro 2, you need to go to Settings > Display > Home screen > Data and here, open the option “Home backup & restore” so that it takes you to the options where you can backup the home screen data, including the app/widget layouts and themes. </p>
<p> There are two options shown – Backup, Restore. Tap on Backup and it would ask whether to save a backup, tap on Yes and it would take no much time to create the backup and there is a history kept in the file manager whenever a backup of the home screen is done. </p>
<p> To restore a home screen which was backed up previously, you just need to go to the same screen where you will see the option for Restore, tap on that and you would see the list of backups that were done previously. This won’t be a really handy option for someone who keeps a simplicity and doesn’t change things much. </p>

<p> Baidu Changhong H5018 Cloud Phone – Specs Price & Features </p>
<p> Baidu is the biggest search engine back in China thanks to Google misery in this part of the world. We know that Google has been into smartphone of recently and following the same trend is the Baidu coming out with their first smartphone and truly it rocks with one or the other features. Let’s have a walk through the Baidu’s first smartphone named Changhong H5018. </p>
<p> Baidu Changhong H5018 Smart Phone </p>
<p> Changhong H5018 is truly a Cloud phone which is the latest sensation hitting various smartphone like HTC One X coming out with 50 GB of Dropbox cloud storage. This comes with even more, i.e., 300 GB of the cloud storage by Baidu called Baidu Cloud OS with each device even though it has the low end specifications. This smartphone comes with 3.5 inches display screen providing 320 x 480 pixel resolution and the 650 Mhz processor clearly states that the phone is an entry level smartphone. But if someone goes with the looks, they would be definitely interested to purchase this smartphone and can’t guess that it comes with introductory specifications in the Android line. The device thickness is 10.3 mm, it’s not the thinnest phone but this device on anyone’s hands looks like Nokia N9 smartphone. Other features of this smartphone includes the 3.5 mm head phone jack, micro Sd card supporting up to 32 GB of storage, Wi Fi internet access, Bluetooth, GPS, FM Radio and 1400 mAh battery. </p>
<p> Interestingly this smartphone comes with Android 2.3 Gingerbread operating system and somehow Baidu uses a Google product but the question to ask whether there is Google Play access? We confirmed that this smartphone doesn’t come out with official Google Play Store access instead Baidu has set up its own marketplace for applications and music comprising of the country based applications and widgets. </p>
<p> Well Baidu is smartphone enough to remove the Google free services like Google Maps, Gmail and others and they have personalized this with their location based traditional search with voice recognition and hand writing which allows users to speak and search on your phone. Also you get 100 GB of free data on Baidu Net Drive and you can find other applications such as Baidu Music, Baidu Map, Baidu Mobile IME and other applications. </p>
<p> Baidu has priced Changhong H5018 at 800 yuan i.e., $ 142 off contract and this comes with support to any WCDMA or GSM SIM cards. As an international consumer I would advise not to go with this smartphone as you can’t enjoy the full features but for the China residents, yes they can definitely purchase this. This smartphone would be soon available at China Unicom. </p>
<p> 4 Comments </p>
<p> We would say its designed for use in China. Some of the application will not work and big disadvantage will be no Google Play access. </p>
<p> I m from bangladesh, can i use the phone in bangladesh? H5018 how much does it cost in usd? Please tell me? </p>

<p> Earlier : BBM for Android is now Available Officially via Google PLAY Store – Download Now on Oct 22, 2013 </p>
<p> After playing hide and seek when it came to BBM for Android, Blackberry finally released the much awaited BBM for Android Client on Google PLAY Store. Blackberry has gone for a toss after launching Z10 and Q10 smartphones as it still couldn’t influence good number of users and eventually more and more number of corporate users started to move to Android. We have been hearing about the BBM for Android for a while and it’s a serious competition to the messengers like Hike etc. WhatsApp might not get impacted immediately but if WhatsApp doesn’t buck up then may be in coming years to come BBM for Android may just race ahead. Blackberry initially launched its BBM product for Aussies and then it took off its app from the PLAY Store due to some reasons and its back again. We have also mentioned the screen captures on how it looks like. </p>
<p> Installation and Configuring ofBBm seems pretty much simple, all you need to do is to just follow the simple on screen instructions. BBM for Android is now available globally. </p>
<p> Now, when Blackberry too has accepted the fact that it’s impossible to get people back from Android to BB platform, Blackberry came up with BBM for Android product to cater the people who love BBM. So let’s check out on how you can install the most awaited BBM for Android in your smartphone. While WhatsApp and Hike might just get a temporary temporary fear with BBM launching for Android, it will be totally on Blackberry now on how it will be convincing to adopt its product. We have mentioned a download link with which you can download BBM for Android. </p>
<p> Do let us know in the comments section about your thoughts on this BBM for Android getting launched. </p>

<p> BBM for Android App Review – Features, Screenshots & Settings </p>
<p> The Blackberry Messenger, i.e. BBM for Android application was published at the play store today, and many are already able to use it, while Blackberry has put several others in a waiting list. It’s a free application for the Android and iOS users, and we did try to spend some time with the BBM for Android to check out how good this one is, against the widely popular WhatsApp and WeChat messengers. In fact, there’s quite a lot of difference but for those who have friends using the Blackberry smartphones and were always sad that there was no way to keep up with them via chat clients, the solution is finally here. </p>
<p> The BBM Android app is quite secure for those who didn’t want to share their email address or phone number, but wanted to keep a distant touch with the online buddies – the BBM PIN which makes it quite secure, and although you won’t be able to choose a unique one for yourself, the BBM PIN is enough to share as your ID. </p>
<p> Adding contacts, inviting others is all quite easy after you once register or login if you already have a BBM ID (possible if you had a Blackberry smartphone earlier), and the invite can be sent either directly to the app, or via SMS. </p>
<p> The chat section looks excellent, and for me, even better than the WhatsApp, where I wasn’t able to have the profile picture of the contact in Whatsapp in the chat section, but in BBM it does add one for every conversation. The message sent would read “D” once the message is delivered to the contact. The list of contacts shows thumbnails of profile pictures and makes it easier for the user to look for the particular contact, and there’s even a search bar on the top of the contacts list to make it easier. </p>
<p> The dock list in the bottom comes handy where one can easily check for all the latest chats, the contacts, groups and the other options. Multiple contacts can be selected and a Multiperson Chat can be started from there right away, or a broadcast message can be sent to all the contacts at once, if you are making an announcement. These are a few features that one would miss in WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Swiping from left corner of the screen on any chat screen or group page would show the basic list of these: </p>
<p> Contacts </p>
<p> Groups </p>
<p> Updates </p>
<p> The conference chatting / group chat is very easy to do and it is very organized, and this is where the profile picture helps when multiple contacts are sending messages. But sending attachments is quite limited in groups or Multi Person chats, where you can send only the voice notes and nothing else. While in the single person chat, you can send pictures by either capturing live with the camera or by selecting from the gallery. </p>
<p> The Updates section shows any changes from the various contacts, and that includes friend requests accepted, change in status, profile pictures etc. </p>
<p> The BBM settings are quite a lot to play around with. Initially, the BBM would come with an icon that gets located in the status bar on the top and that shows even in the notification panel to show whenever BBM is connected to the web, but you can remove that in the Notification options of BBM settings. The tone for notifications can be changed, and even the LED light color for the notifications can be. This would be helpful when you don’t want to turn your screen on all the time to see whether it was a notification from the BBM. </p>
<p> Contacts can be blocked, and that’s one of the good things with the BBM, because you won’t be getting any annoying invites after you have once ignored the particular contact. One can easily remove the contacts from the blocked list. </p>
<p> Overall, the BBM for Android is a very decent chat client which at least connects the iOS and Android user with the Blackberry users through a common platform, and this indeed is ahead of the Whatsapp and such chat applications for a few reasons – Profile pictures in chats (we aren’t talking of the unofficial WhatsApp Plus), Privacy of phone number / email address etc. </p>

<p> Yes I would tend to agree with Sony. i’ve noticed bittorrent clients on Android to be very slow compared to PCs. Its teh same internet connection, but downloads can be dismally slow. I have tTorrent and i experienced speeds of less than 1KB/sec. </p>
<p> Downloading movies is so very slow and I only give this App a 1 star rating. I’m not sure if I will keep this App or not. </p>
<p> I have Adownloader. I also have Astro. I see the book file I downloaded, but cant figure out how to read it. Help please. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> The 20 Best New Features in the Android 4.4 KitKat OS Version </p>
<p> The much awaited Android 4.4 KitKat OS is finally launched along with the launch of the Google Nexus 5 from LG, and the new OS version packs in a lot of new features and stuff. We have listed the best as said by its makers, but we will get to know the actual best ones only after one of the devices gets the update, or when the Nexus 5 is in the hands for testing. </p>
<p> “Ok Google” listens to you </p>
<p> This was something seen in the Moto X, where “Ok Google Now” used to activate the phone and make it hear to what you say, respond to the command. Now, the KitKat version asks you to say “Ok Google” and the voice search would get activated, and the same can be used to listen to the music, send text messages and even search for directions to a place. </p>
<p> Music Player art on Lock Screen </p>
<p> The shortcuts to music play toggles were already present on the lock screen in the previous versions of Android, but the KitKat version brings a full screen album or movie art along with the toggles to control the played media. This is when a song is being played, or if you are projecting movies to a Chromecast. </p>
<p> Improvised Phone App </p>
<p> The phone app easily looks a lot different, and the contacts area shows a prioritized list where the most contacted people are listed on the top. From the same place, the user can search for the nearby places and contacts. </p>
<p> Caller ID smarter, like TrueCaller </p>
<p> Yes, we do mention TrueCaller here because it is one of the widely used apps for its help in searching for the information about the phone number, but now Google is doing something similar by searching for the phone number in the local listings of Businesses in Google Maps, if the number is unknown and not saved in your phone. </p>
<p> On-the-go Printing </p>
<p> The wireless printing that the iOS users boasted of, is now a part of the Android KitKat, where the smartphones can print to the Google Cloud Print, to HP ePrint printers or to the other printers which have got the compatible apps in the Play Store. </p>
<p> Quickoffice Integration </p>
<p> The recently redesigned Quickoffice app for Android is well integrated in this new version, and one can take full advantage of it with the direct inclusion in the OS. </p>
<p> Hangouts App Brings Messages at one place </p>
<p> The messaging app is gone, and now you would be able to see all the messages at one place – Hangouts. Google had slowly changed the Google Talk to Hangouts, and now made this as the only messaging app included in the KitKat version. To make it better, Hangouts allows you to send even GIFs and locations to your contacts. </p>
<p> Emoji in Google Keyboard </p>
<p> Gone is the plain and boring keyboard, as we see the Japanese Emoji characters smiling and expressing around in the messages and they can be directly chosen in the Google Keyboard. </p>
<p> Support for Chromecast </p>
<p> We did love Chromecast, the tiny dongle to stream the content directly to the HDTV. Now, the compatibility of that comes with every device which runs the Android 4.4 version. Content from Netflix, YouTube, Hulu Plus, and Google Play can be directly streamed to the HDTVs. </p>
<p> Web Components through Chrome </p>
<p> There are several apps which use the web content to display, and for this, now they would be using Chrome to render the web components accurately and quickly. </p>
<p> Built-in Android Device Manager </p>
<p> The Android Device Manager which was recently brought out for users to take advantage of, to keep the private information safe, is now built-in into the KitKat OS and thus every device that gets this version would see the device manager already and can use it to find the lost phone or wipe data in it. </p>
<p> New Download Manager </p>
<p> The download manager, or the Downloads app has got a redesign and now it provides the users with some extra options such as sorting of the downloaded files, in either the list or grid view. </p>
<p> Home Screen / Launcher Switching made easier </p>
<p> You remember how you used to change the home screen earlier? it was somewhere deep in the settings where you had to change to defaults, or go to the App settings and clear the defaults for that particular home screen app. Now, there’s a direct setting for that. You would just need to go to Settings > Home and you get the easy switching options. </p>
<p> Refreshed Email App </p>
<p> The email app (not sure how many are actually using this instead of Gmail) has got a redesign, with the changes being – Nested folders, photos for contacts and a better and easy navigation through the conversations. </p>
<p> HDR+ photography only on Nexus 5 </p>
<p> So, there’s something different for the Nexus 5 owners who would be receiving their device soon – HDR+ photography. Here, the camera would take a few rapid shots and combine them to come up with a single best possible shot. Claims that the night photos are sharp with less noise, but who actually tested this already? </p>
<p> Location Mode settings changed </p>
<p> This time, Google cares about your phone’s battery and thus there are options for users to choose between the high accuracy, and the battery saving location modes. Earlier, one had to keep running around the settings to toggle between Wi-Fi, mobile network and GPS to check for the location accurately, while saving the battery, but now it’s the job of your OS to do that. </p>
<p> Pedometer – Finally! </p>
<p> Only Samsung had this for now, on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the Galaxy Note 3. The pedometer would be counting each of the steps you make and the updated hardware along with the Android 4.4 will do the counting while saving a lot of battery. </p>
<p> NFC for Authorizing Payments </p>
<p> The new architecture that Google was mentioning about recently, works with most of the mobile carriers and just a simple tap with the NFC tag would be enough to authorize the transactions on the cloud, and pay with Google Wallet or other apps. </p>
<p> IR Blaster Support </p>
<p> For the smartphones which come with the Infraded blaster, the new version of Android supports the applications for remote controlling of the TVs and any other nearby devices. </p>
<p> Full Screen Wallpapers </p>
<p> The black notification panel will now have the part of the wallpaper, as the wallpaper extends through the notification panel and the system buttons. And while you try to preview a wallpaper before you set it, the new Android system would preview exactly how it would look after it’s set. </p>
<p> 4 Comments </p>
<p> Android 4.4 pretty good I really like it now just waiting for Motorola G to land in Indian stores. </p>
<p> Most of the features Samsung gave us in s4 n note 3.. Wow Samsung is doing better than Google n others. </p>
<p> Really a killer one … I like the OK Google command, integration of SMS in hangouts app, improvised phone app and on the go printing ability the most. </p>

<p> The Best Motorola Moto G Alternatives – 4 Android Phones in Competition </p>
<p> Motorola returned to India with its powerful mid range Smart phone – Moto G with a bang. The exclusive seller of the device in India is Flipkart, which has run out of stock due to the high demand of the device. Flipkart is having difficulty in meeting the demand of this device in India and many of the Moto G Smart phone lovers are disappointed due to lack of stock and they have to wait for another couple of weeks to order this device. (Check status). </p>
<p> If you can’t wait till then, we would recommend you few Smartphones from the market which are good enough to compete with the Moto G but not better than it. This is just in-case if you are in a hurry to get a new device but if you want only Moto G or can wait a bit longer, Flipkart will provide you the device in few days and for people eager to buy a new device, here are 4 devices we would like to suggest and all there are running on Android Jelly Bean Operating System and Moto G will be running on KitKat. </p>
<p> We aren’t arguing that these smartphones are any better than the Moto G, but sometimes there are reasons why you would opt to go for something other than the one from Motorola, and that’s where these phones come into the scene. </p>
<p> Karbonn Titanium S5 Plus </p>
<p> Sony Xperia M </p>
<p> Xolo Q1100 </p>
<p> Lenovo A850 </p>
<p> 1. Karbonn Titanium S5 Plus </p>
<p> Karbonn Titanium S5 Plus is a budget friendly Smart Phone with good performance. This device flaunts a 5 inch 540 x 960 p display with qHD resolution, but on the Moto G we find the HD resolution which is sharper. Other than the display all other specification are similar. The Titanium S5 Plus is powered by a 1.3 GHz quad core MediaTek processor coupled with 1 GB of RAM. </p>
<p> This device also has an 8 MP shooter at its rear where you will find a 5 MP camera in Moto G. In terms of the memory Moto G has 8 GB as well as 16 GB variants which cannot be expandable, where as Titanium S5 Plus has 4 GB internal memory that can be expandable using micro SD card slot and both the devices are Dual SIM variants. Moreover this device will be available for Rs. 10,250 on Flipkart. </p>
<p> 2. Sony Xperia M </p>
<p> Sony Xperia M is a good enough device for a price tag of Rs. 11,699 and more over it comes from Sony with a 4 inch display. The handset is powered by a 1 GHz dual core Snapdragon S4 processor, coupled with 1 GB of RAM and Adreno 305 GPU (same RAM and GPU in Moto G).The camera on both the devices is same at 5 MP. The internal memory on the Sony Xperia M is 4 GB that can be extended up to 32 GB via micro SD card. This device is available on Flipkart for Rs. 11,699. </p>
<p> 3. Xolo Q1100 </p>
<p> The Q1100 is a Smart Phone Xolo that can stand along the Moto G with similar kind of specifications. The Xolo Q1100 has a 5 inch display with 720 x 1280 p resolutions and is powered by a quad core Snapdragon 400 processor clocking at 1.4 GHz coupled with 1 GB RAM and Adreno 305 GPS as in Moto G. The on board memory on the device is 8 GB that can be extended via micro SD card slot and the camera on it is 8 MP that is better than the Moto G’s 5 MP. The device is priced at Rs. 14999 on Flipkart and is a pretty good competitor to the Moto G. </p>
<p> 4. Lenovo A850 </p>
<p> Lenovo A850 is another device in the line that can give good competition to the Moto G which has a 5.5 inch capacitive touch screen display and a Dual SIM variant running on Android 4.2 Jelly Bean Operating System. The device is powered by a quad core MTK 658M processor and has the 1 GB of RAM with a 5 MP shooter at its back. The internal storage of the Lenovo A850 is 4 GB that can extendable up to 32 GB via micro SD card and the cost of the device is at Rs. 12149 on Flipkart. </p>

<p> I would say Micromax Canvas Magnus and Tubro are also good option for MOTO G. But I want to ask one question here since in country like India or any other country people also choose company for their customer service fro which XOLO and Karbonn is lagging behind. So why should I go for Karbonn and XOLO for just a cheaper price. </p>

<p> 7 Best Alternatives for Moto X Android Smart Phones – Budget Smart Phones List </p>
<p> The official seller for Moto X in India, Flipkart, had tried to create some buzz while launching this smartphone today, but we did observe that although Flipkart listed this with a limited availability, none of the color variants got sold out. There could be different reasons for that – doubt on Motorola after the acquisition by Lenovo, or the internal specs being not so high, but for us, this is a very decent device. </p>
<p> For those who are looking for the alternatives to see which could be some similar choices from the other brands, here are the best ones. </p>
<p> The Grand 2 from Samsung was recently launched, with a 5.25-inch HD display, a Quad-core processor clocking at 1.2 GHz and there’s 1.5 GB of RAM with a neat 2600 mAh battery. The predecessor to this had created quite some buzz for being one of the lone devices in the market in the mid-range pricing. The Grand 2 thus came in as a perfect successor with some improved specs and neat pricing, at Rs. 21000. Check out the comparison of Moto X and Grand 2. </p>
<p> Starting with price of Rs. 25479, the Elife E7 from Gionee could be a perfect alternative, especially if you aren’t bothered about the screen size and are more keen towards the internal powering. There’s the Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB of RAM and a brilliant 16-megapixel camera on the rear, 8-megapixel on the front. What else would you want? the only issue for us is the interface, Amigo 2.0 on the Android 4.2.2, while the Moto X would have Android 4.4.2 OS with some good features. It’s priced around Rs. 26000. </p>
<p> The Desire 600C comes with a pricing which exactly matches that of the Moto X, and the specs too are quite competitive – a quad-core Snapdragon processor, 8MP rear shooter, 4.5-inch qHD display (this is where the Moto X looks way better), 1GB RAM and 2100 mAh battery. Surely not the best in any way, but just an alternative if someone isn’t a fan of Motorola. Another plus for the users could be that it is a Dual-SIM smartphone. The phone is priced at Rs. 23999. </p>
<p> Another HTC device in the same price range, this one comes with a 5-inch display having the same resolution as the Desire 600C and a quad-core processor at 1.2 GHz, and it has the same 8MP camera on the rear side (although this can record Full HD videos). It’s Dual-SIM, and one can expand the storage to 64GB with the MicroSD card. The price of this one is Rs. 23100. </p>
<p> This is a very neat device, not just by looks but with the specs too. It’s coming with the 5.5-inch Full HD display, and internally the device is powered by the Intel Atom Dual-core processor clocking at 2GHz. The camera on the back is a good 13MP shooter which can record Full HD videos, and the phone has the USB OTG feature which the Moto X doesn’t have. Priced at Rs. 22,999 this is another good alternative for the Motorola’s flagship phone. </p>
<p> The Ascend P6 from Huawei has got a 4.7-inch HD display, a quad-core processor clocking at 1.5 GHz and a 8MP primary + 5MP secondary camera combo. Having the 2GB of RAM, the device has 2000 mAh battery which does get drained a bit faster than normal, thanks to the Emotion UI. This phone is available for the price of Rs. 23990 for the white one, while the black variant costs Rs. 24999. </p>
<p> Predecessor to the Elife E7, this device would surely deserve a place in the best competitors / alternatives, because of the pricing and also for the display. The 5-inch display has the Full HD resolution, and the only disadvantage against the other devices could be the Mediatek chipset, but you still would be happy to see the 2GB RAM, 13MP rear shooter and a 5MP front one. It was launched at around Rs. 23000, but now is available for Rs. 18,999. </p>

<p> Beware of Tapsnake Virus Warning on Android Phones – Details, Instructions </p>
<p> There is a new fake virus scare in the Android market called Tapsnake which is actually an old Virus reported in 2010. This fake Tapsnake virus scare is being spread through certain websites which when visited a pop up box appears and mentions that your Android device is affected by ‘Trojan: MobileOS/Tapsnake’ and a free antivirus is being offered to get rid of the virus with a countdown times also shown. People are getting fooled by the Fake Virus Scare and are downloading the App through this pop up box </p>
<p> Trojan: MobileOS/Tapsnake is completely FAKE and this is just a trick to make Android phone and Tablet users to download Apps. </p>
<p> We have tested this by opening the same site where we got this threat in our Android Phone and we got the same alert in the pop up box and as Trojan: Tapsnake is a Virus which affects the android OS this alert is fake and just a way to make users download and instal Apps. </p>
<p> The Fake Virus Alert looks like this: Text shown in the image: ANDROID VIRUS DETECTED A site you recently visited has infected your phone with (Trojan: MobileOS/Tapsnake) Press OK to remove the threat. </p>
<p> If you have already downloaded the app after seeing this message in your device, there is no need to panic as nothing harmful might not have happened but just that you have downloaded an App by clicking on the Install App now button in the Pop up box which have seen earlier. </p>
<p> This technique is called as “Scareware” which makes people believe that a Virus or Spyware has been downloaded and installed on your device from the site you have visited and it asks you install Antivirus App which is actually some other App which is being installed on your device. </p>
<p> How to know if it is the Real Tapsnake Trojan Virus: If you have made the mistake of installing the real Tapesnake Trojan Virus in your Android device you will know immediately why the Virus is named Tapsnake as you will see a retro Snake Game on your device and the Virus is mainly to Spy on your Location and when the virus infects your device your location will be shared with the person who wants to know your Location. </p>
<p> What should be done to remove the Tapsnake Virus and to avoid getting it in your Phone ? Installing a Reputed Anti Virus like McAfee Antivirus, Norton antivirus is recommended and not to install some illegal version of the antivirus. Go for legitimate virus from Play Store or any valid App Store. Never install any illegal or apps from apk files etc which might be a source of these kind of Viruses. </p>

<p> Thanks for a great tip, tho I dont like your title. I was looking for something to remove ads from applications, not just my browser. Have to say that some ads really do breake the good experience a user could get from the application. A good example would be when to ad actually appear above all content in the application, and just stays there for about 5 seconds before it goes where it belong – away.. 🙂 </p>
<p> Well you can say that but its like more often blocking rather than removing the ads!! </p>
<p> Its written out there “Ad Free is an Android application which serves the purpose of blocking ads on your Android browser. This app only works for rooted phones and if you are one those who has that handset then Ad Free is free for you to install.” </p>

<p> How to Block Children from Buying Inappropriate Apps from Android Market </p>
<p> Parents should control their children by taking what they do and they don’t. From limiting them to access porn on the web to using the smartphones, as a parents you should be careful enough. One thing I should praise Amazon Kindle Fire tablet is that though it doesn’t have access to Android official Play Store instead it routes you to use Amazon Apps Store, it loaded with content filters which is safe to use for all the users. </p>
<p> Android Play Store previously known as the Android Market, contains both paid and free applications. If you have linked up your Google Wallet or Credit card then you can easily purchase those apps within no time. It’s really good, one time add Credit Card and you are automatically linked up to purchase apps. But this might be a downside if your children gets hang of your phone and purchases any application. Parents who want to prevent their children from buying inappropriate apps in the Android Play Store have to go with the following settings – </p>
<p> Launch Android Play Store on your mobile phone or tablet. </p>
<p> Tap on Menu and go through Settings. </p>
<p> Tap on Content filtering and this is the option to set content filtering level to restrict app which can be downloaded. </p>
<p> You need to uncheck the type of applications which you want to hide and you can find four ratings like Everyone, Low maturity, Medium maturity, High maturity. When you are done tap on OK. </p>
<p> The above settings are enough for you to change the content filtering levels but without settings a PIN to it any one can change it, maybe its your kids smart enough to change it without your notice. </p>
<p> Its up to the users whether they want to set the pin or not but we recommended to setup PIN. After setting up the PIN, if you are buying any application you would be asked to provide the PIN and there by preventing you from purchasing of the apps. </p>
<p> The PIN option is just located just below content filtering. </p>
<p> Tap on it and it will ask you to provide a 4 digit PIN. When you are done tap on OK. </p>
<p> You would be once again asked to re type to confirm your new PIN. </p>
<p> Now you have to tap on Use Pin for purchases, which will ensure that whenever you purchase any apps, it will be asking for the PIN, failing to provide correct PIN will not allow any users to download paid app. </p>
<p> You would see that just above content filtering there is the option of Unlock settings. Now in case in future if you want to unlock these settings on your phone or tablet, you need to restart your phone and you will see Unlock Settings at the same path of Android Play Store > Menu > Settings open for you. </p>
<p> That’s it, done. This was all about preventing unwanted purchases from Android Play Store. </p>
<p> I am sure you would have easily understood this and if you have anything to say or comment, please feel free to do that. And spread the reach d of Android Advices through Facebook, Twitter and Google +. </p>

<p> Block or Hide Android Market to Avoid Accidental Purchases with Advanced App Locker </p>
<p> It has not so been long that Android has just started its journey and within no time it has evolved as the widely used operating system for mobile phone and tablet PCs. Android operating system allows users to download applications, widgets, tools and games via Android Market, now called as Google Play Store. Over the time Google Play Store has been evolved to the current needs of the users. Until now users comments and complaints about the hassle of buying Android applications but as the time passed, Play Store has been evolved and it has been more user friendly. </p>
<p> One of the useful features Google has rolled out to the Play Store is it easy to understand in app purchases. It’s so easy that even a first time user can purchase an Android application if it’s paid one unlike the other OS marketplace which requires many things from the user end. Thanks to Google services like Google Checkout which makes it easier of linking your credit card for safer use. But just wait we hear a lot more stories and questions form the users that they have accidentally purchased an application. Users let their young ones to play games on their phones and they aren’t familiar enough that few might ask for real money. Remember that unwanted purchases are loss of money to you and these purchases cannot be refunded unless you get in touch or complain to the developers with a genuine complain of non-working or fault of the application, wherein chances are less. So did you even end up billing unwanted for any Android applications either by you or by your kid? </p>
<p> Here in this article we are exploring the ways by which as parents you can guard your children from such kind of occurrence. Follow the methods below and avoid your unwanted out cash flow. </p>
<p> Block Android Market </p>
<p> With Seal Android application you can protect any Android application which is installed on your phone with a password or pattern lock so that no body else can use it and if you are using it, you need to enter the set password or the pattern lock. </p>
<p> Seal Android application is available at $ 3 nearly. The security which is missed on your Android phone is covered with Seal Android application. </p>
<p> As soon as you install Seal Android applications on your phone, it will ask you to set password the pattern lock code. Once that is done, you need to select the Android application in the next screen to whom you need to apply those password or patter lock code. So if the Android Play Store is locked in Seal until the person approaches you, he can’t open an application and buy without you say. </p>
<p> Another application we look down is the Advanced App Locker which works more or less same as Seal. Its very clear working of Seal but Advanced App Locker will make users fool with force close dialogs or with just blank screen. If any unknown person is trying to purchase an application this will application will stop them with a broken page and the only way to unlock is the tap the corner of the screen for a predetermined times to open the app. Now that predetermined time to tap on the corner is set by the phone owner. The Advanced App Locker is available for $2 and there is a free version also but its missing several options like custom text lock screens. </p>
<p> Remove Credit Card Details from Google Check Out </p>
<p> Google’s officially launched Google Checkout long back even before the Android launch. The Android Play Store is connect with your Google Checkout and if you are among those users who don’t even buy a lot of apps then you don’t probably use Google Checkout much. When you setup your phone or add a Google account to your phone, the phone by default will ask you for certain details to be filled and in that one of the part is the Google Checkout wherein you need to provide your Credit Card details. If those are entered you can directly purchase Android applications on your mobile phone on the go. It’s so easy, click on purchase and done. If you are looking to block unwanted applications purchases then please consider removing your Credit Card details from the Google Checkout. </p>
<p> To remove Credit Card from your Google Checkout, head over to Google Check out web page and then on the left side of the screen find and click the option of ‘Edit Payment details’. Follow through the link and you will get a list of your account, just remove your credit card and carrier information using the delete button. So this way when you are purchasing applications intentionally or unintentionally Android Play Store will pull the information directly from the Google Checkout site. So if you have no credit card added in the Google Checkout you can buy applications. Simple and easy! </p>
<p> The method feasible enough for general purpose use and most advised by us is to use the Seal application to lock down the individual applications as this is not only effective but makes the task easier and automated along with the privacy of your applications as well. </p>

<p> How to Set up Blocking Mode (Do Not Disturb) on Samsung Galaxy S5 </p>
<p> A smartphone is supposed to be smart with the functions, and one of them is the possibility to make a few functions available only at particular times, and this has to be automatic. The Do Not Disturb mode, which is available in most of the high-end smartphones now, is also there in the Samsung Galaxy S5, but the name is a bit different as they call it as “Blocking Mode” although it does the job in no different way. </p>
<p> What does the Blocking Mode in Galaxy S5 do? </p>
<p> Blocking mode would turn off the notifications, alarms and timers, and most importantly, it would block all the calls and for that, you don’t need to be entering the device into airplane mode. The good thing about this is the timing you can set for this to get activated automatically. </p>
<p> How to Activate Blocking Mode and set it up? </p>
<p> To activate the blocking mode in your Samsung Galaxy S5, you need to go to Settings > Personalization > Blocking mode </p>
<p> Toggle the option on, and then you will be able to select the particular options based on what you want to block. You can choose to keep the incoming calls coming while disable all other notifications, the alarm and timer. The blocking mode can be set for always, or for particular times which we usually prefer for nights, where unneeded calls are to be blocked. </p>
<p> There is an option to filter contacts from whom you want the incoming calls and notifications, even when the Blocking mode is turned on. The options available in the “Allowed contacts” section include: </p>
<p> None </p>
<p> All Contacts </p>
<p> Favorites </p>
<p> Custom – which can be edited and you can add particular contacts who you want to allow </p>
<p> Go into that you can add the contacts in that list. The custom list would be kept saved if in case you select the other options and again in future, wanted the same custom list to be allowed for contacting you when the device is in blocking mode. </p>
<p> It’s no rocket science again, but an important feature and tip for the Samsung Galaxy S5 users. Check out about the Hidden menu key in Galaxy S5 and learn more tips and tricks in the Samsung Galaxy S5 section. </p>

<p> How to Block Phone Balance USSD Updates as Popup Messages on Android </p>
<p> The USSD / MMI requests are something that could be done when you wanted to perform some network related functions, like checking the balance of your phone, or the IMEI code of your phone and a few internal functions of the phone, but when these requests happen automatically and you see the balance updates every time you make a call or send SMS, it gets annoying. Especially in the Indian networks, once a message is sent, or even when the phone loses the data network connection, the balance is sent promptly and this keeps coming when the connection is glitchy. Apart from that, when you are using some messaging offer and have free messages to send, there isn’t any need at all to get the balance update when you know you are not going to get any deduction in the account balance. </p>
<p> There are several applications in the Google Play Store which would help in blocking the SMS messages or notifications but none of those have been successful in blocking the USSD messages that are sent by the network. One of them which would be making things easier for people is the Balance Update / USSD blocker which targets the notification and message blocking by specific keywords and strings. </p>
<p> Using this app, you could block the messages: – Which contain a particular string that you want to block – Which contain a list of keywords that are separated by comma – Which contain specified regular expressions that can be matched to block the messages </p>
<p> The Balance Update / USSD blocker app has got a message log of itself, which stores the latest 25 messages and these come with an indicator whether the message was blocked or allowed to view. </p>
<p> One can choose to show the notifications / balance once a day or week and this would show you the first balance update and then block the other ones for the entire day. This would come to good use when you have got the free message offers and would want to keep a check once a day whether the offer is still active or has expired. </p>
<p> The app is free of ads, and you get to see the options page only when you want to make any changes, or else it would work in the background and you don’t need to be worried about anything once you have set the things up for blocking the balance updates. </p>
<p> Once you install the app after downloading it from the Google Play Store, you need to restart your phone once before configuring or start using it. </p>
<p> Tip for using: To configure or block the balance status messages, you need to specify the keywords that come in those messages and whenever the app notices a message with the same keywords, it would block them. The blocking includes even the USSD message apart from the normal SMS. </p>
<p> The app is available for free in the Play Store. Download it from here. </p>

<p> USSD Box does help in removing annoying messages sent from your Mobile Network Operator. </p>
<p> ZOPO ZP200 is the first Android phone with MTK6575 chip, the new generation 1GHz 3G smartphone processor. The MT6575 is a single core Cortex-A9 solution with an unidentified 5-series PowerVR GPU on board and an HSPA modem. The 1GHz core probably won’t win and benchmark competitions, but it’s enough to push Android 4.0 to a qHD screen, power through 720p video and capture shots with an 8 megapixel sensor. It even is capable of supporting 3D displays. </p>

<p> I have used this app. for a long time, and are very happy/glad for it because, it really has increased my battery time for the better, BUT, I need among other, specially ONE setting – how to set “Night schedule” from 23:30.06:00 to any other “self decided” time setting?.

<p> Bulk Move Apps to SD Card & Get New Apps Notifications </p>
<p> Some of the Android phones (until its Samsung Galaxy S or S II) come with low inbuilt storage and its regular notice that you will receive low space warning. So what do you do in such kind of situation? It’s clear that you would be moving your apps to your storage card. The stock Android has the feature of moving the app installed on your mobile phone to SD card. It is located at Settings > Applications > Manage Applications. Under that you will get the list of apps installed on the your phone memory which are download and then tap on the particular app, from the option click on Move to SD card. </p>
<p> But a major drawback of this is that you need to do it manually and more worse it will do it for each app at a time and so you would require to spent a good time. So how would you do it quickly? Of course, the only way to do it is to find an application in Android market which can do this for you. I was lucky to find out App2SD which clearly tells by its name the purpose of it and the app name it’s easy to remember. </p>
<p> As you install the App2SD and run it you will see three tabs name – On Phone, on SD card and Phone Only. The One Phone shows the list of apps which are on phone memory, On SD card shows apps on SD card and phone only which cannot be moved. </p>
<p> To bulk move apps first select On Phone tab then hit menu button and then choose Move All. </p>
<p> This start moving apps one by one automatically. </p>

<p> Bump Charge your Android Phone to Double Battery Life – Official Tip </p>
<p> For all those who are not really happy with the battery life of the device, can now optimize the device so that one can make the most out of their device. Please note that this tip has come Officially from HTC which we have managed to get it for you. There are some tips by HTC with which they are not just providing you the tips to save on the battery life but also HTC is doing its bit from their end also such as optimizing the internal software so that the battery consumption is least. Please note that following the instructions which we have mentioned will not harm the device in any manner. All the data services like 3G / 4G consumes a lot of battery at the end user level. Additionally, Sprint is working to optimize 4G network settings to improve battery life for customers in 4G markets which will further add up the convenience for the users. Please note that all these tips mentioned below can be applied by all the users of Samsung, HTC, Motorola, LG etc. </p>
<p> Steps with which you can Extend the Battery Charge: </p>
<p> WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth, and display brightness all greatly impact battery performance, so lots always important for you to only make use of these services only when you need it the most. Especially when the battery is minimum, you need to turn all these core features so that battery will last more till you find a place to charge up your device. </p>
<p> You can also adopt the bump Charge where in you need to follow the below mentioned steps so as to make the most of your battery charge. </p>
<p> Turn your device ON and Charge the device for 8 hours or more, </p>
<p> Unplug the device and Turn the phone OFF and charge for 1 hour, </p>
<p> Unplug the device Turn ON wait 2 minutes and Turn OFF and charge for another hour Your battery life should almost double, as per the htc executives they have tested themselves and found out the there is a huge improvement in the battery life. </p>
<p> Note : Please note that Official means that a HTC Representative told these steps which are going to double the battery life and this has been tested by many people. </p>
<p> If you follow the above mentioned steps, HTC claims that users have reported a maximum battery life of around 10 hours even in the rigorous usage which includes calling, listening to the music, using data services for most of the time. Please note that this may differ marginally again from user to user. </p>
<p> Do let us know in the comments section just in case if you have faced any issues in the process of following the above mentioned steps as we will try to address the same at the earliest. Just in case if you too have some tips on battery saving then you too can mentioned the same in the comments section below. </p>
<p> Will this work if I have my phone for about 4 months by now and I never did this, so maybe it’s already calibrated,but not in a good way? </p>

<p> NEEL I HAVE DONE THIS TIP AND IT SEEM TO BE WORKING ON MY GT-I9000 BUT THE QUESTION IS IF I APPLY THE SPEEDMOD KERNEL ON MY GT-I9000 WILL I HAVE TO DO ALL THESES STEPS AGAIN(xwjw4)? </p>
<p> Hi, I have a question about this methode : how often we can do this procedure ( once a month, once a week…. ) ??? Thanks </p>
<p> Nobody want to comments that …. I test this methode once on my phone and it seems to work, but the question is, for how many days ??? </p>
<p> This morning I’ve finished that operations but no result… The only started sensor during today was GPS (for about 10 minutes) and DATA (almost the same time). At 5,30 P.M. the battery indicator was nearly to 10% and the message on the lockscreen was “Please recharge”. My phone is running a custom ROM (CyanogenMod 7.2 RC1 by vo-1 MIRACLE Edition) and it’s a Samsung Galaxy Ace. </p>
<p> Bas! Let me guess, you tried the procedue one time. On an old battery then concluded it didn’t work, right? </p>
<p> Well, I tried this today. Will wait until later to conclude. </p>
<p> I would like to offer my suggestion. </p>
<p> My guess is that, this technique is for ‘reconditioning the battery’. Now have it’s effect you need to recalibrate battery after every hourly pump charge, otherwise the firmware will not allow charging beyond what it thinks to be 100% or full charge. Putting phone off and pump charging means that the firmware is out of picture. So a recalibration teaches the firmware a new high mark of battery capacity. </p>
<p> I used batterycalibration ( a free app) for this. But you need to be rooted and grant superuser access to this app. </p>
<p> Bas! Let me guess, you tried the procedue one time. On a old battery then conclude, right? </p>
<p> How can I charge the phone, if I have unplugged it – as in Number 2… </p>
<p> “Unplug the device and Turn the phone OFF and charge for 1 hour” </p>
<p> …. It’s okay you don’t all need to jump at me… It’s Easter Sunday and I am in a good mood. </p>
<p> Ive done this process to calibrate smartphone batteries before on 3 seperate HTC Desire HD batteries. </p>
<p> It didn’t work for my phone (Samsung Galaxy S, GT i9000). I followed all the steps.. Too bad </p>
<p> Me either..on samsung s2..After following the steps, i found out battery life just the same..a hoax maybe </p>
<p> Me either..on samsung s2..After following the steps, i found out battery life just the same..a hoax maybe. </p>
<p> Me either..on samsung s2..After following the steps, i found out battery life just the same. </p>
<p> How long will the positive effects of this process last? How often will the process need to be repeated? </p>
<p> Its more like you need to experiment and record the results and share the same with others. This is something new and everyone is still trying it out. </p>
<p> This is only a guess but I think if you ran this routine say once a month it would probably help keep the battery at optimal performance. Try it once and if it improves then repeat it. If you don’t seem to get any benefit from the bump charging then don’t bother. Again you can’t hurt anything for trying. </p>
<p> Why do people always ask the same questions over and over again? Yes it will work with any phone, yes it’s safe to try, and yes there’s a chance it will work. </p>
<p> The key thing to understand is that this does not harm your phone or battery in any way. No tools or hacks required. It’s simply an attempt to condition the battery to last a little longer. I have tried this on many different phones with varying test results using software to monitor changes. So my test result are by numbers and not the placebo effect. Sometimes there’s a reasonable improvement and sometimes marginal. </p>
<p> Either way it’s safe to try and why not? The worst that can happen is you don’t get any improvement at all. A battery does deteriorate over time regardless, so any attempt to extend or improve it’s longevity is worth a shot. </p>
<p> This is the Best Comment i have come through in the last 50000 comments i have moderated on this blog. Being the Admin i sometimes get mad reading the comments here because people always expect us to try out everything and then share the experience. Its clearly mentioned that this is more like an experiment which everyone can give a try and see if it works or not, while many have reported that it works for them. Thanks for understanding and replying in a positive manner Dan. :=) </p>
<p> You’re welcome. I appreciate the compliment. Please keep your formula because I prefer to have crowd sourced opinions versus single columnist opinions. Most sites seem to have a one sided view. This was my first time on your site and I plan to visit regularly. </p>
<p> I have not tried this trick so far with my Samsung phone. But, yes, I tried a similar trick with my elctric shaver. I found that it lasts for more days, if it is put to charge again after a full charge (flashing LED) followed by a small interval (1/2 hour). Since rechargeable batteries work on same principle, the trick should work for phone batteries also. </p>
<p> Are you sure this will work? Far as i know, when a Samsung S2 is fully charged, it IS fully charged and can you do nothing about it. ie lets say its fully charged, i unplug the phone, put the phone OFF, and try to charge for one hour…it will say fully “charged please unplug”. My question now is…will it STILL charge, even though its fully charged? </p>
<p> Longetivity is the one I tried when my Phone is like 20% battery remaining and I dont have a place to charge. there is a “phone only “option which basically turns off everything…really helped me in need </p>
<p> I dont think this is in any ways going to calibrate battery. Any Scientific study behind this or hit and trial. Since no harm hence any body will try this, those who get some extended time may feel good otherwise its a PLACEBO effect. Even when i give simple dw injection in medical wards pts feel good. just like that…. </p>
<p> Probably you are right but since this suggestion is from a HTC Employee the chances are that it would have been tried and tested by many users and most of them have reported some positive results. Does not cost trying it out right? </p>
<p> There is a scientific reason behind this and I am sure it will help others also because it has helped me. My battery life was around 24 hrs. but now it has been upgraded to around 40 hrs. Whatsay! Thanx Neal. </p>

<p> How to Bypass Exchange Security Policy in Android – Easy Tutorial </p>
<p> Are you using the Virtual private Network (VPN) mail access in your Android powered smart phone and are really fed up with the frequent pass code unlock feature which by default is set by your System Admin? Then here is a trick for all you guys to bypass this pass code thing as you can now benefit from the “Latest” as the companies not yet have come up with proper support structure for the Ice Cream Sandwich Android 4.0.1 version and which is the loophole here. So, keeping this article there are just few requirements which you need to satisfy so as to disable the pass code entry to unlock the phone on VPN powered phones. </p>
<p> Note: Please note this trick may be against the IT Policy, so you need to check the same with your IT System Admin. We should not be held responsible in any manner if any action is taken on you. </p>
<p> Download Google Email.apk and ICS Email Zip to your phone so that you can then install the same in your phone which we will see in the due course of this article. This works only on the de odexed ROMs. </p>
<p> Procedure to Bypass Exchange Security Policy in Android: </p>
<p> So, assuming that you have followed all the list of pre requisites, you need to now proceed to open the Root Explorer application and then head to system/app, mount as r/w and then delete the email.apk after which you need to reboot the device. </p>
<p> Now, next up you need to copy the “Email Google.apk” to the system/app and then change the permissions to Owner (Read / Write), Group (Read) and then for for Others (Read). </p>
<p> Please note that just in case if the above method didn’t work for you then all you need to do is to first Download ICS Email Zip package in your computer and move the same as it id to your phone without modifying / changing the contents of the package. </p>
<p> Once you place this package in your phone, you need to turn OFF the device so that you can get into the recovery mode by either from the ROM Manager or from entering your phone into the recovery mode manually. </p>
<p> In the recovery mode, select “install zip from sd card” and choose the file which is named as “”. Once the application of update is finished, you will then be back to the recovery screen. In recovery mode screen, select “++++ Go Back ++++” and then choose the option of “Reboot System now”. So, now you need to configure the VPN access either manually or can visit to your system admin to configure the same. </p>

<p> How to Calibrate Android Mobile Phone Battery </p>
<p> The mobile phones are powered by rechargeable batteries included in the mobile phone itself. Most of the mobile phones provide 1 to 3 days of battery life and it depends on what kind of material with which battery is made up of. The Android operating system powered by Google eats up the battery a lot more than any other operating system because in Android there is continuous synchronization of data. If you get more than 24 hours of battery life on your phone then it’s phenomenal. </p>
<p> For those who love to change the ROMs on their phone often, you would be obsessed calibrating your phone’s battery very often. For those who have flashed their mobile handset with custom ROM, they are advised to charge their mobile phone to 100 % battery and then update the firmware. Suppose of if update the firmware if you have 50 % battery life, then the new custom ROM will consider you 50 % battery life as the full battery stats and thus it would provide you half the battery as specified by your phone manufacturer. In such cases the battery calibration is required to gain 100 % battery backup as specified and let us go through some of the basic calibration process. </p>
<p> Android Phone Battery Calibration </p>
<p> Before proceeding to the battery calibration steps you should have Clock Work Recovery installed on your phone and you must be aware on how to get into recovery mode of your phone. For most of the Samsung mobile phone the recovery mode can be accessed by holding the volume UP button, OK button and then holding both simultaneously you need to press the power button until you see the blue screen background on your phone. The video here would be explaining you how to get your phone in recovery mode. For most of HTC handsets you need to hold the volume down button and then press power button. </p>
<p> Here is the procedure to Calibrate your phone Battery – </p>
<p> First, you should power off your mobile phone and pull the battery and then re-insert it. </p>
<p> Now you should know how to get your mobile phone in recovery mode.httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIyYHfb1Afg </p>
<p> Now you need to go to Advanced option where in you would be navigating using the volume up and volume down button and using the power button you would be selecting the option. In the Advanced option would be selecting the ‘Battery Stats’ and then you would have to select “Wipe Cache”. Now that would wipe out the what is taken as 100 % during the custom ROM installation. </p>
<p> Now to determine the 100 % specified battery life of your phone, it can be achieved in three ways basically – </p>
<p> The Battery Drain Way – </p>
<p> Drain your phone battery until its fully dead or till it switches off automatically. </p>
<p> Now charge your phone normally to the full battery. </p>
<p> You must have Clock Work Recovery app installed on your phone, you should reboot to clock work recovery and then wipe the battery stats found under the “Advanced” option and then reboot the phone. </p>
<p> Now you should look out the ways to quickly drain out your battery now. So better turn on Bluetooth, Wi-Fi hotspot, Wi-Fi, flashlight, camera to make your battery again dead. </p>
<p> Now charge your phone normally to the full and you are ready to get extra battery life added to your phone. </p>
<p> Power OFF Charge Method – </p>
<p> In the Power OFF method you would be charging your phone to 100 % when it’s ON. </p>
<p> Unplug the charger from the phone, Power off your phone and then charge it up to 100 % again when it’s on power OFF state. </p>
<p> Now again unplug the charger from phone. Power it ON and then charge it again to 100 % while the phone is ON. </p>
<p> Unplug the charger and then reboot the phone using the Clock Work Recovery. </p>
<p> In Clock Work Recovery options, go to Advanced and then select the clear battery stats options. </p>
<p> Power ON and charge the mobile to full, enjoy. </p>
<p> ON /OFF Way </p>
<p> When your phone is powered ON, charge the battery until the LED turns BLUE. </p>
<p> Unplug the phone from the charger and wait till the LED turns OFF. </p>
<p> Now power OFF your phone. </p>
<p> When the phone is OFF, plug the charger into the phone and charge it up until the LED turns Blue. </p>
<p> Still the phone is OFF and unplug the charger, wait until the LED turns OFF. </p>
<p> Now Power ON the phone. </p>
<p> Wait until the phone is booted completely and then power OFF the phone again. </p>
<p> When the phone is OFF again plug the adapter into your phone and charge it up until the LED turns blue. </p>
<p> Now boot your phone in recovery mode and once you see the blue screen, navigate to Advanced option using the volume up and down keys and then choose the option ‘Wipe Battery Stats’. </p>
<p> Now Power OFF your phone and use it normally. </p>
<p> Do let us know if you come across any issues during the battery calibration steps and we would try to resolve those issues. You can make use of comment section below to communicate with us and explain your issues clearly. </p>

<p> Hi, Thanks for this helpful post. I just tried the “The Battery Drain Way” but when im charging on off state i already charged more than 6hours and not being full, so i decided to open in and do the “Power OFF Charge Method” but again on the step on charging when OFF state, i charged it more than 6hours, and still it happens to be not yet full charge and again i open it and continue with the steps. </p>
<p> My question is, normally how much time does it take to be fully charged when OFF state? Does my 2nd method calibrates my battery correctly? or still not? Also, can i do these methods several times? </p>
<p> what about keeping the battery to 100% and re installing the firmware????? hey neal contact my e mail id. i want to ask some questions. </p>
<p> Hello, thanks for the info. I noticed that there are 2 different calibration methods on your web site. This one here, and the other one on this link http://androidadvices.com/calibrate-battery-maximum-life-android-smart-phones/ Since the two of them are very different (this one with about using electrical charger during cahrging and the other one using an USB cable), I wonder which one of them is better and which one do you recommend. Also, there are some inconsistencies in the *POWER OFF/POWER ON METHOD* described above. You wrote that we should clear battery stats in recovery mode while phone is on the charger (you didn’t mention that it should be took off from the charger), and also you wrote in the end *Now Power OFF your phone and use it normally*. Did you mean *Power ON your phone* instead?? Thanks…… </p>
<p> ei guys..! just new here.. just wanna know what is a clock work recovery and why is it important b4 doing ds calibration.. i wanna try ds with my ace..thanx a lot! </p>
<p> Will this method work to calliberate my LG Optimus 1 mobile phone battery? </p>
<p> Also kindly tell me whether Andriod 4.0 has arrived and can be installed in my mobile? </p>
<p> Yes, this can work for any Android phone. Try it out! </p>
<p> Android 4.0 hasn’t been launched and no idea when it would arrive for LG Optimus 1. </p>
<p> ROM Manager is the officially available App at Android Market. The problem is something else. </p>
<p> Would this really only recalibrate the battery or maybe delete some data/restore the phone to factory default/else?? </p>
<p> @Yogesh Patel, What is the purpose of calibrating a battery? Does your phone have to be a rooted phone in order for it to work? I do not have root. I have Samsung Galaxy s2 ATT i777 version. </p>
<p> i love my samsung galaxy s i9003 but the phone is no more. i flashed the phone with a custom ROM and since then it has refused to boot, go into recovery mode, go into download mode, name it it has been like that for a month i am depressed cuz i love the gt i9003..its so sad can someone rescue my phone? </p>
<p> Nothing happens to your phone, the method will fetch you battery life as specified by your phone manufacturer. </p>
<p> HYE I AM WITH XFJVA ROOTED STOCK ROM IF I UODATE WITH THIS WILL BE THE BATTERY IMPROVEMENTS????? </p>

<p> How to Calibrate Android Phone Battery after flashing a New ROM </p>
<p> Smartphones are provided with rechargeable batteries which are included in the handset itself. Most of the handset provides complete one day or three days battery life which depends on kind of material used inside it. The Android OS by Google consumes more battery because its designed to continuous synchronize the date though there are steps by which you can optimize the battery life of your cell phone. </p>
<p> For the users who like to try out new ROMs very often or by default Android receives updates to Android very often. These updates re constantly pushed to the users to provide the better experience to the users. For those who flash their mobile handset with custom ROM they are advised to charge their handset to 100 % battery life and then proceed with the upgrade processor. That is advised because if you have 50 % of battery life and proceed with firmware update, the new custom ROM will consider 50 % battery life as the full battery stats and this will provide half the battery life then earlier as specified by your phone manufacturer. In those cases you need to go with the battery calibration to gain 100 % battery backup as specified by your provider. There is complete procedure on how you will calibrate your phone battery is mentioned by us and if you would like to make the process very much easier then you can make use of a specially designed application which calibrates your battery. </p>
<p> Battery Calibration is an interesting application available for download on your Android phone. If you think that your phone battery is miscalibrated then with this application on your phone you can recalibrated it to provider longer battery backup life. In most cases battery calibration should be done when you flash with a new ROM but with this application you can do it any time when you think your battery is miscalibrated. </p>
<p> This application will calibrate your phone battery smartly by removing the batterystats.bin system file and thereby generating a freshly new batterystats file soon and therefore any fake information from the previous firmware is removed. Again here you should make sure that you charges your phone to 100 % battery and then hit the calibrate option provided by this application. Also its suggested that you should complete discharge your battery one the calibration is done and then charge it again to get the better results. Also your phone should be rooted or else this application will not work out on your phone or tablet. There is the option of beep when you reach 100 % battery life. </p>
<p> Once you are ready with rooting then you can calibrate your battery in simple four steps – </p>
<p> Plugin your charger to the phone </p>
<p> Wait until it charges to 100 % </p>
<p> Click the option of ‘Battery Calibrate’ </p>
<p> Now unplug your phone </p>
<p> Battery Calibration Download </p>
<p> The Battery Calibration Android application can be downloaded from Android Apps Labs for free. From your mobile phone, go to your default browser and hit Android Apps Labs search for Battery Calibration and then click on Install to proceed with the installation. Your phone will install the app but you should have your phone rooted to proceed with battery calibration. </p>
<p> Final Verdict </p>
<p> If you think that after ROM upgrade battery life has decreased considerably then you can consider this application to fix the solution as the first aid. </p>

<p> This app is logically wrong since editing your batterystats.bin file does nothing to improve or reset battery line. Its just a repository to store info on what was using the battery while power off. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> CallTrack – A Handy App for Storing Call Times </p>
<p> Sure, Android has a call roster built into the phone and Google Voice which also tracks your calls. However, you can be excused for wanting something a little different and easier to use to track when you are making certain calls and to verify the calls you have made. Some of us need a method of storing records of calls made for business purposes or just because we are anal about what our carriers charge us for. Whatever the reason, you can install CallTrack to take care of this for you. CallTrack actually stores details about the calls you have made and received to Google Calender. This is handy as it allows you to back up your calendar data (hence your calls) when you do your back ups so you never lose the data. It is also customisable. Although the level of customisation is not mind blowing – it is enough for what the app needs to do. </p>
<p> You can set the software to log missed calls, incoming calls and outgoing calls. You can also dictate what it actually saves to Google Calendar and enable or disable the app at will. Not bad for a free app and adds a little extra functionality to your Android device that would not have necessarily been as easy to utilise without it. Sometimes we need records of this nature for tax offset purposes. Because we are unable to claim costs that have not been incurred as a direct result of undertaking business – it is a really handy app in this regard. Couple CallTrack with Tracker for extra functionality – you can opt to only track calls made to specific number so that you are only tracking calls that have been made when doing business. This makes it a lot easier to work out what call costs you can actually claim when tax time comes around. </p>
<p> If you are using it for this method and make a great deal of calls it is a good idea to try and organise all of the data you have collected weekly. Doing a weekly collation of the CallTrack and Tracker tracked calls will make your job a little easier come tax time. You should be able to set up a Google Doc to record the data into a spreadsheet (again, Tracker can help with this) in order to completely automate the process. You will need to pull the relevant data out of the Google Calendar and save it into a Google Doc – you might need to manually input the cost of the call when the bill hits you as well. Alternatively you can get an app that actually records the cost of the call when it is done and find a way to store this data with the call. The sky is the limit in regards to Android apps and you are really only limited by the amount of time you spend in customising your work flow around the apps you have at your disposal. When it comes to tax (in this regard) – the less you pay the better. </p>

<p> The LED flash and digital zoom options are included in the high end smartphones which are talk of the town. The mid range models mostly doesn’t come with LED flash which provides better camera quality. Taking pictures especially in low light conditions and during the night time does come with difference in quality as compared during the day light with the same camera. To improvise the overall quality of photos during the night, the night mode and LED flashes have been incorporated for various handsets by the manufacturers itself. However, most of the mid range handsets doesn’t have LED flash and to obtain good results we are using Night Vision Camera application. </p>
<p> The Night Vision Camera uses phone camera capabilities to provide better pictures and has a clever algorithm to provide better brightness additionally. Additionally it has a turn green filter ON/OFF and the default itself is a green filter. The quality of the photos depends on your camera largely and Galaxy S or S II or HTC Wildfire S provides better camera quality. When the application is running the camera seems to get slower and you need to hold the camera as steady as possible. </p>
<p> When you open the camera application, press the << button as seen on your screen and you get the options of menu. </p>

<p> How to Capture Screenshot on Samsung Galaxy S5 (2 Methods) </p>
<p> We had done the explanation with the earlier flagship devices for the most simple techniques, and the same cannot be missed out for the Samsung Galaxy S5, which has more than the simple ways to get things done. For example, if you wanted to capture a screenshot on the Galaxy S5, there is more than one way for it, and it depends on how you wanted to do it. </p>
<p> For those who have earlier used any Samsung Galaxy phone, it won’t be any different for them as its the same physical keys to be used if you wanted to capture a screenshot on the S5 too, but if you are bored or have a situation where the pressing of buttons cannot be done, there is another way to capture the screenshot. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S5 Screenshot with Physical keys: The keys you need to press here, are the power key along with the home key, both at the same time to take the screenshot. This would become easier when you have both the hands free because the buttons aren’t that close for a single hand to press them together. </p>
<p> You just need to be ready on the particular page you wanted to capture </p>
<p> Press the home and power buttons together </p>
<p> You will hear the camera click sound and in a couple of seconds, there would be a message on the screen saying “Copied to clipboard” </p>
<p> In the notification panel, there would be a message saying “Screenshot captured” with the preview of the screenshot, and direct options for the users to edit, delete or share the screenshot </p>
<p> This way of capturing the screenshot is the default one which is seen in most of the Android ICS and later devices, and the physical key combination changes based on the brand. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S5 Screenshot with Swipe Gesture: For those who wanted something different from the physical key combination for the screenshot, here’s a way. This is one of the gestures which the phone has in its list, and a swipe of your palm on the screen would capture the screen for you. </p>
<p> To set this up, you need to go Settings > Motion > Motions and Gestures > Palm swipe to capture </p>
<p> Going into that section, you can toggle it on / off. You just have to swipe from one corner of the screen to the other, irrespective of the side. You need to make sure that the entire side (with the little finger facing the screen) is touching the screen before you swipe it. </p>
<p> The captured screenshot take a place in the File System under the Pictures folder, and in the Gallery, there is a separate folder created for the Screenshots. </p>
<p> These are pretty easy ways for capturing the screenshot on the Samsung Galaxy S5, and the physical method might be very well known to most of the users, but it does come handy to those who are shifting from some other smartphone to the Galaxy S5. </p>

<p> How to Change and Customize Front Touch Buttons on LG G Pro 2 </p>
<p> Customization is what we love Android for, and when the smartphones themselves come with little possibility for customization in the interface, it’s quite disappointing. That is not the case though, with the LG G Pro 2 which has a lot of options to make the interface better and easier to use based on the user’s need. One of the most commonly used areas in any smartphone is the buttons, and the ones in the bottom below the display are quite important and commonly used. </p>
<p> Usually for most of the LG Android phones, there are three buttons which are usually the fixed ones with options for Home, Back and Menu but in the LG G Pro 2 (just like it was in the LG G2), the front touch buttons are changeable, and you can change the position as well as the actual buttons where an addition to the standard three buttons is possible, taking it to a maximum of five buttons below the display. </p>
<p> To change the front touch buttons in the LG G Pro 2, you need to go: Settings > Display > Home & Lock > Front touch buttons </p>
<p> Here, you would be able to see the options, which are explained as below. </p>
<p> Button combination – Here’s where you can change all the combinations for buttons. You need to touch and drag the icon rearrange it or place it in the icon tray if it isn’t already. The three that come by default, are Home, Menu and Back buttons which cannot be removed but can be rearranged in the tray. The extra ones that we see are – Recent Apps, QSlide, Notifications and QuickMemo. </p>
<p> There is a total of 5 icons which you can use at maximum in the icon tray, and you can choose to have them at any order you want. </p>
<p> Color – The color of the tray icon can be changed, and the user can choose between White, White Gradation, Black and Black Gradation. </p>
<p> Transparent background – The front touch buttons tray is usually opaque and keeps its own color in every section, even the home screen. You can choose to have that transparent on the home screen. </p>
<p> This is a very handy option for someone who wanted to have the buttons in a combination which was in their previous phone, where a few devices come with the Back key on the right side (for example, Samsung Galaxy phones). </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> How to Change Default Ringtons, Sound Notifications, Alarm Tone on Android Devices </p>
<p> One of the best reasons why I love Android devices is that it’s an open source operating system. So what does an open source allows users to do? Ideally an open source program designed for free rights for development by any one. Since my Android is open for development, I love to customize and personalize it accordingly to the best of my knowledge that I possess in development and coding. </p>
<p> Everyone loves to change the ringtones and sounds on their mobile phone and there are tons of options in Android devices itself. Every Android powered smartphones has the ability to change the default ringtones, notifications, screen lock sounds and lot more. So when you like to wake up with the most romantic Titanic song or would like to change the message notifications and email notifications. </p>
<p> First thing, let me tell you that you have many traditional ways of finding ringtones on your device. With Android on your hand, one would obviously think of Android Play Store, which was previously the Android Market. So go to Android Market, search for ringtones and you will get thousands of results. You can filter out the results accordingly to suit your requirements but you can find better filtered results by tailoring down your exact requirements in the keyword that you have searched. Try searching out for the keyword romantic ringtones, you will find many of the ringtones that you love. Well that was all about how would you get ringtones from the web or the other sources, we will now go through on how can you save those ringtones and apply them as your Gmail notification alert, message ringtone and personalized ringtones for each users. </p>
<p> Choosing Default Ringtones on Android </p>
<p> If you have an Android smartphone, regardless of the version included or the regardless of the manufacturer, the following are the settings where you can change the ringtone – </p>
<p> From your mobile phone, go to Menu > Settings > Sound. </p>
<p> In the Sound area you will find Phone ringtone and notification ringtones. When you tap on each of them you will get a list of pre-installed ringtones on your mobile phone. These ringtones comes by factory default and they are same on all the Android smartphones. When you are making selections when you press on a ringtone it will automatically be played. It’s really good that we are determined what kind of sound it has before selecting another one and this make us to choose right ringtone. </p>
<p> This is how the notification tone selection looks like – </p>
<p> Once you have chosen up with your notification sound, tap on OK and it will be applied. </p>
<p> That how you can change the default ringtone on your Android phone. </p>
<p> Changing Alarm Tone </p>
<p> The alarm tone which is set by default on any Android phone is really annoying and I would not love to wake up with those notifications. And here the procedure on how you will change it – </p>
<p> Go to Clock on your mobile phone and it will automatically take you to Alarm. </p>
<p> This is how the Alarm option will look like for you – </p>
<p> When you have an alarm set on your phone, tap on that Alarm and you will be under its settings. </p>
<p> Now navigate to Alarm tone and tap on it. Once you do that you will be get the option to select for the alarm tone, browse for the sound or go to your my files folder. Browse through the folder and select the tone which you want to apply as the ringtone. When you have selected any one tap on OK button to apply it. </p>
<p> You can also have control on the sound of the notification alarm as well, this option is just located above the alarm tone. </p>
<p> Change Message Notification </p>
<p> So when have gone through most of the sound notifications and now we head to change the message and email notifications, follow the procedure below – </p>
<p> Open the Message folder and then tap the Menu button. </p>
<p> Now tap on the Settings option. </p>
<p> Scroll down till the end and you will find the option of notifications and select ringtone under notifications settings. </p>
<p> The notification has the option of tap to ON or disable but the select ringtone allows users to change the ringtone of your message notification. Tap on it and then select the ringtone you like. When you are done tap on OK to apply it. </p>
<p> Applying Normal Song as Ringtone </p>
<p> When you want to apply a song which are you playing or you have in your folder of your SD card, you can set it as the ringtone or the personalized ringtone for a contact. </p>
<p> When you are playing a music on the music player of your phone, tap on the Menu button and you will find various options. Select the option of Set as. </p>
<p> Now you have the three options of Phone ringtone or Caller ringtone or Alarm tone. I guess I needn’t explain you more with these three terms. </p>
<p> When I tap on caller ringtone, it will directly take me to the contacts folder asking me to select the contact for whom I want apply this as the caller ringtone. Tap on the contact and the select tone would be applied as the caller ringtone to that contact within no time and you will be taken back to the music player. </p>
<p> So next time when that contact calls you, you will hear the personalized ringtone for that contact. </p>
<p> While going through all the settings above you would noticed that unlike other phones which accepts only mp3 or mp4 as the ringtone, Android doesn’t have any such issues during selections and this is one of the reason I love Android OS on my smartphone. I hope now you will have complete knowledge on managing the sound on your Android phone. </p>

<p> Zihao, Just for the Alarm. Every time I create a new Alarm (either by using Google Voice or directly through S3 software) these settings are default: Alarm type: Melody (I’d like to change it to Vib. & Mel.) Level: MAX (I’d like to change it to medium) Alarm tone: Beep Once (I’d like to change it to …) Snooze: off (I’d like to change it to on) </p>
<p> Again, please don’t recommend 1) download of another application 2) change it every time (I already do this) 3) access the script code and put in new code etc. </p>
<p> I’d consider myself reasonable good with technology, but extremely disappointed that I don’t find a easy solution for this. Samsung generally seems to be smart about these things. </p>
<p> So in other words you are unable to change the default ringtone of your notification sound other then the ones given to us by the factory default ones? </p>

<p> The LG G Pro 2 comes with all the options for changing the font type and size to make it better for the eyes to view, especially while reading the messages. While the other smartphones come with limited number of options for the fonts and many don’t have the option to customize it at all, we like the way LG has included all options for the users to make the interface look better with a few font types and the different sizes to select from. </p>
<p> Change Font Type and Size in LG G Pro 2 </p>
<p> To change the font type and size, you need to do the following: Go to Settings > Display > Font > and under that you would be seeing the two sections – Font type, Font size. </p>
<p> There are a few font types available in the LG G Pro 2 by default, one of which can be selected. The fonts that are available in the list: Roboto, SmartGothic, Travel, Foxrain, Coffee, Purewhite, Serif of which one cannot be compared with the other, for the reason that none of them looks even a bit similar. Select one of them if you don’t like the default Gothic font. </p>
<p> For changing the Font size, you will see the option just below the font type, and there are a few options for the same – Minimum, Small, Medium, Large, Very large, Maximum. The default one that is set, is Medium but you can set any size based on how you want to view. </p>
<p> How to download fonts on your LG G Pro 2 </p>
<p> Downloading the fonts is possible too, if someone isn’t happy with the fonts available already in the device. In the same options area for changing the font type, you will see the option “Add fonts”. Tap on that and you would be taken to the LG SmartWorld where you need to register an account before you are able to access the big directory of fonts from where you can download any font you like. Install the font and you would see that listed in the list of fonts to select from. </p>
<p> This is something good from LG G Pro 2 for allowing the users to change the font and customize the way the text looks in the device, making the personalization even better. </p>

<p> How to Change Input Languages – Android Keypad Settings while sending SMS </p>
<p> It’s good to see that you can send SMS in your native language. Apart from English, you can send SMS in Dutch, Chinese, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Bengali, Russian, Arabic, Mandarin, Mexican English and a long list of languages are supported. Spanish is spoken by 15 % of the overall people in United States and Mandarian is the top spoken language in the world surpassing English. Those facts clearly means that people are not just based on the world’s common language but have diversified languages. The Android platform has been developed keeping this in mind and this should make consumers happy. </p>
<p> Multiple language supports in messages were included from the Android 2.2 Froyo update along with many major exciting features for users. Users can add multiple languages for the Android keyboard and then switch from multiple languages through settings. When you set a language it will change the keys and then auto suggest dictionary. </p>
<p> Changing Message Input Language in Android </p>
<p> In Android phone you can type a message in your preferred language. Here is how you can select the languages to type your message – </p>
<p> Just go to Messages and then tap on ‘Create a New Message‘. </p>
<p> Come to the message body and then tap on Settings tab. </p>
<p> You will be then presented with keypad settings wherein you need to tap on to ‘Input Language‘. </p>
<p> Here you will be provided with a list of language supported and untick or tick the languages that you desire to choose while composing SMS. </p>
<p> When you are done click on OK. </p>
<p> Come back to the compose section of the message and enjoy SMS in your preferred language. </p>
<p> Don’t try this on Android 2.1 Eclair platform as it will not work on those phones. </p>

<p> (Changelog) Details of 7,454 Changes Between 4.4.2 (KOT49H) & 4.4.3 (KTU84L) </p>
<p> Google seems to have gone crazy when it comes to releasing an all new update dubbed as Kitkat 4.4.3 Android OS which ropes in thousands of changes. With over 7,450+ changes, Google has seriously created issues w.r.t the developers as back support is not provided for most of the native functionalities. If we take an example of native player for music streaming, Google has done something in the code which affects HLS streaming adversely in the Kitkat 4.4.3. While this is one of the use case where developers are facing issues, there are tons of other issues which are otherwise reported by developers at AOSP (Android Open Source Project). </p>
<p> While the Bug list is huge, the only silver lining is that Google have offered is that it had fixed most of the issues at the user level. With a new re designed dialer app along with the Chromium built in browser along with the ART, Dalvik, numerous apps, and so much more. The best part is that you no longer have to worry about losing Bluetooth functionality from overexposure to BLE devices (aefcb18) or some of the other less specific Bluetooth issues, popping sounds in flac audio files (9aad9a2), semi-permanent death of background services (c174288), or bad VPN routing (797ec70). </p>
<p> In this latest version of Kitkat 4.4.3 Android OS, Google has released fix for the low volume on the wired headsets. While we have no clue on whether this had been addressed in the Nexus 5 or not but this update also fixes the 5GHz WiFi connection issue. With more than 70,000 words, the change log which contains near about 7450+ entries, you can refer to the complete change log of Kitkat 4.4.3 Android OS which is very useful for the android developer community. </p>
<p> Do let us know in the comments section just in case if you face any issues or have any feedback about the new update of Kitkat 4.4.3 in the comments section below. </p>

Anyways shifting the gears to Android smartphones, in this article we will show you on how you can change the message centre number. </p>
<p> If you are among those users who are unable to send or receive SMS on your phone, then you might have messed up with your messages settings. I am you would be try out your best to resolve the issues but the issue could be of your message centre number being not correct one. If some has messed up the message centre number, then you wouldn’t be able to receive or send any messages through your mobile phone. The message centre number is the attribute of your network provider and whatever messages that you sent are been routed by that message centre number and it acts as a gateway. This number is certainly required for routing the SMS from your network. </p>
<p> Modify Message Centre Number </p>
<p> To modify message centre number to the correct one ensure the following steps to be followed. </p>
<p> Call customer care and ask them the correct message centre number. You have to manually edit it. </p>
<p> Launch SMS application on your phone. </p>
<p> Now tap on Menu and go to Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll down and select the ‘Message Centre’. </p>
<p> As soon as you open that you will be provided to edit the message centre number. Set it to the correct one and then tap on OK button. </p>
<p> Now have a go with a SMS or two and see whether they are been received at the sender end. You can make sure whether it’s delivered or not by selecting delivery reports ON. If you are still unable to sent, then restore your messages settings to default. </p>
<p> That’s done. </p>
<p> Android is a great operating system and the procedure is same whether you have Galaxy Note or Galaxy S II or HTC Chacha or Huawei Ascend P and its regardless of the Android version that you have on your mobile phone. </p>

<p> Charge Galaxy Nexus Faster by Force AC Fast with Kernel Patch </p>
<p> Battery Charge for Android phones is always an issue and all thanks to developers who are here with a workaround for all the Samsung Galaxy Nexus users after applying which you will be able to increase the battery life of the device marginally and also not just that, the device will charge faster than ever. Please note that this trick is not officially recommended by Samsung or Google but it’s just third party developers who have come up with this work around. There is no harm what so ever for performing this step. But wait for this to be possible, Developers first need to add the kernel which we will be providing in the due course of this article. All the batteries generally charges from 0 – 70% but unfortunately due to many reasons on related to the software or firmware files the battery charging time becomes very high. </p>
<p> Basically the kernel which we will be checking out allows you to toggle the fast charge. This also works for MHL, HOWEVER you will most likely still be limited by the MHL adapter itself. With modification to the MHL adapter (splice in an additional charger) plus this mod, bunklung was able to charge at ~600-700 mA while mirroring and streaming. Please note that there will be a force close error once when the charge is toggled. Please note that as of now there is no flashable zip file for the normal users or any direct patch installation file. Though there are many techniques for increasing the efficiency like custom ROM firmwares etc. which we will see more in the coming days to come. </p>
<p> If you do end up running a kernel with this patch applied, there is an application you still have to use to enable the Force AC charging called Incredicontrol. For more details on the development you can visit the Source link mentioned at the end of this article. So, if you are a developer, we hope that you will make use of this kernel for normal consumers and just in case if you are a consumer then we will surely keep an eye on this story and as in when it arrives we will surely come up with a detailed article. We just hope that this technique will also be extended to other Android smartphones as well. Do share with us in the comments section just in case if you face any issues as we will be more than happy to help you out. You can also alternatively refer to the battery saving tips which we have covered on AndroidAdvices so that you can make the most out of your batteries. </p>

<p> Cheapcast App Streams from any Android Phone / Tablet without Chromecast </p>
<p> Chromecast from Google came in as one of the easiest and best streaming dongles, but for that you would have to pay and purchase the dongle and carry it along. But right now, there’s an app called Cheapcast that is available through Play Store, which tries to emulate the Chromecast dongle, and make the device work like a target for the applications which are enabled with Chromecast, and the apps include Youtube, Google Music etc. </p>
<p> There’s nothing to take away from, or criticize about the Chromecast because it does the job pretty well but there are several users who could not find a good reason to spend money on purchasing the dongle, and many who missed out on buying it and the dongle got sold off. For them, the Cheapcast app can do a similar job without asking them for a penny. </p>
<p> For the Cheapcast to stream the content, both the sender and receiver device has to be on the same Wi-Fi network, and if at all the receiver is a small screen device, you could connect it to either a TV or large screen monitor through the HDMI port and get the streaming done. </p>
<p> Do bear with the errors if you find them while trying the app, because right now it is still in the early Beta version, but that shouldn’t stop you from trying out the app. Once you install the Cheapcast app on both the devices, you need to enable it and then, on the Sender’s device, open Youtube and you would see a message saying that you need to click on the “Icon” to stream the content. While playing the video, you can select the icon and then select the device on which you wanted to stream this one. </p>
<p> The Cheapcast app would show only the devices which are having the Cheapcast enabled, and are located on the same WiFi network. </p>
<p> It could be the TV, tablet device or another smartphone which can install the Cheapcast and act as a receiver. And as said above, you can just take another smartphone and connect it to the TV using an HDMI port and make the streaming even better, sending the content to the larger screen. </p>
<p> * For the Chromecast owners, you may look out for the Mycast App which is still in the process of development, and which could enhance the functionality of the Chromecast, assisting in playing the videos from the cloud and local storage. </p>

<p> Cheapest Android Tablets in India Launched by LACS </p>
<p> What do you think would be the cheap price that you can get an Android tablet? Of course the India government showed us a limelight into $ 35 tablet but until now they have produced any real product. For a long time Olive Telecom’s OlivePad was the cheapest Android tablet priced at Rs 18000 in India. But few weeks back the Reliance 3G tab broke the record by becoming the cheapest available tablet priced at Rs 12,999. After Reliance, Beetel soon followed the trend and they launched Beetel Magiq tablet priced at Rs 9999. </p>
<p> We have the news that a Bangalore based company name LACS (Lakshmi Access Communication Systems) become the latest player in the Indian market to get budget tablet PCs. It has launched various tablets which come in 7 inches, 8 inches and 10 inches screen sizes. The good thing about those tablets is that they are cheaply available price starting at Rs 6,250. </p>
<p> Though the official site of the company lacs.co.in is under maintenance and shows only picture of the tablet. They have altogether launched twelve tablets which comes in four different product series namely Pepper, Tamarind, Mirchi and Paprika. These four series has got 3 tablets models under each. </p>
<p> Pepper Series </p>
<p> The tablets available in this series are Pepper M74, Pepper M84v and Pepper 108i. </p>
<p> The Pepper M74V is an Android Froyo 2.2 based tablet with 7 inches LCD sensitive touch display (maybe a kind of resistive touchscreen) at an 800 x 480 screen resolution. It has 800 Mhz processor and we have little information on its features. The tablet supports Ethernet LAN, Wi-Fi and USB 2.0. With just a front camera, 3 G compatible dongle and support of micro SD card slot along with 3.5 mm stereo headset jack make this tablet worth affordable. </p>
<p> It also comes with micro SD card support up to 32 GB, built-in 2 GB memory and G Sensors. It is the base model and it’s priced at Rs 6, 250. Other two models in this series are Pepper M84V and Pepper 108i have similar specifications but the only difference comes in the display sizes and the presence of HDMI and GPS. </p>
<p> Paprika Series </p>
<p> The tablets available in this series are Paprika 78S, Paprika M88A and Paprika M19/M10. </p>
<p> The Paprika 78S is the base tablet under this series and it has got 7 inches capacitive touch screen with 800 x 480 resolution. This tablet is Wi-Fi enable and supports HDMI connectivity. It also supports USB Host 2.0 and USB device 2.0. You can add 32 GB of memory to this tablet using the standard micro SD card slot provided and 3.5 mm headset jack takes the entertainment to next level. The tablet comes with 3G compatible dongle, front camera and built-in 4 GB of internal memory. Just like Pepper series, the tablet gets Android Froyo operating system. </p>
<p> The other two models Paprika M88A and Paprika M19/M10 have same specifications expect the screen size varies. </p>
<p> Tamarind Series </p>
<p> The tablets available in this series are Tamarind M733, Tamarind M833 and Tamarind M188. </p>
<p> The base version Tamarind M733 has 7 inches capacitive touch screen with ultra slim body. It’s a Wi-Fi enable devices which supports HDMI, USB Host 2.0 and supports micro SD card with a maximum storage of 32 GB. The tablet comes with 3G compatible dongle, 3.5 mm headset jack and front VGA camera along with 8 GB of internal memory. There is no change in Android version and continues with Android Froyo. </p>
<p> The other two versions in this series Tamarind M833 and Tamarind M188 have got the same specifications apart from the display screen size. </p>
<p> Lakshmi Access Communication Systems is planning to open their outlets around various cities and towns to sell these devices with brand name as ‘easyEz’. Also, also with the purchase of their tablets, they are offering an upgrade warranty to their customers under whom the users would be able to upgrade to the latest version model by returning the older unit and paying the difference price. </p>
<p> Overall, not sure what magic this tablet would create and moreover Android 2.2 is a smartphone operating system which comes pres installed with this tablets. The price tag attached to this tablet might make an impact. </p>

<p> Check & Adjust TV Projector & Speakers from Android Device with THX Tune-Up </p>
<p> When you order a new TV set for your home, the job really isn’t done there because there is a calibration needed for the television’s features to get the best experience while watching the Blu-ray movies or some colorful content. There are of course a lot of professional services available if you wanted to set things up when you have already invested a lot in purchasing a good kit, but if you are fine enough with the basic adjustments that can be done by yourself, the calibration app from THX could do quite a lot. It’s the THX Tune-up application which would take the users through different video setting calibrations. </p>
<p> The good thing about the app is that you won’t have to sit and wonder how the changes are to be done, because you are taken through the steps in a sequence, and for each of it, there is an automated dialog box which would take you through the various settings and guide you on how to adjust the things. Even better, these instructions would be based on the TV make and thus you will have all the steps for the specific TV you purchased. </p>
<p> What adjustments can be made with THX Tune-up app? </p>
<p> TV color, brightness and other settings </p>
<p> Projector setup </p>
<p> Speaker / Home theater system settings </p>
<p> The video adjustments that are possible with the THX Tune-up app, are as below: </p>
<p> Aspect ratio – There are different aspect ratios depending on the TV screen size, and whether it is a normal or wide-screen TV. The app would ensure that the TV displays the shape and size correctly </p>
<p> Brightness – The app ensures that the shadow details and the night scenes are clearly visible, and the brightness is set at a level which doesn’t hurt your eyes </p>
<p> Contrast – The app adjusts the white details on the television </p>
<p> Color – There are adjustments done to the color so that they are bright and vibrant, but do not look cartoonish </p>
<p> Tint – The skin tone is made to look natural and not too green or red </p>
<p> The audio adjustments possible are: </p>
<p> Speaker assignment – The app confirms whether the speakers are properly connected to the correct AVR outputs (which many of us fail to do so) </p>
<p> Speaker phase – The app confirms whether the speakers are connected in a phase correctly </p>
<p> How is the video adjustment done? It’s simple – most of the job is done by the app, but it would need your Android device’s rear camera to set the color and tint, and there is a special built-in color filter in the app which does that. </p>
<p> For now, the usage is limited and only a few Android devices can install this app. This is the list given below (all these devices should be running Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean or later): </p>
<p> Although we know this is not the perfect professional solution if you were looking to adjust everything for a high-end home entertainment system, this app would do everything basic whenever you might have changed the settings or adjustments for some specific purposes. There are a few more features included too, along with the given above adjustments, and this includes – Playing the exclusive THX trailers to show off the newly tuned system, and to even check how things are adjusted Playing the THX Deep Note in 5.1 surround system to show off the audio system and playing capabilities </p>

<p> Check if your Android Phone is Heartbleed Affected [Security Vulnerability Detector] </p>
<p> Calling yourself an active Internet user? you might not be one if you haven’t heard about the latest bug in the Internet security, called Heartbleed. We talked a lot about Heartbleed here, but if you aren’t sure what this is all about, do check that article to understand it better, and keep yourself safe from compromising your account data. </p>
<p> In short, Heartbleed is a bug in the OpenSSL security which was giving access to the hackers because there was an issue with the secret keys which get compromised and available to the hackers, and these secret keys are what would encrypt the traffic, including the names and passwords and all the personal content of the users. </p>
<p> The research team which found this major bug, did make a tool available for the users to check and understand whether a particular website is affected by the bug or not. But this issue isn’t limited to just the Internet, but is also seen on the devices which are using particular versions of the OpenSSL security for the authentication and security of the devices. There were some suggestions from the security firms that staying offline and not playing around with your online accounts would be a safe option for now, but you can’t stay away from your Android device for long, right? Here’s an app which would at least tell you if your phone has the security version which is affected by the Heartbleed bug. </p>
<p> Heartbleed Detector is an app available for the Android devices, to check if the version of OpenSSL in your device is affected by the Heartbleed bug. There is a certain behavior which if enabled, could lead to a problem to the security of the device and that too is checked by the app. </p>
<p> The app doesn’t do anything else than that, and it doesn’t check the individual apps for finding about the vulnerability, but you at least would get an idea whether the phone has a security version running which is at risk. And for now, there is no fix to this and if your device is running that version of OpenSSL, you need to ensure that the risky function is not turned on. </p>
<p> Download Heartbleed Detector for Android from Google Play Store – Link. </p>

Its gives the cellphone owners the privilege to attain root access within the Android Linux subsystem, this is quite similar to jailbreak on Apple devices. </p>
<p> The root in required when you want to install the custom versions of Android system or the latest firmware updates released by Android. The rooting of a device is officially legal and it can run unauthorized third-party applications easily. </p>
<p> Here is the simple process on how to check whether your device is rooted or not. </p>
<p> You need to open the Android Market and search out for the terminal client. A huge list I got when I searched out for terminal client. The one which I recommend you is Connectbot. </p>
<p> Now open the Connectbot and read through the instructions carefully and you would be able to faced with a text entry prompt. If you are prompted with pound sign (#) then your device is routed and if you see the dollar sign ($) then your device is not routed. However you can easily setup rooting at this instance itself.Try to enter the command “su” without quote. When you have done that you would see a dialog seeking for the permissions from SuperUser app, which you need to grant. If the prompt changes to the pound sign then you are rooted. </p>
<p> That was simple. Do check out our guide on Android Rooting of different devices. </p>

<p> Earlier: Oct 5th 2013 by Pradeep Neela Google outs a Star! Yes, you have read it correctly, Google Inc. has finally released the much hyped “Chromecast” which allows users to project the digital content from your phone / tablet or from your Computer right to your HDMI based devices like Television Screens.

<p> Add the product in your cart and then try to check out, that’s when you can find the status if it ships or not. </p>
<p> Q – Cast everything which is on your mobile screen pictures,videos,games etc or only select video apps? Youtube,Googlemovies.. Ans – ?? </p>
<p> Requirements says that you need a “Wi-Fi enabled supported device”. Does it mean TV has to be Wi-Fi enabled? </p>
<p> If TV already has Wi-Fi capability, then it is already a smart TV. </p>
<p> Can somebody explain to me what this requirement exactly mean? </p>
<p> What it means is that your device that you will transmit the movie from and to the Chromecast must have WiFi capabilities. Which most smartphone, Tablets do have. From my understanding the Chromecast is basically a Wifi receiver that plugs into you HDMI socket. Therefore eliminating HDMI cable. Well worth buying, believe me. Hope this helps out. </p>
<p> Hi, I have a Wi-Fi based router from TWC. I’m not sure I understand the other parameter needed for this device to work. All of my TV’s are HD digital, no analogs. Does that mean I can use this? We have 2 smart TV’s from LG, but I’d like to use this in another room that is not a smart TV. It is a digital and has USB ports. Thanking you for your time. Cheryl </p>
<p> The TV need to have a HDMI (in) port. You will connect the Google stick directly to the HDMI port of your TV. The connector you see on the Google stick is not USB but is HDMI. </p>
<p> Cheryl, as long as you have a TV with an HDMI conector and a compatible Android or Iphone or tablet, you are ready for the ChromeCast. </p>
<p> 1. Laptop/smartphone/tablet with wi-fi (that is what they called “wifi enabled device”); 2. TV device with HDMI in; 3. Chromecast (you will connect your chromecast to HDMI in of your TV); 4. Wi-fi router </p>
<p> How it looks like? A) The signal from your laptop/tablet/phone is “flying” through air to your wifi router. B) signal from A) is continuing from router to chromecast (again through/via air). C) signal from B) is passing through Chromecast “directly” to TV (via HDMI in of TV). </p>
<p> Or, using another words: insted of connecting your laptops/smart phone/tablet to TV with HDMI cable, you will make this connection to your TV via air. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Cloud Computing and Your Android Device </p>
<p> Android devices are perfect for cloud computing – in fact it is something that has been kept in mind during the development of the Android operating system. Your Android device already backs up a good portion of your data automatically to your SD card (possibly without you being aware of it) but there are a few odds and ends you will want to update manually. You can actually update your data to a cloud without too much trouble; even the data you might not be aware that you should be updating such as your saved text messages and app data that is required to save the settings for your downloaded apps. </p>
<p> If you have already rooted your Android device then you can install the CyanogenMod and it will back everything up for you. You can use this with Tasker to do the process automatically daily, weekly or monthly as well. If you haven’t rooted your Android then you will have to format the system and will end up losing everything just to install the mod. Alternatively you can use the Astro File Manager – however not all apps allow this app to access the data that they store for back up purposes. You might just opt to dump everything that you can from your phone’s memory onto an SD card and cataloguing the data on your computer – however this is a pretty sloppy and manual way to do it. </p>
<p> I have read a lot about Titanium Backup for rooted phones as well. It is actually a pretty good tool, but again, if your phone is not rooted you will need to destroy all of the data on the phone in order to root and install this app. So it gets a little tricky. Even if you just manually drag all of the available data off the phone for cataloguing you are going to have a hard time working out what is what and you are likely to spend time working out what is system files and what is user generated data. Of course you can just email all of your text messages to your Gmail or email account for storage offline – although then you have to back up your emails as well. You should have a system in place for doing this anyway and if you do it is not really much of a hassle to back up everything at once from your email account. </p>
<p> So it is actually an interesting thing to consider. Adding to the cloud in order to back up pertinent Android phone related data may not seem like a secure method of backing data up – however, it is no worse than just dumping it onto your computer. You can actually opt to encrypt your back ups (and there are a few encryption apps out there for the Android). You might be able to combine Tasker with an encryption program in order to automate the whole process. You will probably have to do some research on how to best do this – and if you do find a way of doing it, share how you do it for the benefit of all Android users! </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Combine Multiple Photos on Android & Share as Photostrips </p>
<p> When you have several photos is quite annoying to email all those and attach them. If you are at an event or at a party then you can easily sharing the photos quickly if you upload photos in batches as the individual upload will kill all your time. The Clarklab has recently launch an easy to use photo app with no nonsense user interface in the Android Market and that is free for a limit time usage period. With 10,000 downloads within a week of its launch, the Photobooth is heading to be favorite and the most rated photo apps in the Android Marketplace soon. </p>
<p> What the Photobooth does is to combine the photos from the gallery or the camera into single file so as to allow sharing of them in much easy ways with just few clicks on the go. Users can create custom photo strip of which photos are imported from gallery or camera. </p>
<p> Once the photo selection is done with maximum allowed limit of three photos per photo strip you next choice is to set up the layout among the choice available are the horizontal and vertical layout option. There are more options like order, output size and then finally it comes to how you want to share the photos in the photo strip which you have just made. Just the like the normal sharing on your Android phones, you can share it with your Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, Google+, Gmail with just few clicks. </p>
<p> Combine three photos </p>
<p> Change the layout, order and size </p>
<p> Send photo strip to various services listed </p>
<p> The good thing about Photobooth is that it doesn’t add styles, filters or any effects and doesn’t add any stickers and captions. </p>
<p> Cons </p>
<p> The limitations which I found with this app is that you can only add three photos maximum per photo stream. That is one of the major cons of this application and should have they made it atleast or maximum ten photos per stream that would be have been better because by default you can attach 5 photos at maximum per email through your Android mobile phone. </p>
<p> And this is how the photo stream would look like at the receivers ends </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Connect to USB based System PC Internet Connect with Reverse Tether Android App </p>
<p> The Android phones can be best enjoyed when you are connected to web. Without web your Android phone is just a phone for calls, games and messages. Social network, various applications, widget requires access to internet via anything of 2G, 3G or 4G LTE. In United States data plans are much higher and we know we need internet on our mobile phone and the only possible sources are to get Wi Fi or get a data plan. </p>
<p> If you have a data plan active, you can make use of Wi Fi tethering or Bluetooth tethering to connect your laptop or computer with internet but what if you don’t have internet on your mobile phone and desire to share your laptop connection with your phone? Is it possible? I would say yes its possible, earlier the Connectify software used to do it easily but it’s not working now. Thanks to Reverse Tether Android application which I have just found to do this trick for you. </p>
<p> Reverse Tether an Android application allows you to access your personal computer internet connection on your smartphone using the USB. We have seen so many applications to USB tether your device with the PC but this is the only application in the Android Play Store which does such a thing. </p>
<p> How does Reverse Tether Works? </p>
<p> Reverse Tethering works by simple connecting your phone to the computer using a USB cable. The speed of the internet that you get depends on your mobile phone is almost same as that of what you used and your phone is using the broadband internet hence it will be much faster. </p>
<p> This application is quite useful when – </p>
<p> You don’t have a mobile data plans </p>
<p> When you have a limited data plans </p>
<p> When you need to upgrade via OTA update </p>
<p> If you are in roaming and likes to avoid roaming data charges </p>
<p> If you don’t trust the security or the privacy of your Wi Fi network </p>
<p> If you Wi Fi connection is weak or slow or get disconnected all the time </p>
<p> If you don’t want to visit the burger or bakery just for the sake of internet access </p>
<p> Prefer to get maximum download and upload speed </p>
<p> This application is quite easy but there are few bad thing is that this application requires rooting access on your mobile phone. </p>
<p> As soon as you setup and run this application on to your mobile phone, you would be taken with the set up your phone connection. Tap on Next. This will ask for the USB Connection and if you have connected your phone to the USB then well and fine. </p>
<p> In the next step you will see the tutorial where you see the connection, how to manage it on your computer. Tap on Next. </p>
<p> Now you are ready just tap on Start. </p>
<p> In the next screen, you need to tap on connect as seen on the top right side. It will further ask for the user permissions, give it. </p>
<p> Once you do that you are now connected with an active internet.Note: This application requires your phone to be rooted. </p>
<p> Reverse Tether Android Application Download </p>
<p> Reverse Tether Android application can be easily downloaded from Android Apps Labs for free. To download it directly on to your mobile phone, you need to visit the Android Apps Labs page listing of Reverse Tether application from your phone’s browser and then click on Install to automatically proceed with the installation. </p>

<p> Verdict </p>
<p> Reverse Tether is the only application of its kind and sometime you might need this once while when your PC is not working. The application works great and easy to understand. </p>

<p> Control Your Computer with your Android Device </p>
<p> The Android operating system is full of surprises. The amount of extra functionality that it has access to is astounding. That is why the functionality that allows you to control your computer directly from your phone doesn’t actually come as any real surprise – however, it is awesome nonetheless. You will need to install an app called Gmote in order to do this. The installation is pretty straight forward. If you can install a regular Android app then you will have no problems installing Gmote. It doesn’t give you full access over your computer, however it does allow you to use your Android device as you would a mouse or keyboard. It also allows you to control the playback of media such as movies and music. Pretty nifty really and handy if you have a media center computer but don’t want to worry about hooking up a wireless mouse and keyboard. </p>
<p> To begin with, you are going to need an Android device such as an Android phone or tablet pc. You will then need to install the Gmote server on the computer you wish to control using you Android device and the Gmote client on the Android device. You will also need to know the IP address of the server so that you can remotely connect to the computer via the Android device. Once you have all of this set up you will also need to make sure you have a VLC installed so that you can play any media you need to play – this isn’t really necessary however because you can just control the computer with the Android device as if the Android device is a mouse or keyboard and play the media directly through your selected media player. </p>
<p> Gmote has support for PC, Mac and Linux so it is nice to have a suite of software tools that can be utilised by virtually any platform. It is not the best option for those who want a dedicated media controller for a media center computer. However it is a nice cheap option for the interim if you already have an Android device and some technical knowhow in regards to networking. The latter is not really required because there is a ton of documentation out there on how to set it up. You might also consider saving up for a media center controller after getting it all working once you see the power of controlling a computer with a smaller device. There are pros and cons to using such a device as a remote control method although, the pros certainly outweigh the cons in this instance. </p>
<p> Gmote is just another reason why the Android platform is so powerful. As long as the device operates on an Android platform – you can utilise the Gmote software. Because a large swathe of developers and manufacturers are making devices using Android it shouldn’t be too hard to find a compatible device for the software. However, don’t go out looking for an Android device just to make a remote control for your computer! </p>

<p> How to Convert your Android Device into Mobile Payment Tool </p>
<p> With Google Payment service in place, you might want to know on how you can convert your mobile into a payment service with a service which is brought to you by Card.io. Basically, the card.io service provides the Software developer Kit (SDK) for all the mobile developers out there with which it can accept the credit as well as the debit cards in the form of the mobile applications. Though typing on the mobile phones may be slow and also while many customers doesn’t have an individual hardware setup which will facilitate the swiping of the card right on the mobile phones, but with the help of card.io it has the capability to read the card data just by using the phone’s camera. </p>
<p> Now, with the increasing payment modes and gateways, the biggest concern which is a major concern too is SECURITY of the information. With card.io in place, security will not be a concern at all as this employs one of the most stringent encryption technologies in place which facilitates the 256 bit SSL encryption and also the servers are hosted in the secured facilities. With Google’s NFC based mobiles in place, the Card.io SDK will have to find a way out to garner people’s support. </p>
<p> Highlights of this Payment Solution: </p>
<p> First and the biggest plus of this kind of the mobile payment solution is that it doesn’t require any sort of separate hardware setup and also anyone who has either a credit card or the debit card along with a smart phone is eligible to use or take the benefit of this service. </p>
<p> The approach of this Card.io mobile solution too is different from the one which generally every other payment service provider has. Card.io mainly focuses on the developers who generally builds the mobile applications. </p>
<p> Last but not the least this card.io service offers services with no additional costs as it doesn’t attract any such charges as practically there are no charges per transaction which the card.io has to pay or bears. All you need to do is to choose a provider where you wish to use this service at which is really very flexible as it doesn’t require any sorts of different or new hardware setup configuration. </p>
<p> Though the NFC (Near Field Chip) technology is yet to take off on a fully practical manner as it’s still a concept and soon will be taking off with selective vendors along with the Google which will soft launch the implementation with the update for the Nexus S 4G in the form of the Gingerbread 2.3.5 update after which the NFC functionality will be enabled in all the Nexus S 4G Device. But with the help of card.io innovation, we can only hope that without any hardware support and change, one can easily convert almost every Android device into a mobile payment tool which is the future technology as when it comes to technology, it has to be simple and easy to understand, just like we do at Androidadvices.com. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Convert Videos into Animated GIF Images on your Android Mobile </p>
<p> I always love the GIF files rather than the normal images as it provides the median between image and video. It’s easy to create to create a photo of JPEG or PNG or bit map image format but for making a PNG image is quite tough, you need to open Photoshop and make animated image, for the first time users this is like getting 100 % result without any prior knowledge and many often leaves the job when it comes to Photoshop. </p>
<p> Here comes a new Android application named as GIFDroid which allows users to create GIF Images and the only need it should have is the video input provided by you. The users have control on the output GIF image and here in this article we will show you how this application works. Once you install this application you will first get the notice that this application still is under beta and so report bugs if you find any. This helps developer to report bugs of his early release so that he can improve in the next update. </p>
<p> The home interface of this application has just the three options namely – Select Video, Record Video and View Created GIFs. It’s clearly understood with those options and you have nothing more than those three settings in the home. For better example I have taken a video on my phone from my file storage. </p>
<p> Now then if you have selected a video or recorded a video, in the next page you will be shown with the video in the upper part and the lower part will provide you the option of Edit GIF preferences and finally the option of Next. </p>
<p> Tapping on the Edit GIF Preferences will give you the option of the following – </p>
<p> How many frames per second you want to extract from the video </p>
<p> Delay per second of the GIF Image </p>
<p> Width of the GIF Image </p>
<p> Height of the GIF Image </p>
<p> When you are done with the Edit GIF Preferences settings then you can click on Next and it will take some time to retrieve your video and process with the frames. Now you will present with the frames. You need to select the frames and click on Create GIF to create the GIF image. I have done it here as seen in the photo – </p>
<p> Finally once the GIF image is created you have the option to share, rename, delete the GIF image and create another GIF image from there. </p>
<p> This application is still a lot to go and as of now it has simple and clean interface with clear options to navigate and as all wants it’s free of charge. </p>
<p> The features of using the GIFDroid Android application are as follows – </p>
<p> Convert videos on the go into GIF images </p>
<p> Choose the specific video interval </p>
<p> Adjust preferences such as frames per second, frame delay </p>
<p> Option to adjust the GIF output image dimensions </p>
<p> Choose pre-defined frames to create a perfect GIF image </p>
<p> Share and show your GIF image that you have created </p>
<p> GIFDroid Download </p>
<p> GIFDroid Android Application can be downloaded from Android Apps Labs for free. To download it on your phone, you should open the Android Apps Labs GIFDroid page and then click on the Install button to automatically download this app. </p>

Almost all the ringtones are available in those sites but there might be some audio or video which you want to make it as a customized ringtones. When you want an audio to be customized and used as ringtones its easy but when you have video you should extract audio from it and then proceed with the needful cuttings of the audio frames. </p>
<p> In this article we will go through very simple way to make a ringtone for your phone for the YouTube video which you have liked. </p>
<p> Convert YouTube Video to Mp3 File </p>
<p> As I said you, your primary step is to download the video from YouTube first and then convert it to audio file. As mp3 format is very popular, we will be going through the procedure on how to convert your YouTube video to mp3 file directly and to do so follow the below procedure – </p>
<p> On your PC, you need to browse to YouTube and then choose the video file that you wanted to convert. There is no particular requirement on which video will work, so you can choose any video, I am sure you must be having one in your mind. </p>
<p> After that you need to copy the YouTube video URL and paste it on the site Video2mp3.net, either open in your phone browser on your PC. As the name of this site itself indicates it does the work of converting your video link that you have provided into the output mp3 file. Click on “Convert” to get started. </p>
<p> The process will take that certain amount of time to convert and once it’s done, you will see “Click here to download your converted file” it will then download the mp3 in your hard drive.After then you have the mp3 files, you may want it to cut trim and edit certain segment of your audio to may want to remove. You can make use of Sony Sound Forge or Audacity software’s to edit and trim your YouTube downloaded audio. Audacity in particular is a free open source platform for editing audio files. </p>
<p> Using Mp3 as your Android Ringtone </p>
<p> Once you have finished editing your mp3 file, you are now ready to use that ringtone but to use it on your Android phone, you need to copy it your phone’s SD card storage or the internal memory can also work fine. </p>
<p> Here are the final steps of doing it so – </p>
<p> Connect your phone to your PC </p>
<p> Now create a folder by name ‘ringtone’ in the root of your directory on the SD card. </p>
<p> Copy the YouTube audio that you have created earlier into the ringtone folder of your phone. </p>
<p> Now set your Android phone to be used as mp3 file as its ringtone. Also change the ringtone by going through the Setting tab under the Menu option and then following the Sound Settings. </p>
<p> When you are in the Sound Settings, tap on to ‘Phone ringtone‘ (settings is nearly similar for all the Android phones) and select the ringtone. </p>
<p> That is how you can set your ringtones on your phone. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Create a Firewall on Android Device & Select Apps to Access Internet </p>
<p> With wireless carrier setting up the data limits on your mobile phone and rarely you can find unlimited plans, people are concerned whether they will hit the data limits. Importantly when it’s an Android device where Apps gets update oftently and you need your device synchronized in order to receive mail and other knowing information. </p>
<p> DroidWall is an Android application which allows users to setup restrictions whether they should be granted data network access or not. This application is ideal solution for those who don’t have an unlimited data plans and as you know Android is all about updates of apps, firmware and lot more, it require internet access where ever necessary. One thing that this application will work on if your phone is rooted. </p>
<p> DroidWall works only for rooted phones only. If you don’t have a rooted phone, then get the root first </p>
<p> With Droidwall you can set up data restrictions for access over 3G or 2G and/or access over Wi Fi for each and every applications present on your mobile phone. So setting up limits of app access on 3G or 2G is good idea and granting access on Wi Fi willn’t consume any data on your phone. In turn when you are restricting data access for some phones, the ads are removed on those phones, which is a good thing for the users. </p>
<p> As soon as you install this application on your mobile phone and run it, you will be directly taken to the DroidWall app page. </p>
<p> After you have applied the settings when you exist the application you will be asked to apply the rules and its automatically restore when you restart your device. </p>
<p> From Menu > More there are many other options like clear log, show log, set password and set custom script. Setting up password in particular is good thing on your phone as it will restrict other users of your phone to prevent them on any of the changes done by you. </p>
<p> What Droidwall does is not a simple work but it’s quite useful and I would like to see this application come out with every Android phone by default. This firewall can set data limits and users can avoid higher data limits reaches. Moreover this would enhance Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich OS which provides Data usage details and with DroidWall it would be a complete data control on your phone. </p>

One photo is taken when the shutter button is pressed, while the second comes when you sweep the phone on the upward motion after which the 3D map of every pixel is being created automatically for the initial photo. </p>
<p> This camera app uses the 3D map as the reference point adding the blur effect to the objects which doesn’t fall under the specified plane.

<p> Download CyanogenMod 11 App Screencast Video Recording on Android 4.4.1 Devices </p>
<p> CyanogenMod which is an open source replacement distributor for Smartphones and tablet based on Android mobile Operating system has released an app today, called Screencast (beta) that can record device’s screen running on Android 4.4.1. </p>
<p> CyanogenMod developer Koushik Dutta released this new beta app in the Google Play Store, who is known earlier for developing other utilities like an Allcast app that can stream from Android to Chromecast as well as Apple TV. </p>
<p> This Screencast app helps in capturing video of one’s screen just as taking the screenshots, it can be activate it by holding volume up + power button (combo) on Nexus 5 device as we take screen shots on it by holding volume down + power button. The Screencast mode can be turned off by open the notification bar and tap the “Stop” button. </p>
<p> Koushik Dutta revealed that the app would run in any device rooted with Android 4.4.1 and may have a way for it to operate even on hardware that is not rooted. This app can be run by installing latest CM 11 Nightly if it is available for your device by downloading it from the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Screencast app is complete with voice recording enabling developers wishing to replicate and test bugs while on go. This is definitely easier than any other solution on the market, and so far it seems to be working quite well for Android devices. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Best Ways to Keep Daily Notes & Tasks Organised – To Do List App for Android </p>
<p> When you have loads of stuff to do on daily basis, then it is better you note each of the task some where so that it becomes easier to track and you don’t lose the track. There are at times when you forget a few important things while doing the others, so keeping all of the pending tasks noted down is an easier and better option, and that is where we mention Any.do as one of the best in this category (although Google Keep is a good alternative). Any.do does the job simpler and better, and you don’t have to hit your head hard to understand what all the app does. </p>
<p> Any.do App – How well can this organize your tasks? </p>
<p> There are several widget options available with Any.do and these widgets can be re-sized, and making it cover one of the home screens would make it a very productive one, with a big list of pending tasks shown on the same screen. </p>
<p> Another good advantage under the same, is that you get to see the tasks under categories like “Personal” and “Work” so that you can prioritize them and sort out which one’s to be done first. </p>
<p> The app would organize the tasks based on the time, i.e. today, tomorrow, upcoming and someday (where you write your wishes). It is your wish to choose between this view and the Folder view where it gets divided into Personal and Work. Of course this doesn’t come with any Calendar, so the app would ask you to download it’s own Cal app from the Play Store. For each of the task, there are a few options when you click on it – </p>
<p> Set priority </p>
<p> Do a Google Search </p>
<p> Alert (where the app sets a reminder for a particular date and time) </p>
<p> Notes (add any notes to that particular task to explain it) </p>
<p> Share (here it would give you the option to share the task with the contacts through Android Beam, useful especially for employees in the same office) </p>
<p> The task does motivate you, by saying Well Done when you have no tasks pending for today, or would let you know of the pending ones in the Notification panel. There is an option of the voice input where the Google Voice recognizer would do a pretty decent job in recognizing and converting that to text. </p>
<p> The settings section has some features such as shaking, and you get to choose between the Black and White themes, and there are options to toggle for the Status bar, Post Meeting, Missed call etc. Worried of losing the data if you accidentally swiped and deleted the tasks? there’s an option to backup in the settings, which would save all your current pending tasks and you can restore that any time. </p>
<p> The other good thing about the Any.do app is the big number of languages in which it would work, and there is no limitation for the Voice to text, because that is being done with the Google Voice, thus you can talk in your own language and that too gets saved. </p>
<p> Syncing of the app with the desktop is possible with only the Chrome browser, where an extension is available for the user to install and check out these tasks on their computer. </p>
<p> So overall this is a brilliant app, and we would suggest especially the new Android users to have this app in the device if you wanted a work organizer or task scheduler for your Android phone. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> The Dangers and Power of Simple Root </p>
<p> Simple Root is a program developed to root the HTC Evo 4G. Rooting an Android device essentially unlocks the NAND memory and flash memory in the phone to allow it to be rewritten or tweaked to the user’s preference. However, rooting an Android device does not come without risks. Simple Root is designed to minimise those risks, however there have been reports of some people losing 4G capabilities once using it. A lot of this may come down to the user not know what they were doing when rooting the device. You generally have to reinstall another rom in order to add and enhance functionality after rooting the device. Maybe many of the people who had problems neglected to do this part of the process or were unaware that they had to do this. </p>
<p> Simple Root has a very easy to follow interface. It has a few buttons – labelled ‘Root’, ‘Unlock Nand’ and ‘Flash Recovery’. All pretty straight forward if you know anything about rooting an Android device. It is important to note however that Simple Root is only designed to work with the HTC Evo 4G – so don’t attempt to use it for another Android phone because you might cause untold problems for the Android device. The other problem with using a tool such as this is that it makes the process too easy. Usually, in order to root an Android device you had to specify individual commands and these commands took some research to come up with and learn about. You are essentially cheating yourself out of knowing what you are doing when you are rooting the device. </p>
<p> It is a free download and relatively easy to install and run. However you really need to back up anything you can before doing the rooting process. If you lose something it may take a lot of work (and the kindness of others) to reinstall the original rom that you have wiped while rooting the device. This point can’t be stressed enough – there is no point in bricking a device worth a few hundred to a thousand dollars because you are not sure of what you are doing. So probably more importantly you should do a lot of research on rooting an Android device prior to attempting it. You might be rooting the device for the wrong reasons. There is no point rooting an Android device to give your phone functionality that you can get for a couple of bucks on the AppStore or the Market. </p>
<p> The same applies if you want to root your Android device to install a new interface. If you can get the interface through an add-on or app then you are better off getting it that way then installing a whole new rom for the job. Playing around with Android rooting can be quite dangerous. However, it is also quite powerful if the reasons for doing so are valid. So keep this in mind before going out and using a tool such as Simple Root. </p>

<p> Moto X Sweet Deal ($329 for 16GB) extended through February 22nd: Details </p>
<p> The Sweet Deal on the Moto X is now extended, as Motorola is offering the new pricing of $329 for the 16GB version through February 22nd, if people had missed it out till February 14th, the Valentine’s day. If you still are considering a Motorola phone, this is the one to get right now. </p>
<p> Earlier: Deal: Moto X with $70 (Final Price: $329) Discount through February 14, 2014 – Details That single hour of $100 discount had ended, and now Motorola is still luring the customers with a good $70 discount to the already discounted Moto X smartphone, which would take the final pricing of it to $329. Check out the Moto Maker website for the deal which is live right now, and would be running till the Valentines day, so you have a couple weeks to decide anytime and buy one. </p>
<p> Earlier: There have been several developments from Motorola when you talk about the pricing of the Moto X smartphone. After launching it at a quite high price initially, the company reduced the price to $549.99, and then came the customization options which further put a bigger hole in the pocket, so Motorola decided to reduce the price of Moto X to $399.99 permanently, which was said to be a good deal. But was that still looking good? not for many because the Bamboo customization which everyone were impressed with, had a price tag of $100, making the final price of the device at $499. </p>
<p> Realizing this, Motorola reduced the price of the Bamboo customization to $30, and just before that happened, they had added one more deal – Chromecast free with Moto X purchase. So, they are never out of ideas. Now, the Google Plus page of Motorola Mobility says: </p>
<p> On Monday January 27th, we’re kicking off our Valentine’s Day sale with an extra sweet deal: $100 off any #MotoX without a contract from 3pm-4pm ET. This deal is only available for one hour, while supplies last. If you miss out, don’t worry. You can get $70 off any #MotoX without a contract through Valentine’s Day. </p>
<p> Yes, you got it right. Moto X for $299 is a price someone would not want to miss, if they are seriously looking for a very decent smartphone with the latest software. The $299 pricing is for the 16GB model, and keep in mind that the deal would run for just one hour as said in the update, but if you miss out (either if the deal time is finished, or if the supplies are finished), you aren’t going to be in a big loss, because Motorola is being generous till Valentines day, as you would still receive a discount of $70 through February 14th 2014. </p>
<p> As always, this deal too would be running on the Motorola’s Moto Maker website, so if you wanted to spend some extra dollars for the customization of the device, you could do that at the same time. We’ll let you know a few hours before the deal goes live, so that you take the advantage of it. Check out the Moto X review we did, and you will know why we loved the device (except for the pricing then, which is now being reduced quite a lot). </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Deal: Buy Moto X (for $399 Original Price) and get free Google Chromecast from Motorola </p>
<p> The pricing cut for the Moto X was not long ago, but Motorola is making it seriously better with time. The new deal is, with no price change, Motorola is offering the Moto X with a free Google Chromecast for the same pricing of $399. How good is that? We know it’s just the $35 Chromecast, but that is quite a useful accessory, and that is one of the very frequently used options for companies to include in offers. </p>
<p> Motorola had recently priced Moto X at $399 off-contract permanently, and there was the recent addition of the Bamboo customization which had actually made the Moto X look interesting since its announcement, and that would cost you $100 extra but again it was worth it. Now, comparing all this with the earlier price of $549 at one time after the first price drop, Motorola has gone down a lot with the pricing, and to attract more buyers, they have come up with this new Chromecast offer. And again, Motorola is not totally under Google and they might have bought loads of Chromecasts from Google to sell them at their own stores, and now the stock isn’t selling out that well, thus they came up with yet another idea. </p>
<p> Moto X was one of the very well appreciated smartphone in the year 2013, firstly for the reason that it is now a product managed by Google and thus you would not have to wait for the Android updates, and secondly, it’s made in U.S. with the special crafting and that easily takes away the tag of “Made in China” which many buyers would take as a strong reason. </p>
<p> For those who already bought the Moto X after the recent price drop, it should be a news they would not be happy about, for the reason that they might have to shell out the extra money for a Chromecast dongle if you wanted one, and Motorola isn’t doing anything to compensate. If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to the Moto X, the company did release the Moto G recently, with the price tag of $179, a very impressive device for that price and it already has the Android 4.4.2 KitKat OS update, just for those who wanted to boast about running the latest OS version in their devices. </p>

This way user data, some application data, some more useful data like GUI elements, etc are stored on the SD card which all in all contribute in more updated way of using applications, but all of this is also responsible for poor performances of the Android phone. Here the poor performance is directly related to slower performances, low responsiveness of the touch screen, delayed touch input and jittery performance. Applications also accumulate lot of data as Cache, now this Cache helps in faster performance of that particular application, but as more and more Cache accumulation takes place the CPU or the processor performance is affected and is responsible for jittery performance. Thus somehow if we want to use the applications and keep the performance on the track we have an application which is definitely the solution for the itch. This application is 1 – Click Cleaner which will help you to clear all the Cache and data on the SD – card with just one simple click. </p>
<p> The most important point to check is that this application does not need a Rooted device. 1 – Click Cleaner will delete all the Cache, data and it also helps in managing your applications by uninstalling them if required, check the application details, force stop running application. Another feature that caught our interest is that the application can also help us in deleting SMSs in a very swift and friendly manner, while deleting the SMSs we can select if we want to delete unknown contact SMSs and known contact SMSs or all SMSs. Application also allows us to delete the recent calls accordingly. The newly introduced feature is the ‘Deep clear’, this feature allows us to delete useless files on the SD card and helps free up space on the SD card and delete useless files on SD card while uninstalling applications. The option ‘History clear’ helps us in deleting internet browsing history and calling records. The New UI is very intuitive and works really well, now there is button introduced on the main screen which says ‘clear all’, well, we all know what that option will do. The most commonly used options like message clear and Cache clear can now be easily accessed from the main screen itself, all thanks to the new UI. Thus using this application is definitely a worth try and thus one can easily keep their Android phone on track by deleting unnecessary files and Cache files of applications like Android market, browser, email, Twitter, Facebook. </p>

<p> This article is misleading. The Play Store keeps a record of everything you ever downloaded and there is no way to clear it. It can be accessed both through google dashboard and various methods in the play store. Anyone with access to you account or phone can view it at will and there is no way to remove, block or clear it. </p>
<p> This article was about the searches removed from that specific device search box and not from the synced account. </p>

<p> I have been surfing on-line more than three hours today, but I by no means found any interesting article like yours. It is pretty value sufficient for me. In my opinion, if all web owners and bloggers made just right content material as you probably did, the internet will probably be a lot more useful than ever before. </p>

<p> How to Remove / Delete Google Picasa Photos from Android Gallery </p>
<p> The Google Picasa albums syncing and flooding your Android gallery is always annoying, when you try to remove them from your device but fail to do so, because these photos are originally from your Google Picasa folder and not from your device, and you have got no option to remove them from your device directly. </p>
<p> Google’s recent change in rules has made your Google picasa folder merged into the Google Plus albums, and now you can access all your photos in the Google Plus photos folder. Now, if you wanted to remove the photos from appearing in your Android gallery, you need to first stop syncing the Google Photos through the settings. </p>
<p> Stop Syncing of Google Photos from your Android Phone </p>
<p> Although we mentioned in the title that stopping the syncing of the photos would remove the photos, it’s not the first step to do but the final one. First of all, you have to do some sacrifice by deleting these photos from your Google Photos albums after taking a backup of that. Follow the below guide correctly to delete the photos. </p>
<p> Firstly, ensure which albums or photos you want to remove from the gallery. As you can see, we are choosing “Dental Instruments” gallery which we choose to remove from the Android gallery section. </p>
<p> Now, open your Google Plus account and browse to the Photos section where these photos would be appearing. Open the album and select all the photos which you want to delete, and select every photo if you want to delete the folder itself. Then select “Delete” and the deletion of the photos would be done. </p>
<p> ** Do keep in mind that you download or take a backup of these photos before you delete them. </p>
<p> Once the photos are deleted, go to the gallery in your Android phone and go to options and select “Refresh” and this refreshing would start syncing the device with your Google photos, and the ones which are now not present in your Google photos section will be deleted from the Gallery too. </p>
<p> As you can see in the screenshot below, the album would be deleted and not show in the Android gallery. Now, the main step to follow after this is shown below. </p>
<p> We know most of you already did the mistake by syncing, thus the photos appeared in the gallery. Now, you need to stop syncing the photos by going to Settings > Accounts > your Google account in which the following options are available, and you need to uncheck Google Photos, so that it shows “Sync is Off“. </p>
<p> Once you have stopped syncing the photos from your Android device in your Google account, you can re-add the photos to your Google Plus photos section or the Google Picasa, and they now don’t appear in your Android phone. It’s a bit of work for you but we couldn’t find any better or easier option of syncing and removing these photos without deleting them from the Google photos section. </p>

<p> I have a Samsung Galaxy 5. I have tried all the solutions offered on all of the websites. I can follow all of the steps to untick the sycs to photos and picasso, but when trying to delete photos from the picasso album, I have no “all” under the applicaton manager. I am so frustrated. </p>
<p> I have a better idea still. When the user clicks ‘delete’ on the gallery the system give option, delete from here or delete from [source] or both. Then the system deletes in the next synch. WHY give the user the problem of chasing around trying to find where the pic they want to delete came from? They want it deleted NOW. This is a major problem for many users who do not have the savvy to chase around Android/data/com.android.providers.media, com.sec.android.gallery3d and reboot phones – all they want to do is delete an image/video that has got to their gallery. </p>
<p> Any system that requires system programming from basic users has been poorly designed. Is there nobody at google that cares about customers any more? </p>
<p> I have an LG G2, I am 60 & sorta slow when it comes to techy stuff, sorry, I don’t understand Stop Sync in accounts and also I don’t understand how to clear Cache/Data of the application Gallery </p>
<p> Not helpful, i was Looking For the Removing your all the picassa Online Photo from Android phone including Blogging, website, Google Plus, etc </p>
<p> I think I have a better solution, without deleting the pix. </p>
<p> – Stop Sync in Accounts. – Clear the Cache/Data of the application Gallery and Media Storage. – Delete the folders Android/data/com.android.providers.media, com.sec.android.gallery3d – Reboot the phone </p>
<p> I might not be 100% accurate in mentioning the folder, etc, but that works.. I do it every time I Reset my device or change ROM… 🙂 </p>
<p> On KitKat (4.4) I had to delete the cache files from /Pictures/cache (ie, not the Android folder) and reboot to make the change. </p>

So before you handover your phone to anyone be sure to unlink it. Now, the question is how would you unlink or remove Credit Card details from Android Market? </p>
<p> Remove Credit Card from Android Market </p>
<p> The Google Android Market and Google Checkout doesn’t have a clear explanation on how would a user remove the Credit Card details to opt out of Android Market future purchases. There is a way which we would explain here, follow the step by tutorial here. </p>
<p> Visit Google Checkout and login with your Google Account. Make sure that this is the same login by which you access your Android Market (the same email with which you have linked your Android Phone). </p>
<p> Click the ‘Edit Payment Methods’ located in the sidebar on the left. </p>

<p> How to Delete WhatsApp Images, Videos, Backups and Audio Messages Easily </p>
<p> WhatsApp is awesome. It takes up a lot of your time, but then it entertains you with groups of friends discussing stuff, sharing pictures and videos all the time. It is all good for the messaging, but is it good for the smartphone for the long run? If you are an active user with loads of chats happening during the entire day, you would see your Android phone getting filled with the content in no time, and the device running out of storage. Have you faced this issue, and then thought of searching for all the data that gets stored from WhatsApp? </p>
<p> There is an app for Android phones, which does the job of cleaning your phone and getting it rid of all the WhatsApp data. The app does nothing else than listing out everything in a categorized way to show all the data from WhatsApp. Everything from the profile pictures to the backups gets stored in the device, at different locations and that is the reason why it becomes hard for you as a user to delete each of the file by digging into the file system. </p>
<p> To use the app, just download the WCleaner app from Google Play Store and open it, and you would see the different categories – Profile Pictures, Images, WallPapers, Audio, Voice Notes, Videos and Backups. </p>
<p> You can delete the entire folder directly by tapping on the trash can beside to the folder, or if you wish to go individually, go into the folder and you would see the entire list of items. </p>
<p> Advantages of WCleaner app for Android: </p>
<p> Easy to use, with direct options and no hidden settings </p>
<p> Deletes all types of files that are related to Whatsapp </p>
<p> Media, i.e. images, videos are in separate folders for easy access </p>
<p> Option to even open and preview files before deleting them </p>
<p> Disadvantages of WCleaner app for Android: </p>
<p> There is no information about size of particular files in the folder </p>
<p> Ads – although this is the only way the developer is supported, but ads do annoy </p>
<p> There is an alternative to this – manually going into the gallery if you wish to delete only the images and videos, keeping the backups untouched. But an app which makes it easier, and is very small in size, is a better option. </p>

<p> can anybody help me pls….. </p>
<p> i had gone through each and every spec of the two but its stay two side yaar. </p>
<p> Hi Bought a Dell XCD 35 handset and I simply love this set for its quality especially at this price. Going by all the feedback in this forum I guess we need to have a mindshift here. Gone are the days of the Nokia handsets which were as hard as a brick, could survive a 5 story fall and have no qualms about it. If you go back 10 years from now computers had a lesser config than the phones which we have now. As a result we will have to live with some heat on the phones, lesser battery life and of course compromise on some features. Nokia, Sony still sell similar speced phones for double the price and a bit less of the problems mentioned above. As an alternative to all the problems with these phones I guess we need to act smart rather than crib over the issues. Carry your data cable if not your charger. I am sure a USB post should always be around. Camera in a phone is an added feature, lets leave it that way. It will work its way out of emergencies where you need a camera. Hope this helps …… </p>
<p> Will i get a fresh phone of xcd35 ??? n please let me know latest price offered.. my 2nd check listed phone is samsung galaxy fit s5670… give reviews.. is it worth buying.. ??? </p>
<p> @rut not as of now, but as soon as it arrives we will surely update with the same! </p>
<p> Dharmesh my anroid FB contacts app. is not working have tried after formatiing also but its of no use tell me how can i get it also if i want to upgrade this to 2.2 or 2.3 from where should i do it . </p>

<p> Why has the price of dell xcd35 been reduced drastically from 17k to 12k ???? Infact u get it at 10.7k on flipkart .. Is this better than lg optimus one? </p>
<p> @rdsoze the fresh production of dell xcd 35 has been stopped, so rates have been dropped ! </p>
<p> this is bloody handset which will make ur life a hell never ever buy this bloody china andset </p>

<p> Awsom handset launched by DELL i fully satisfy with these xcd28…u can get 1 year replace warranty…and price near 8000 to 8500 RS.. </p>
<p> i am trying to buy this cell but these comments puts me in confusion..i don’t like Chinese cell at all.. can anyone out there can tell me how to go for the Original one..i saw in homeshop18 they tells a lot but now these comments here really makes me crazy.. </p>
<p> this is a nice cell. battery backup is good if you close your all unneccesory application which runs inside your cell phone. </p>
<p> it a android mobile so it is good for virus protection. </p>
<p> Hey the battery backup is fine its just that you have to switch off unnecessary features like animation and heptic feedback etc. </p>
<p> @Cirtex – What would u rather hold in ur hand ?? A dell or some unknown Chinese phone ??? </p>
<p> I have seen some similar phones with same design and mostly the same features except the operating system, in some of the china devices. They are priced at nearly half of these Dell phones. </p>
<p> Never buy this product from dell. Pure chines handset with all the good features( battery, sound, 3G , GPS wifi, Bloooootuth Fm with headset, camera, LCD display, Microwave owen -produce high heat, Hit hard the tough screen by hammer, when I slide it zooms). I don’t know how I can through away one I purchased last week. Pathetic one. </p>

We have only talked about the Top 5 smartphones in each of its category, there are many other smartphones which are not mentioned in this article and will be discussed in the coming days to come. </p>
<p> Parameters went into the Suggestion of Smartphones: </p>
<p> XOLO Q1000 smartphone comes with the 5 inches of Screen Size along with the HD IPS Panel and Scratch resistant screen and with a thickness of 8.8mm thickness which is decent enough. With 1.2GHz of Quad Core processor, this device also comes with 1GB of RAM along with the 2100mAH of battery life.

<p> Spice and Coolpad joined hands together and recently came with the brilliant handset which is Mi-515.

If you already had a Canvas Series of smartphone, then this will just feel no less than an incremental hardware bump. Though, it’s a god try by Micromax which created enough hype, but pricing the device well above 18K INR for Micromax will be a disappointing move.

<p> I enjoy the writings of your website. Informing me of the most interesting devices I too read about. Will you continue to write about the new Nexus 5 from Google? My girlfriend has the Goo-Goo-Googlee Eyes for one. ThankYou, Mike Hunt </p>
<p> please suggest me best mobile below 20000 price tag from experia lg htc or samsung built with 1 gb ram dual core processor jelly bean with good battery backup. </p>
<p> You need to check out Lenovo 770P. Awesome device with 2 days back up (3500mAH battery),1.2 Ghz dual core and 1 GB Ram, excellent camera and good screen. Paid 13500.00 and extremely happy with the performance. Sadly, Lenovo seems to be poor at marketing their wares. </p>
<p> The only problem is that most of them do not sync with the bands of data that the US uses so one only gets EDGE (very, very slow data) and are not very useable here. When are the makers going to include the bands used in the US or the US is going to use only the bands of the foreign phones? </p>
<p> I just have a request. Whenever you write specs of any phone, could you also include the weight. Thank you. </p>
<p> unfortunately Samsung lost on the Specs and Value Front, so we couldn’t include the same! Galaxy GRAND is now OLD and GRAND Quattro had no comparable specs… </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Developers can Convert 2D Android Games into 3D Now </p>
<p> The 3D game converter will change 2D games that you have into a 3D one if he makes a game using the openGL graphics. At IFA 2011, LG Electronics has demonstrated OpenGL the 2D to 3D game conversion engine for mobiles and smartphones. The 3D Game Converter is expected to open more doors to 3D gaming. </p>
<p> The 3D Game converter would be included the LG Optimus 3D smartphone starting this October 2011 and the expected roll date would be determined by the mobile carrier. This would benefit both the game developers and smartphone users. So by this addition, small companies which offer 2D games would be able to provide 3D version of it and thus saving resources, cost or time or labour and on the other hand users of the mobile phone would be able to convert the 2D games into 3D anywhere anytime for no cost. </p>
<p> Once the 3D Game Converter is installed, users can enjoy 3D on their previously purchased 2D games and the games can be switched back to the 2D easily. </p>
<p> So how does 2D games are converted to 3D? </p>
<p> When a mobile owner opens the 2D games through 3D game converter the software checks whether if its listed among the 2D mobile games suitable for 3D conversion. So if the game is optimized then it will be converted to 3D usage and visuals. And if its not listed then the games can be converted to 3D by doing manual settings. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Disable Automatic Sign in of Google Talk </p>
<p> The one problem I have found with Google Talk on an Android device is how it signs me into Google Talk automatically whenever my phone is connected to the internet. It is pretty easy to disable this however in the Google Talk settings on your phone. Actually even when you turn on your phone (depending on the Android phone) it will automatically fire up Google Talk and before you know it you get a flood of instant messages from friends and business associates on your day off. In order to disable it just open up the Google Talk app and hit the menu button and go to the settings. There is a check box there which is probably ticked. This setting is aptly named ‘Automatically sign in’. Remove the tick and problem solved. </p>
<p> There are other ways to stop people from messaging you while having the comfort of being constantly connected and that is to set your status appropriately. Consider adding the words “currently mobile” as a preset status message. You might also just go into offline mode so you can see who is around in order to contact them when you feel like it. It is nice to have Google Talk open all of the time in some form if you are bored while travelling (as long as you are not the one driving) and it allows people to contact you easily in case of emergency. If your Google Talk status is set to “currently mobile” then people are likely to understand if you don’t respond. If they take offense because you haven’t responded then just lie and say that you weren’t around your phone when the message was received. </p>
<p> There is a mod available that allows people to see if you are on a mobile device. I am not sure if Google will integrate this as a standard Google Talk feature in the near future – however, they really should. A few times I have messaged someone who was mobile and curtly told that they were mobile and can’t respond easily. I wouldn’t have instant messaged them if I had realised they were in transit or at work. Maybe they should have set their device to “currently mobile” (snicker). Having instant messaging software on a mobile device is a good thing – especially for those of us who despise text messaging (guilty as charged – I much prefer calling someone rather than sending them a message that is easily taken out of context). </p>
<p> So, in summation you do have a few options if you are sick of having Google Talk automatically sign you in. If you like having the ability to use Google Talk while mobile then consider changing your status to accurately reflect that you are on a mobile device – if you just hate it then disable it from signing in. You may not be a Google Talk user and not have anyone in your contact list anyway – of course you can just add selected friends from other messaging networks because Google Talk is a cross protocol client. </p>

<p> I have an android and today I keep getting these messages telling me “google talk authentication failed” I do not use google talk and this is all news to me. I just started receiving these messages and it wouldn’t be so bad if I wasn’t receiving one every 15-20 seconds!!!! I can’t get it to stop! it is using up all of my battery life….please someone help!! </p>
<p> I have tried this but my android phone doesn’t have automatic sign in check box that I can find. </p>
<p> I am having one problem with Samsung Galaxy S2. I sign – in google talk and log-out, but when i was trying to login gtalk, my friend id is already sign- in. So, can you please tell me “how multi-user can sign- in in goolge talk” or How can i remove my friend ID, so that other can sign in. </p>
<p> Hi, the above solution doesnt really work. Inspite of unchecking the autologin check box. You will still find yourself logged in the next time you open the talk app. What is worse is that one can concurrently see the chat contents on the tablet even if you are chatting from your laptop in the “off the record” mode. </p>
<p> I am also having the problem with Samsung Galaxy P7\. how do I – in google talk log-out, then login with my a different user Id. I cant log out and it automatically log in with my previous id. So, can you please tell me “how multi-user can sign out and in, in goolge talk” or How can i remove my credentials from google talk, so that other can sign in. I have unticked the sign me in automatically button, but it does not and keep signing me in with my first user name. </p>
<p> How do i bring up a converstion with someone from my google talk app on my mobile phone to my google talk on desk top. When i open it up on desk top my converstion with that person isnt there? </p>
<p> i signed in to have google as my first page’/ my experience tells me this was a mistake. please change me back to microsoft </p>
<p> I am having one problem with Samsung Galaxy Fit. I sign – in google talk and log-out, but when i was trying to login with my friends Ids it automatically log in with my previous ids. So, can you please tell me “how multi-user can sign in in goolge talk” or How can i remove my credentials from google talk, so that other can sign in. </p>

The Google Checkout is a nice payment processor introduced by Google long ago and it’s the way only way you can purchase Android applications available for download at Google Play Store. Google Checkout works by attaching your Credit Card to your account as because it would remember your Credit Card information securely. For every application that you purchase or cancel the orders, you are notified with an email to your Inbox in Gmail. </p>
<p> If you are developers then you would see many sales and canceled orders as well. For every canceled orders, you are notified via email and many times you feel that these are unnecessary emails flooding your inbox. To prevent this notifications you can do it in easy way, check it out here. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to disable the email notification to your mail – </p>
<p> Log in into your Google Check out using the Google Account. </p>
<p> Go to Settings tab as seen on the top right side. </p>
<p> Now click on Preferences from the left side options. </p>
<p> On the left side you will find Order processing and uncheck the option of ‘Email me each time I receive an order, cancellation or other transaction’ option. </p>
<p> Hit Save Preferences to apply the settings. </p>
<p> And these settings will stop Google Checkout to send email of cancellation orders. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> How to Disable the “My Magazine” feature in Samsung Galaxy S5 </p>
<p> The My Magazine feature is a good addition to the new TouchWiz UI in the Galaxy S5, and this is similar to the Blinkfeed feature in the HTC Sense. This keeps its place on the extreme left when you scroll through the home screens, and it gives you the latest updates from the selected social media websites, and the stories are quite interesting as only the trending and interesting ones are shown there. For the HTC users, they had to wait for an update if they wanted to disable this feature, but Samsung isn’t bad on this part as there is a way you can disable the My Magazine feature if you didn’t want to use it. </p>
<p> For those who are going through the My Magazine app settings, there is nothing available there for you to do to disable the application or the newsfeed, as you need to go to the Application Manager for disabling the app and not just the news feed. </p>
<p> Scroll to Settings > Applications > Tap on Application Manager In the Application Manager, go to the “All” tab and there, locate the “My Magazine” app to open the settings for this particular application. </p>
<p> In the App info page of My Magazine, you would see the options “Force stop” and “Disable”. While force stopping the app would make the app non-functional for just a few seconds, you need to tap the “Disable” option to completely stop the app from working until you wanted it to function again. </p>
<p> You would get a warning saying “Disable built-in apps? Disabling built-in apps may cause errors in other apps”. You need to accept it and hit “OK” to disable the My Magazine application. </p>
<p> Once you tap the Disable option, this application would go into the “Disabled” apps list from where you could enable it anytime later. The My Magazine isn’t really an annoying app as it lies in the corner and opens only when you wanted to check the latest news feed, but you can easily disable it if you felt it shouldn’t have been there as one of the home screens at all. </p>

<p> Download AirCast to Play any Videos without Needing Google Chromecast </p>
<p> Ever since ChromeCast made an entry, there have been quite a lot of trials about alternatives, which enable the streaming even when you are not using the ChromeCast at all, but the device has the ChromeCast enabling and the job is done. We are talking about AirCast, an app being developed by Koushik Dutta, who shared it and said about the possibilities with this app. </p>
<p> AirCast is an Android app that lets you share videos from your Gallery, Dropbox, or Drive, straight to your Chromecast enabled TV. You get it now, with the possibility more than Youtube streaming, and without the need for the actual ChromeCast dongle. It’s quite easy to use, and it controls a lot of stuff including the streaming, share and play the videos from the various apps such as the Gallery, Dropbox and the Google Drive. </p>
<p> There’s a remote in the app that controls all the playing of the videos, sharing and streaming it and you can directly from the app, select the source app from where the videos can be played. There’s quite a few issues, and Koush is reverse engineering the protocols and thus not using the SDK. He reports that the app is in testing phase and thus it isn’t working on a few devices, such as the HTC One where the icon doesn’t appear in the Gallery app. </p>
<p> It was a self-destructing link, so here’s an alternative link for those who are looking to download and try the AirCast app: Click here. It would be a disappointment if we don’t see this app very soon in the Play Store. </p>
<p> Recently, there was one more excellent alternative for the Chromecast tool, which again didn’t need the Chromecast at all and the app would do everything needed without charging a penny – Cheapcast. </p>
<p> If at all you are one of those looking for the actual ChromeCast, go here to buy ChromeCast and read more reviews about it. </p>

<p> Is the Free PG Calculator app have the same functions as a T-83 calculator? Thanks </p>
<p> I would like to recommend a new scientific calculator for Android: PG Calculator </p>
<p> PG Calculator is a powerful scientific and financial calculator for Android with customizable user interface. </p>
<p> PG Calculator works in Algebraic and RPN modes. </p>
<p> PG Calculator is available in three different versions: Free, Standard and Pro. </p>
<p> PG Calculator allows to use mathematical functions described below: </p>
<p> Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division; * Power and roots; * Trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan; * Hyperbolic functions; * natural and decimal logarithms; * factorials; * conversion between binary, octal, hexadecimal, decimal and scientific (exponential) number formats; * Time Value of Money solver; * IP Subnet Calculator; </p>
<p> There is a library of common mathematical and physical constants which can be used in calculations in both RPN and Algebraic modes. PG Calculator also allows to use user-defined variables in expressions. </p>
<p> PG Calculator has built-in Time Value of Money solver and IP Subnet Calculator. </p>
<p> The user interface of the calculator can be changed by using various skins supplied with the application. </p>
<p> Woah that seems to be a powerful calculator. Algorithms, trigonometry and binary calculations too being done in it, the app is surely a great alternative to the simple calculator tool provided by the Android OS by default. </p>

<p> How to Download Files on Android Phone by Prompting from Computer </p>
<p> Searching for the files and making them downloaded on your mobile phone, even with some good browser is always hard because you are trying to do that on the limited screen with a lot of searching to do. How easy and good would that be when you get a chance to search and go to the download link in your web browser on the computer, and simply make the file downloaded in your smartphone. Of course one of the easy options for me was the drafting of link in the Gmail, and opening that in the smartphone’s Gmail app to get the download link easily, but to make things better, there’s an app called DownItOn.mobi which would make your smartphone download a file which you wanted it to. </p>
<p> For this to work, you don’t need to do much except for registering an account and downloading the Android app. Head to Google Play Store and download DownItOn.mobi app on your device, and then go to Downiton.mobi to register there. </p>
<p> Once you have registered, login to the service in both – Android phone and on the website. While logging in from your Android phone, you will see the “Registering device” status which would then add the device to the list so that you can select it whenever you wanted to make that particular phone download a file. </p>
<p> Now, for making the file downloaded, copy the download URL from the website and then go to downiton.mobi and enter the download link. Select the Android phone from the dropdown list, and click on “DOWN IT ON MOBI”. </p>
<p> The website would show the message in the bottom, saying “The link successfully sent to your device.” and that link would be added to the list of last 10 links. Check your Android smartphone and the file should be downloading already, if at all you have it connected to the Internet. </p>
<p> The file would be shown downloading, as given here and you can go to the Downloads list from the app itself. </p>
<p> One of the other advantages of this app is that you don’t need to worry about the connectivity, because you can force the app to download the files only when connected via Wi-Fi, and thus the device won’t download any files when you are connected to the web through the data network. </p>

<p> Download Google Drive Android App – How To Sync Files from Desktop </p>
<p> Google Drive shows a sudden appearance and launch in the Android Market, i.e. the Play Store where its a platform to create, share, collaborate and save all the stuff of yours. The document stuff just gets better with the Google Drive, and the long awaited feature from Google which was expected to be out on Tuesday, has been launched already and there are several things you can do with the same. The Google Drive assists in uploading and accessing all the files, and the file types include the videos, photos, PDF files and even all the Google Docs files. </p>
<p> To go into the depth about the Google Drive, there are several functions which can be done. These include: </p>
<p> Creation and editing of the Google Docs directly from Google Drive, and this can be done on real time, and the main advantage of this being that the users from several locations can edit the same document at the same time, just like one does on the desktop browsers (remember Google Wave?). </p>
<p> While someone is editing and creating new documents, you can add comments, reply to other comments on any of the files and Google doc and to enhance the productivity, Google has included the notifications which on real-time would let you know if someone commented on the shared items. </p>
<p> Google Drive is universal for products – One could install the same Drive from all the platforms including the mobile, computers with Windows, Mac OS etc. and the only exception right now is the iOS platform which hasn’t got the Google Drive support. </p>
<p> Security is what Google always focuses on, and the Drive is totally secure at one place and what the users would find the advantage of it, is that irrespective of what happens to the mobile phone or laptop or computer, the files and content that is present in the Google Drive stays the same. </p>
<p> What Google Drive can give to Android users: </p>
<p> Accessing the online stored photos, documents, videos and other files directly from the Android phone. </p>
<p> Sharing the files from the folder to any of your contacts. </p>
<p> Making quick changes to the spreadsheets and other documents in the Google docs. </p>
<p> Uploading files directly into the Google Drive folder from the file system of the Android phone. </p>
<p> Initially, the Google Drive comes with the free 5GB storage and this can later be upgraded to better plans where the following options of upgradation are available: </p>
<p> 25GB for $2.49 per month </p>
<p> 100GB for $4.99 per month </p>
<p> 1TB for $49.99 per month </p>
<p> One more advantage of the Google Drive upgradation is that the Gmail storage of what somewhere around 7GB right now is, gets expanded to 25GB and for the heavy users of Gmail would not have any hassle of deleting mails daily to maintain a good limit. </p>
<p> The Google Drive gets better with the search feature being more filtered, where one can search by the file type, name, owner name etc. The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology of the tool would recognize the content within the document that you scanned or captured using the device camera, and the search terms you enter would even help you search through those scanned documents and brings out results which the normal Google search or the Android search in the phone wouldn’t be able to do. </p>
<p> Conversion of the printed text into Google Document was long awaited directly into the Android devices, and the data entry stuff is made easier with no more than few seconds needed for the same. Just scan a paper with the printed text, and you would see the same text as the normal typed out text in a Google document which you can even access from the web. </p>
<p> The Google Drive is already popular and well known within an hour of its launch, and there are several features in the pipeline awaited by the users, and being worked on by the developers. </p>
<p> You need to go to drive.google.com to show your interest in using Google Drive, and the same can be downloaded through the Google Play store in your Android device. Syncing files is easy as once you get the desktop version of the Google Drive, you would be able to access and edit the documents at the same time from the mobile and desktop devices. </p>
<p> Is is possible to download/save a file from Google Drive to the phone – either internal memory or SD card? </p>
<p> yes its possible to save the file in the Google Drive, not directly though. you can move the same to DRIVE </p>
<p> Can access to Google Drive App be password protected on a mobile phone to avoid someone getting access to docs if the phone is lost or stolen? </p>
<p> No, as of now there is no such option to make it password protected. But yes, you need to login to access the Drive folder. </p>
<p> Is it possible to organize files directly from the Android App? If I create or upload a document/file, it is placed in the root of the “Drive”. Even if I navigate to a different folder, the file is placed in the root. </p>
<p> Having the same issue. Did you ever figure out how to organize files from your Android? </p>
<p> Question: Is syncing to and from Android *real* syncing? Are the contents of the desktop folder *downloaded* to your Android device for *offline* use? If not, I’ll stick with SugarSync for this functionality. </p>

Just reading your article made me put two and two together and realise it was after the Search App update on my phone that the car phone button started to give me Now instead of the old, clunky voice dial feature. </p>

<p> I install the apk in a samsung galaxy J7 and doesn’t appear the photosphere option… 🙁 just panorama, video and camara. WHY? </p>
<p> not working for my sony xperia c phone, photosphere seems to be absent from the camera </p>
<p> The app doesn’t works with my huawei ascend P6. It only say app not installed.. An idea ? </p>
<p> you need to make use of the apps which are there in Google PLAY Store for photosphere </p>
<p> my friend i installed Google Photosphere Camera App, in that i m not getting the photosphere option.it just shows pano,videoand photo option. </p>
<p> Moto G does not have gyroscope (gyroscope is not g-sensor and also is not accelerometer) and hence photosphere will not work. To confirm, I downloaded this APK and I could not see photosphere options and I can use only the usual panorama mode which the stock Moto G’s camera app provides. </p>
<p> worked perfectly on my galaxy s2 gt-i9100g and xperia mini pro sk17i both non rooted thanks for this awesome app </p>
<p> I just got the Galaxy 2014 Edition 10.1Note tablet.It runs Android 4.3, but doesn’t have Photosphere. It’s WiFi only, so no carrier involved. Would I be able to install Photosphere on it? Thank-you. </p>
<p> Works well on my rooted Xperia S. Photosphere is awesome! Only crashed when I touch the screen during a video recording . </p>
<p> Downloaded as instructed. Works perfect on my HTC One X+. All features including Aspect ratio, Video quality, image adjustments, iso, camera options, image stamp ……many more. Camera scene options big plus. Panorama, HDR, Scene selections. I don’t know why you would want to go back to stock camera. I have not tested all of these options yet but I have them LOL. I will update and let you know. Thanks Android Advices for good article and app link. </p>
<p> Installed smoothly on G-Note (N7000) running on Stock Jelly Bean 4.1.2 (India). No issues encountered so far. Works great in panorama as well as Photosphere mode. Haven’t tried out outdoor pictures yet. Indoor pictures has a problem in smooth stiching of all the images. But then that is probably because of camera position mis-alignment by me rather than a software issue. Great share. Thanks! </p>
<p> I installed this app, and it works perfectly with my galaxy s4, even though I don’t have the Google play edition </p>
<p> I downloaded the app but install tab alone not working. So can’t install. Please fix. </p>
<p> Did not work on my note 2. Said parser error. Anybody had any luck on creating photospheres on Note 2. My email is davidrenjenkins (atsignhere) gmail.com. Thanks! </p>
<p> Works fine except no logic how to save its hit and miss whether you have saved on a s4 </p>
<p> Hello please tell me how can I rollback to previous camera, I am facing problem with these, plz mail me. </p>
<p> Cool gadgets..before this I’ve install the rooted 1..now it can install without root..but it has no flash. .poor.. </p>

<p> Also ive had no problems with the camera. I can launch the stock GN2 camera and gallery or this camera or gallery. No crashes or issues so far. thanks again </p>
<p> Awesome, been wanting this camera feature for photosphere thought i was going to have to wait for 4.2 to get it. Thanks Galaxy Note 2 </p>
<p> @gaurav.:hey man there will be two camera apps in ur app browser…you can switch to any of the two by just clicking on it…..and if u open the google installed gallery n click camera at thw top it will ask complete action using… </p>

<p> Don’t worry ! after you install it, the new one camera will created. so you got two camera and gallery. </p>
<p> I have try it on GL LU6200 with Jelly Bean 4.1.2. it word fine and it’s a camera that i waiting for 6 months. </p>
<p> It will install a short cut, you should still have your original camera as well as, the photo sphere camera </p>
<p> Hi, I downloaded it on my GS3 and it works great! Previously i had trouble switching from camera to camcorder in the camera due to a sloppy rom flash, but now it switches seamlessly. It still crashes when I switch from back facing camera to selfportrait mode, but thats also because of my rom flash gone wrong </p>
<p> Hi there! I have problems installing it on a rooted Galaxy Ace S5830L @2.3.4: “Analysis error”.. any known issue? :S </p>
<p> Only good on quadcore jellybean base phone…will lagging of force close if use on dual core jellybean base phone..i have tested on S4..result is good..S3 good but lagging once you open the camera for the first time everytime you use..need to close and open for the 2nd time..and cannot use on galaxy grand, tab2 7.0 in..and S2 too. </p>
<p> Gallery and camera have been installed. I also was able to switch into sphere mode. But the calibration doesn`t work. You have to center a blue dot in the middle of a circle,i did that for like a minute, but it did not work. (I have a galaxy s4) </p>
<p> Will not let me install it. Keeps saying no file to open this. I’m running pacman ROM on galaxy s3. </p>

<p> hi, iam live in iran ,how I can use google play,for my device,i have sony ericsson live walkman wt19i with android 4.0.4 </p>
<p> Replace application notification didn’t appear. And when I open Google Play, it gives me notification that the application stop unexpectedly. Any help for this? Thanks alot. </p>
<p> i have experia x8 and i can’t find it, after going off my computer. Where is it stored? </p>
<p> i have experia x8 and i can’t find it, after going off my computer. Where is it stored? </p>
<p> I had to do a reset on my Archos 43 and downloaded this. It worked fine, but I tried to open up the market just now and it force closed 5 times each time I tried it-even after I restarted. Is there a fix for this? </p>
<p> I have a Nexus S 4G and I coped it it the phone then restarted and it instaled fine. </p>
<p> i have a micromax a60,while installing a parse error flashes with ‘problem parsing the package’…….. </p>
<p> Thanks so much! I did a software update on my HTC Inspire yesterday that updated to a newer version of android. I had received the google play update before the update, but since the update i had not yet received it. i tried to purchase something from the market and couldn’t bill it to AT&T anymore. Google said talk to AT&T and AT&T said talk to Google. this download has fixed this issue completely! Also, I downloaded straight to my phone and completely skipped the computer part of the download. It worked great just downloading to my phone. Thanks again!! </p>
<p> Thanks for posting worked perfectly on my Galaxy Tab 10.1 except it’s not necessary to do via usb computer connection since the tab can dl it. Thanks again! </p>
<p> After this manual installation, whether i’m able to use market further or Google play ll replace it? </p>
<p> It will replace the original Market application, but you’ll still have access to the samemarket. Note that if you had to hack your device to get the basic Market on the unit the application may refuse to install. </p>
<p> I was able to put Market on my Nextbook 7, but even after downloading the google play apk, the installer started to process it, clearly recognised the application then said that it would not be installed. There may very well be a profile required to do so. The google market recognises my device as a generic phone. (which it isn’t) so I’m able to download most of what I could for my Optimus but not all of it. Curiously enough I was able to get Netfix to install and run. </p>

<p> Worked fine, except it doesn’t change the numbers in the clock of the lock screen, maybe I did something wrong because in step 4 where it says “Now open the System > Fonts and then copy all the three .ttf files from the unzipped folder and paste them into your phone’s SD card inside the folder named “.fontchanger”.” </p>
<p> I copied 8, not 3 files from the zip to the sdcard folder named “.fontchanger” I didn’t do anything with System>Fonts. </p>
<p> Did I miss something or does it not change the clock font? </p>
<p> sir…………… i have two problems….. i copied the fonts…later opened font changer application there was a error </p>
<p> Superuser Required </p>
<p> Superuser access was not found on your device and therefore this application will have to be closed. A ROM with root is needed for Font Changer to work…. </p>
<p> i had using samsung galaxy gt5570 phone….using android.2.3.3. version s5570xxkpf…… how to root my device??? pls help me…….. 2question …………….. can i upgrade my phone to android 4.0 ice cream sandwitch offical version ???????? </p>

<p> hi..good afternoon, i have installed this application successfully…. but it need superuser access… so i neeed to root it… but i dont know how to root my galaxy 3…???..so i can change my font….. </p>
<p> I have a error message while doing the above process ” Superuser Required </p>
<p> Superuser access was not found on your device and therefore this application will have to be closed. A ROM with root is needed for Font Changer to work. ” Can anyone help me with the above message? </p>
<p> Hi I’m just tryin to get some help if I factory reset my phone to which I’m on gingerbread 2.3.4DDkQ5 and install the the official upgrade can I still root my phone.. If so can u tell me how please. Thank you </p>
<p> Its working for few others as mentioned in other comments, try to do the process correctly. </p>
<p> I’ve tried downloading the file a few times. Each time I try to unzip it it stops at around 60% and the error log reads “wrong password?”.I’ve tried copying the password from this page and typing it in myself and also tried a lower case “a” at the beginning. None of them seem to work. </p>
<p> It says wrong password “Androidadvices” for the zip. Offcourse, I have tried with no quotes. </p>
<p> Totally of topic in this article, but, is there any working 2.3.5 o 2.3.6 ROM coming to the Galaxy S? I’m still on 2.3.4, and, although it has some bugs, 2.3.5 was worse (the famous wifi issue). </p>
<p> I just wanted to note to others trying to apply this, the password is “Androidadvices.com” without the quotes, you need to insall the FontChanger (root) application. and finally, paste the font files in the .fontchanger directory in the sdcard directory. long press over the font and apply, then reboot. </p>
<p> Thanks Androidadvices, the font looks nice in the Galaxy S. </p>
<p> Glad it worked for you, it seems like our editor added a CAP A in the beginning of the password which is creating issues for others. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> How to Download & Install Android ADB and Fastboot on Windows PC? </p>
<p> Before explaining you through the procedure, here is a little explanation on what the Android ADB and Fastboot is. ADB is short for Android Debug Bridge, which is a platform that would provide a terminal or command based interface enabling the interaction between your computer and the Android device. ADB is available as a part of the platform tools which is given in the SDK, the software development kit by Google. </p>
<p> ADB basically is useful for the app developers to tamper the internal components of the computer operating system, and bring out the features which are not normally available to the user. Modding a firmware, playing around with the custom recoveries needs the changes to internal parts of the system, and that is all provided by the Android ADB. </p>
<p> The ADB is a very much needed tool if you wanted to make some advanced changes to the Android phone and it’s internal system. </p>
<p> Fastboot is another debugging bridge which is used to directly flash the filesystem to the Android devices, using the USB connection from the host. This even helps in flashing of the unsigned partition images. </p>
<p> Now, to set these ADB and Fastboot on the Windows PC, you need to first download the Android SDK app. You will have to select based on the chip used in your computer, whether it is a 32-bit or 64-bit one. Once you download that, follow the below given steps. </p>
<p> Once you have downloaded the SDK app file, extract it to your desktop so that it is easy to navigate. Open the extracted folder and you would see the sdk folder under which there is a sub folder named platform tools, and this is the folder you need because that contains the ADB and Fastboot files. Rename platform-tools to AndroidADB (really doesn’t matter but easy to remember). </p>
<p> Now, move that folder to the root of C:/ in ‘My Computer’. The path should show as C:\AndroidADB when you check the address bar. </p>
<p> Copying and placing it under this drive doesn’t finish the job, because you will need the command prompt to understand it and then run all the ADB commands under it. For this, you will have to set this folder under the system properties. Right Click on “My Computer” and go to Properties. There go to “Advanced System Settings” and under the Advanced tab, click on the bottom option – “Environment Variables”. </p>
<p> In the Environment Variables, go to System Variables and in that, “Path”. Under Path, you will see a list of different paths and here you need to add C:\AndroidADB in the end after a ; Save and then close the settings. </p>
<p> The ADB folder is now configured and now you can easily run the commands for both ADB and fastboot from the Command Prompt. To verify whether it went good, you need to connect your Android phone to the computer with the USB connection, and then open Command Prompt from the stand menu and type adb devices and press enter. It would show the list of devices that are connected and ready to accept commands through the bridge. </p>
<p> The bridging and using the commands helps a lot in advanced changes to the operating system and settings in the Android phones, but you will have to set up the ADB on any computer before doing it. </p>

<p> I have always just copied the entire SDK folder to C: and then copied CMD.exe. Into the platform tools folder. Made a shortcut of CMD.exe to my desktop and just run the shortcut. Works really well and easy to setup, also easy to update sdk when needed. </p>
<p> Can you pls explain the uses of this… And pls tel whether is this the rooting process…. </p>
<p> This is not the rooting process, and this actually creates a bridge where, in some easy words, some internal functions of the phone can be changed. For example, if you wanted to have a battery indicator with percentage shown in the status bar on the top, you can do that through ADB functions in command prompt. This is just a very small example though. There are several other possibilities with this. </p>

Overall Android L has received a positive feedback than compared with the looks of Ice Cream Sandwich, Jellybean and Kitkat OS which were looking almost similar. While the OLD UI was a mix of dark blue and default gray for the tablets, this new UI of material design is lot more sleeker and gives a very light design. Do check out some of the screen captures below; </p>
<p> Google also worked on simplifying the UI as once you sign into the Google sites, you need not login again to make use of the Google Sync capability. </p>

<p> Download Latest HTC’s Lock screen App from Google PLAY Store for Android device </p>
<p> Put your hands together to welcome HTC’ s lock screen officially in the Google App store. With brilliant looks and utility options, this lock screen can now be made used in many android smartphones. HTC initially only had these apps tied up with the One branded smartphones, but all thanks to the demand and the need which HTC figured out among users of other smartphone brands which made this happen for other HTC devices as well. This is not the first time when HTC has launched its branded apps in the PLAY Store for other android devices as we have earlier seen similar treatment with Blink feed and HTC’s Clock App. </p>
<p> This new app from HTC is available as the Lock screen app as mentioned in the screen captures below. With this new app, users can swipe right on the lock screen to land on the Blink feed or alternatively you can also swipe left to access the Widget Home. If user swipes on the lock screen, user can access the previously used application. The clock, weather and notifications are displayed on the Lock Screen which is the highlight of this app as this one completely redefines the lock screen. There are many users who have installed the Blinkfeed and the HTC’ s clock app, this is a complete and pure delight product. </p>
<p> With the standalone app, the updates will be certainly faster and app looks much cleaner than the ones which are provided as default in many android apps. Very soon, HTC will be adding in the new features in this app. The only sad part of this app is that as of now this app is only available with the HTC users and not for non-HTC users. </p>
<p> Do let us know in the comments section on which one is your current favorite lock screen app. </p>

<p> Download Latest WhatsApp APK to Access WhatsApp Web Feature – How To Setup </p>
<p> The latest feature of WhatsApp, the WhatsApp Web is finally here and you can download the latest version of the WhatsApp app for Android to get access to this feature. Though several users reported that even version v2.11.498 was showing the WhatsApp Web feature, that was not seen in the app we had, and the latest one was where we found the web feature available. </p>
<p> APKMirror was able to grab the latest version already, and we here have the APK version of it if you already wanted to check out the Web feature and start using WhatsApp from your Chrome browser. Following are the details for the same. </p>
<p> File name: com.whatsapp-2.11.500-450248-minAPI7.apk </p>
<p> Version: 2.11.500 </p>
<p> File size: 18.54 MB (19,439,184 bytes) </p>
<p> Minimum Android version: Android 2.1+ (Eclair, API 7) </p>
<p> The Change log mentioned for this particular version of WhatsApp says “Introducing WhatsApp Web”, thus this could be the official version from which the feature might be available, but we are just guessing. </p>
<p> To access WhatsApp Web, go to web.whatsapp.com and you will see a barcode on the same page. Open WhatsApp latest version after installing it on your Android smartphone, and in the menu you will see the option of “WhatsApp Web”. It will open the barcode scanner of itself and then you can scan the same and all the WhatsApp chats and groups will be accessible from the web version. </p>
<p> From the settings, we are able to notice that you can add multiple computers and this is pretty slick, for those who choose the usage from their computers rather than from the smaller smartphone screens. </p>
<p> Let us know if you face any issues, while either installing the latest version of WhatsApp by APK file or while accessing the WhatsApp web feature on your computer browser. Remember to use Google Chrome browser for the web access. </p>

<p> {APK} Whatsapp 2.11.508 APK with Voice Calling Feature & Material Design – Download Now </p>
<p> Wanna have WhatsApp app with Voice calling feature? WhatsApp will soon be announcing the launch of an all new version of app which will not only be roping in the voice calling feature but also will be bringing the new user interface. This new update also comes with a punch of material design and works on the devices which are on Android 2.1 and above. After the acquisition of WhatsApp by facebook, it seems like it will be the next biggest growth driver for the company. While this new app has still not made up to the Google Play Store, you can very well download and install the same with the help of a link mentioned at the end of this article. </p>
<p> The only catch here is that the voice calling will only work as of now if your device is on Android 4.4 and above OS. While it’s still unclear on whether WhatsApp will support the voice calling on the lower versions of android or not, we hope in coming updates to come this will be supported even to the devices which are on Gingerbread 2.3+. </p>
<p> A reddit user, Tropiux has mentioned that its not a compulsion to get an invite to start using the calling feature. Just go to the terminal and hit the below mentioned command in the device which has got the rooting privileges; </p>
<p> am start -n com.whatsapp/com.whatsapp.HomeActivity </p>
<p> Unfortunately, you will have to do this every time you want to make an outgoing call. Post enabling, just call to a user who has the WhatsApp’s calling feature app to get voice calling feature permanently enabled. While this drama of feature only being available to selected users is here to stay only until the app comes to Google Play Store, you can very well download and install this app in your Android smartphone. Do let us know in the comments section for any more info. </p>

<p> Micromax India yesterday launched a new Smart Phone called as the Canvas 4 which came up with some interesting features which we had listed yesterday in our blog post.

<p> Just download the APK file from the link given below and then proceed to the installation of this app. Ensure that you have enabled the option to “Allow installation of apps from sources other than the play store” from the Security section of your Phone. Once the app is installed, you would be asked to tap once on the same to Enable it following which you would get the lock screen active on your phone. </p>

<p> i don’t think it supports all devices… for me it says.. error.. wrong parsing in file my devices are samsung galaxy tab 2 and galaxy star </p>
<p> can give more sftwares provided by canvas 4 like 1.As soon as you move your head away from the screen of your smartphone the video will be paused. 2.Calling facility With this facility you can answer the call directly by bringing your smartphone near to your ear. </p>
<p> hey, i am using samsung galaxy s advance l9070 and this app is not working please suggest me </p>
<p> Thanx for this wonderful App. I m using Micromax Canvas HD n i m running 4.2.1 jellybean, n this app is working very nicely on my device. Micromax realy the great manufacturer,best of luck micromax n thanx for posting. Micromax proves that ‘Nothing Like Anything’. </p>
<p> Installed on Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7 P-3113. I have a custom Star Wars theme under construction on my Tab so the lock/unlock sounds are light saber sounds opening and closing. When screen locks, the saber retracting sound is activated, unlock sounds like a light saber activating. With this app installed, the closing sound comes on immediately followed by the opening sound. Not a bad idea though, does seem to be sticky and requires some effort to open. </p>
<p> Reinstalled and it worked now, but seems like the wallpaper of that canvas needs to be installed differently eh?? </p>
<p> Seems like it just needs some sound to be made to unlock it instead of a blow…which is kinda lame especially if you were in a crowdy place </p>
<p> This is part of the latest feature launched by Micromax in their new smart phone and this App is extracted from the same. You cannot expect from much them, and you are true in case of crowded places. </p>
<p> Installed on Galaxy Y s5360.. The shake function works very well but not the “unlock by blow”..Also unlock by sound worked only single time. What to do? </p>

Apart from the new in-app purchase, this update has slightly tweaked feedback / rating screen with stars redesigned for good. There’s also an explicit “Edit” button, which should make the ability to edit your review for obvious reasons. </p>

<p> Download New Gmail 4.7 APK with Vacation Responder, Send Review Any File & Kitkat Printing Support </p>
<p> We all know that Gmail was updated to 4.6.1 version by Google in the month of June, today it is further updated to the 4.7 version for Android. This updated application includes many new features like. </p>
<p> Vacation responder </p>
<p> KitKat printing </p>
<p> Archive downloading </p>
<p> Vacation Responder: </p>
<p> This new feature called as “Vacation responder” lets you specify the start and end dates. This is similar to what it is been in the third party email client like the Outlook. To set this option here are the steps. </p>
<p> Go to the Inbox and tap on the settings at the top right corner of the screen, then you will find three other options. Select the second option which is your Gmail ID. </p>
<p> Below the signature option you will find the Vacation responder option. Just tap on it. </p>
<p> Turn on the Vacation responder from the given option then enter the subject and the text. </p>
<p> The start and end date should also be set, although the end date can be an optional one. </p>
<p> Now at the top of right hand side you will find the DONE option </p>

<p> Archive Downloading: </p>
<p> The downloading of the ZIP and other archive files were blocked by Gmail, for Android for security. With this new feature coming with Gmail 4.7 update, we can download archive files, ZIP files, gzip files, bzip files and also the tar archive are enabled. So this also lets us send any type of files by attachment where previously only two options were present (attach picture and attach video). This feature also improves the performance of the device with low in memory (RAM) </p>

All thanks to Sammobile who have received this first and has bought in just for you. This S-Voice has been tested in Nexus 4 and works perfectly in Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. For all those who thought that this is the same as that of S-Voice which came with Galaxy S3, then this S-Voice comes by default in Galaxy S4 and is an improvised version of the same. </p>
<p> S-Voice uses a natural language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of Web services.

We generally don’t tend to use these kind of services more oftenly, but this version of S Voice can be used for all conditions. With the help of this app, you can Voice Dial, Create Memos, schedule appointments, tasks, set alarms and also you can have a check on Whether services. </p>
<p> Now, after knowing all the benefits of this app, Download S-Voice App APK from here to your computer. </p>
<p> Connect your Android device to the computer with the help of original USB cable and place the S Voice app APK in your device. </p>

<p> Pardon me but the links to hotfile doesn’t work since hotfile has been banned. Are the links going to be updated soon? Thank you in advanced </p>
<p> Here also …it doesn’t regocnize my emailadresses. Which one to use and please aswer ?? The installation of the phone screen sharing programm is in full chinese or something like that…pfff.. </p>
<p> Great post, but why use hotfile? It won’t allow me to download all the files. Why not just use Dropbox or Drive? Could you post a link to download all files at once? </p>
<p> Shit doesn’t work at all! Have installed the USB Drivers ages ago already. </p>
<p> Downloaded & INstalled both APK”s & the files inside the zip package. Didn’t update the program to avoid it from not starting again. </p>
<p> I start the program on my Windows 7 PC & Run the App on my S3. Try to login in the PC Program and it starts nagging about the fact there is no device found registered under the email adress??? </p>
<p> Hi All, have tried to the letter but no joy. Simple says that the model of computer and/or operating system are not supported. ASUS W8 64bit machine with a Note II. </p>
<p> Is there any additional Samsung account needed? I have the same problems: 1)My device associated email adress is not accepted, the Windows Application could not find the device. 2) I better do not run the update, because after that, the app would not start running. </p>
<p> What is this all about? The alternative app idea is great! I really want to use it, must be awesome and I really look forward to it! Please do I need an additional accounts anywhere? Could the app be fixed in near future? </p>
<p> Acer Netbook, Win7 64 and Galaxy GT-I9001+ rooted, flashed 4.2 jelly bean </p>
<p> If you go to the folder where the files for the pc software are kept and delete the update .exe after you install and before you open the program, it doesn’t run the update. </p>
<p> I can get the program to start then but can’t log on as it doesn’t recognise any of my email addresses. What to do? </p>
<p> It worked fine when I first installed it. Now, it does everything but accept keyboard input. Everytime I try the keyboard, a message pops up to turn on keyboard and mouse sharing – which is on. It’s cockpit error, but I can’t figure it out. Any suggestions? </p>
<p> Mine worked fine. And it still works except for the external keyboard. Whenever I try to type something, I get the message that Keyboard and Mouse Sharing must be turned on. They are turned on. Any ideas on what to do? </p>
<p> Hi, i’m having a problem. All installed as required, but when i open the “Phone Screen Sharing” on PC, it asks me for e-mail. I used my Samsung account e-mail, but it’s telling me “Could not find the devide registered under this email” How to solve it? </p>
<p> If I don’t run updates, it connects fine, but then asks for e-mail. After e-mail entered, I get response “Could not find the device registered under this email”. Simply can’t get past that point. </p>
<p> If allowed to run updates, the program doesn’t open when clicked on. </p>
<p> I’m on an ASUS Windows 64x bit Windows 7 Pro and trying to connect Galaxy S4 Zoom. </p>
<p> Hope you can help. Looks like great work’s been done so far. </p>
<p> Do you have any alternate download links for these files? I hate hotfile with a passion, not gonna pay just to be able to download more than 1 file per hour… </p>
<p> Same issue…will not run after first run update. If you’re going to post this then you need to show some support for the community by letting us know more details on how to get this to work with proper install instructions. </p>
<p> I have S3 and Windows 7. After installing both the APK files and the software onto my PC I am unable to make this work. When you run the software on the PC the software checks for updates and then no longer works when you try and launch the program on pc. Do I need both the Samsung app and the screen share APK on my phone? Is there a registration process for the email address used when running the software on your PC for the first time? </p>
<p> Clarification: Both APK files are installed on my phone and the screen share software is installed on my pc. </p>

<p> Download “Quad Drawer” to Beautify your Android Experience – Recommended </p>
<p> While the Stock Android Firmware version lacks the polisheshness when compared to the likes of IOS 7, all thanks to 9Million Applications in the Google PLAY Store which aims to make your Android experience the best. So, out of those 9 Million Apps which promises to provide you the best Android experience, we will today be talking about an App which is dubbed as “Quad Drawer”. With this app, it actually makes easier to access the tons of apps which you have installed in your device. This app not just provides the redefined Android experience but also is the quickest way to launch apps. It’s a simple app drawer: using the predictive keyboard, just type a few letters of the app you’re looking for and Quad will bring it to you. </p>
<p> While android users are not launching the apps the very same way, many options are there in place in the app drawer; </p>
<p> – Select how you want to sort your apps (alphabetically, by most used, by last used, by install date) – Select how your apps are displayed (grid or list) – Select the keyboard you want (default or predictive) </p>
<p> Visually, this app provides the light as well as dark theme out of which you can choose from. And just to tell you, this app is not an actual app or the launcher but it acts as a drawer which you can use along with the default Android launcher. Unfortunately, there are many launchers and which tries to change your habit of the way you use the phone which is very horrendous. Floating window is the highlight of this app. </p>
<p> The only sad part of this app is that this app is not available for Free as it comes with the price tag of $0.99. We thoroughly recommend you to use this app which completely redefines the experience of your droid. </p>

<p> I don’t need quad drawer since my xperia S does all this and something more on its own. </p>
<p> So stock android, lacks the polisheshness of ios 7. Think you’ll find that it isn’t out yet, I’ve the dev Beta, and it is a bad version of Android, ios 7 is the worst version so far, nothing new to it that you can’t get on android, but you never know with apple they might have kept something back till it’s official launch, </p>

<p> Download Router Keygen Android App Apk to Decipher WiFi WEP/WPA Key Generation </p>
<p> Finding a strong WiFi network beside your location and then finding out that it’s a secured network is quite disappointing, isn’t it? Especially if you’re a heavy internet user and there’s no other internet source around to get working while you’re out in a public place. In situations like those, your Android phone does remain with you always and there’s a way you could use that to get into that secured WiFi network you’ve always wanted to. </p>
<p> The Router Keygen Android Application deciphers WEP and WPA protection based passwords on a certain set of Modem router firmware versions. These, however being the most commonly used router firmware softwares, the app would be able to get inside a lot of WiFi networks in and around the neighbourhood. </p>
<p> Routers Supported </p>
<p> Thomson Based Routers (including Thomson, SpeedTouch, Orange, Infinitum, BBox, DMax, BigPond, O2Wireless and Otenet ) </p>
<p> This application uses a Bruteforce attacking method where multiple words will be tried one by one in a very rapid manner through a proceedure called as Bruteforce. Once the correct password is determined, the process is stopped immediately. </p>

<p> Download Skype for Android with Photo & Video Sharing Features </p>
<p> Skype is for always, one of the best messengers for desktops, tablet devices and for the mobile phones. But for Android, it had limited functionality, and things were limited to skype call, video call etc. Now Skype has launched their new version for the Android OS where you get to send photos and videos to your friends. This is a perfect addition when people were onto the hunt for apps and used a few like Viber, Whatsapp to share the audio and video files, along with the pictures, but now as the 2.6 version of Skype is out with the same features which the other apps provided, Skype can be the only app with all the needed communication functionality. </p>
<p> Apart from the sharing options, the new version of Skype even brings a few other improved features which include the increased battery life and the quality of video being better. The video quality improvement would be seen in the large tablet devices with the NVIDIA Tegra 2 chipset, especially the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, the Motorola Xoom and the Acer Iconia tablet. </p>
<p> The sharing options too are pretty easy, as you just need to go to the contact page and from there you would find all the options for sending files, either the audio, recording, video or the picture files from the gallery. And what you receive can be seen directly from the contact page who sent you those files. It doesn’t have a separate section for the sent and received files. </p>
<p> Skype now has included the support of video calling for all devices which have the Android operating system after 2.2 Froyo version. And we tested the quality of video in the video call, and it surely has got better for the front cameras too, which are usually the ones used for the video calling. </p>

<p> In talked it on my Asus prime infinity and I’m only getting sound no video on my movies… Don’t know what’s the deal… </p>
<p> Link not working. Gave a “Sorry … Page Not Found” error. Was looking for a video player capable of playing 1080 HD videos. I’ve got MX player android app on my Motorola Electrify. Though it does play, the view is not fluidic like on my PC. Any recommendations would be helpful. Thanks </p>
<p> Is there a newer beta version to this? I converted the movie 50/50 to a avi format for a friend and she could not play it. I gave her the vlc beta version and it started playing perfectly. </p>
<p> I think what NRHTX means is that the download link in the article is broken and gives a 404 error. Pleas repair the link so we can start testing this nice VLC app. </p>
<p> The page you are looking for no longer exists. Perhaps you can return back to the site’s homepage and see if you can find what you are looking for. Or, you can try finding it with the information below. </p>
<p> Where else can we download this wonderful PC App for my Android? </p>
<p> This is crap information the links DO NOT WORK don’t waste your time much better to wait until VLC launch the real one. </p>

<p> “To differentiate in simple terms, Tegra 3, Snapdragon S4, TI OMAP or the Exynos supports NEON APK build whereas, Tegra 2 processor devices supports “neon” format of apk file”… </p>
<p> This statement is so wrong! Grammatically and logically. Please make an effort to correct mistakes, before posting online. Otherwise, a great post. </p>
<p> its in alpha build, wait for next version to release! have you tried both the versions? </p>
<p> It doesn’t work in Galaxy note N7000. Tried both Neon & NonNeon versions. Forget MKV,WMV or other HD format files, it can’t even play MP4 or 3GPP files properly. 12 MB download wasted. Have to uninstall. To be fair the app warns that it is an alpha (unstable) version. </p>

<p> MIUI Express app is just more than a home launcher as it also replaces all the icons in your app drawer and also replaces the stock phone dialer, contacts, sms app and lock screen apps along with other apps.

<p> I installed the Yahoo Mail android app and created a Yahoo email account. I am supposed to be able to connect to other email accounts (POP3), but I cannot make the app. connect. The instructions given above do not work. </p>
<p> I installed Yahoo Mail for my android phone, but cannot get the app to access by POP3 email account (not Yahoo). The instruction to add accounts given above do not work. </p>
<p> I cant even find where to compose my mail. Where is this menu button that you speak of? because ive been pressing everywhere and trying to find it and I can just cant/ it is infuriating </p>
<p> I am a new android user, switched from an iPhone. Not too sure about this yet, it seems more complicated. It has taken me 5 days to get my email working on my phone. I went to the ATT store and they were clueless. I finally went to yahoo mail on the browser, it said to download the app, and now it works. Anyway, the menu button is in the bottom left corner of the phone itself, mine looks like a group of 4 squares. (My 22 year old step daughter had to show me what it was for…)It brings up menus for various apps that are running. Good luck…but I think I miss my iPhone. Julia </p>

<p> How to Dual Boot between Ubuntu & Android OS – Details, Installation Tips </p>
<p> The Ubuntu team has been showcasing some excellent stuff in the Ubuntu OS for mobiles, and now finally, they have come up with a very exciting news for the developers, where they are going to allow the dual booting between the Android OS and the Ubuntu OS, a developer preview as of now, and would not be available for the normal users right now. The reason for this being available only for the developers, is the risk involved, and it is for those who are comfortable in flashing the devices and know how to flash it with the partition layout. </p>
<p> The Dual boot with Ubuntu supports the several Android ROMs, including the Stock, CyanogenMod or AOSP etc., and the Ubuntu installation is possible with the different versions available in the phablet-flash channels. </p>
<p> Doesn’t all this remind you of the Ubuntu Edge smartphone which was going to come with the dual-boot between Android OS and Ubuntu? yes, the one which didn’t actually work out because the team couldn’t collect the funds they had set as a target. </p>
<p> The best part about this Dual boot with the Ubuntu OS, is that you won’t need to run any command lines to switch between the two operating systems, and a simple application would be able in doing that for you. It would be the same app which would even help in installing Ubuntu, and upgrading it or to switch to the other OS. </p>
<p> Tips to install the Dual Boot on Ubuntu OS </p>
<p> Although we won’t be sharing all the steps here, following are a few things you need to ensure before doing anything to get the Dual Boot running in your device. </p>
<p> You need to have the Nexus 4 (yes, this is the only device where Ubuntu team has tested this, although they say it should work with Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 7 and Nexus 10) – Check out how to install Ubuntu OS on Nexus 4. </p>
<p> Should be running Android 4.2 Jelly Bean OS or higher </p>
<p> Should have an unlocked bootloader, and at least 2.7GB of free space </p>
<p> ADB tools running on your desktop computer </p>
<p> Enable the USB debugging on your smartphone </p>
<p> Keep the device backed up, or take a backup to the computer before proceeding with the installation, as you cannot be sure that all the steps would go right, and the data safety is not guaranteed. </p>

<p> The Best Battery Saving App for Android – Du Battery Saver Review </p>
<p> No matter how powerful a smartphone is made, it sells more than any other device in its range for a single reason – the battery life. There’s no one who want to compromise on the battery of a smartphone for something else. But when you have decided to go with one, and realise later that the device isn’t so good as expected, at least for the battery life, you’ll look for optimisation rather than to sell and search for a better deal. </p>
<p> There are loads of applications for each smartphone OS, which are known to help you save some power on your device. One of them does a commendable job in that, and it already well known in the Android user masses. It comes with a simple job – to increase the battery life of the Android phones and tablets. To be frank, we haven’t seen the use of tablets so much that there is a need for saving battery, but after having used a lot of Android smartphones with varied battery capacities, the DU Battery Saver seems to be a perfect tool for someone wanting to see the remaining battery power take them through for a few more hours and they expect. </p>
<p> The best part about the app is that you don’t really see it taking control of your device, but suggesting most of the tweaks you could do with the settings, and the app boasts to have increased the battery life of the device by about 70%. </p>
<p> Launching the DU Battery Saver app shows up the information about the estimate time remaining on the power left in the battery, and there is an Optimize button that has to be pressed, and on doing that, one would see the magic and the estimated time increases. </p>
<p> One important thing about the app is its reporting of the phone temperature, based on which one can estimate how faster will the battery drain. A heated up phone usually sees the battery draining faster, and when the temperature is normal, the drain is normal. </p>
<p> While the battery tab in the application shows the graph with the charge percentage, the monitor tab is where you get the actual information about the applications and their usage, for the user to decide on whether any battery-draining app has to be force closed temporarily. The graph of battery percentage shows the percentage changes for every two hours. </p>
<p> The battery saver section has quite a lot to offer, for the free option. While there is also a Smart option with advanced features, which is where you need to pay $2.99, and that is totally worth it, as it does the scheduling, auto clearing functions on lock screen and such. In the saver modes, you get to see Prolong saver, General saver, Sleep mode and My mode (which the user can choose to save the current settings, and switch on whenever the battery is low). </p>
<p> This area of modes is what brings in the real difference, if you give some time and set things up perfectly. </p>
<p> The way your smartphone gets charged and discharged, is an important factor in the longevity and efficiency of the battery of it. The app suggests you how and when to charge the battery in the right way. There are types such as Fast Charge, Full Charge, Trickle Charge and Healthy Charge. The app gets really beneficial when you set up modes and start using them. For example, you know how you are going to use your device during long flights, or while watching a movie. Set up modes in that way, and the app does rest of the job. </p>
<p> When we talk of the virtual money purchase, you aren’t paying anything here. The DU Battery Saver app recommends you a few apps, that are to be downloaded so that you earn some coins. Using these coins, you can unlock the premium features, like automatic scanning of applications that are power-hungry, scheduling the profiles and modes so you don’t have to manually set them up always, managing even the clock speed of the processor (only if you have root access to the device). </p>
<p> There are alterations done to screen brightness level, timeout, vibrate during calls, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data, Auto Syncing and Haptic Feedback. Even if you are not that cautious about battery life, the optimization even helps in performance betterment. </p>
<p> The widget showing the temperature of the device, comes really handy. While using data network for a long time and the screen turned ON, the temperature did rise and I could come to a conclusion whether to give the device some rest, or the battery drain becomes dramatic at times. </p>
<p> While the application itself is useful and shows itself up always in the notification panel, there are some widgets that can be placed on the home screens, to get a quick view about the stats and estimate battery life. Four different widgets, each having unique roles, are available. Of them, the 4×1 is something you should consider using, as it shows the time left for the battery to get down to zero, the connectivity notifier, and also a button to Optimize and kill the apps that are draining the battery. </p>
<p> So overall, the DU Battery Saver app has a lot to do, and there is no reason why one should not use it. Especially, when you aren’t asked a penny to download and start enhancing the life of your battery, and time between charges. The DU Battery Saver is available on Play Store: Link </p>

<p> The Best Android Phone Speed Booster App with Device Cleaning & Optimization </p>
<p> Who doesn’t want their smartphones to be fast enough to handle apps and not have any lag? Buying a high-end smartphone with the latest high-end processor and the other quality internal hardware isn’t enough feel your phone’s performance, because you might be stuffing a lot of stuff into the background and slowing down the device so much that the phone isn’t able to handle the multitasking and heavy apps at ease. In order to improve performance, you need to use some management apps which take care of most of the processes and apps to make your phone work smoother. </p>
<p> One really good app in this category, which helps boost the speed of Android smartphones, is DU Speed Booster, which has a wide range of features. It doesn’t only kill inactive apps or processes, but in fact does a lot to improve your phone’s performance. Let’s dig into the details to see what’s offered by the app. </p>
<p> Scoring and Optimizing: There’s a direct way to check the score of your entire smartphone. Once the app assesses everything, a specific score is given out of 100, and you can then choose to Optimize with a single tap when the app says that optimization is needed. This is an overall calculator of performance, so you don’t have to manually check for problems in each area. </p>
<p> The different features you can use in DU Speed Booster, include: </p>
<p> Accelerator – To help your phone maintain top speed </p>
<p> The accelerator shows you the current running processes, and the apps that auto-start. For rooted phones, you can freeze the app manager and free up memory in the device. The process manager shows how much memory is free and how many processes need to be cleared in order to free more memory. The number of slow down issues are displayed, and the “Accelerate” button can speed up your device in a single tap. </p>
<p> Trash Cleaner – To clean the cache and residual files </p>
<p> The trash cleaner section shows you what percentage of trash files, apps, residual system files, compressed files, and more are present in your phone’s internal storage as well as in its SD card. The Cache cleaner in it cleans the trash left by apps and you can choose to either remove the cache for individual apps, or for all apps at once. </p>
<p> In the Residual cleaner, you can see the residual system trash files and the app trash files. Swiping any of them gives you the option to either clean it or see more details. </p>
<p> App Manager – uninstall and manage apk files </p>
<p> Just like most other Application managers, DU Speed Booster’s manager section comes with a list of the applications installed in your phone, and you can choose to uninstall/manage the apps individually or multiple apps at once. There’s also a separate section for System pre-installed apps (bloatware) which are not directly shown in many app managers, and here you can choose to delete pre-installed apps. This is a great function, because you usually need to root your phone to be able to do this. </p>
<p> There’s also an option for moving apps to the SD card, in which you are given information about which apps can be transferred from the internal storage to the SD card. You can move apps to SD right away if there’s less space available internally. </p>
<p> Game Booster – Speed up your Android games </p>
<p> This is one of the best original features in DU Speed Booster, which helps make your games run faster. The app automatically detects and lists games that can be sped up, or you can manually select games one-by-one. The app then allocates the system resources in such a way that the game operation is detected and improved, thus benefiting your frames-per-second graphics output. </p>
<p> Security – Permissions, Call & SMS Blacklist </p>
<p> The DU Security feature has quite a lot of functions. Not only does it keep your phone safe from viruses, but it also includes very useful options like Contact Blocking (Calls & SMS), the ability to check the permissions for each app, and the ability to disable any apps if they pose any threat to the security of your phone. </p>
<p> The Permission Manager shows you which apps have certain permissions; i.e. the apps that can make calls, those that can read messages, those that can use location services, etc. You can delete any app that you feel is using permissions that it shouldn’t have. </p>
<p> Call & SMS Blocker allows you to add contacts to blacklist, and then you can see which calls and SMS’es are blocked by the app, if you wanted to check. </p>
<p> Battery Saver </p>
<p> This feature again negates the need to use a dedicated app for saving battery life in your smartphone. The app shows how much the usage time can be extended, if the user enables the battery saver. There are no special features apart from the enabling/disabling options but it does what it is supposed to – enhance the usage time. </p>
<p> The settings section and the spaceship </p>
<p> The settings area doesn’t have many options, because whatever you wanted was already there in the big list of services in the app. However, from Setings you can place widgets on the home screen or plce a Quick Switch widget with a floating window which can display on every screen or just on the home screen. The floating window not only gives you the ability to conveniently speed up the system, but also includes shortcuts to connectivity options such as Wi-Fi, Data Network, Ringtones, Brightness, etc. </p>
<p> There’s also a beautiful spaceship option, which upon lauching on a particular place on the screen triggers DU Speed Booster to clean up the processes and make the device faster than it is currently. The spaceship launches, and it shows you how many processes were killed and how much RAM was freed up, but you cannot delete the residual and trash files using this option. </p>
<p> Overall, DU Speed Booster is a pretty brilliant way to make your phone free of everything you don’t want but had no easy way to clean, and it also lets you easily free up RAM by killing current processes that are running in the background. </p>
<p> The app is available for Free on the Google Play Store: </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Easy Way to Block a Number from Calling Your Android </p>
<p> You are going to get unsolicited calls no matter what phone you use. There are a few methods (some specific to the Android) that you can utilise in order to reduce the amount of spam phone calls that you receive. Sometimes it is not just spam phone calls that are the problem. You may be getting calls from a pesky client or from someone who just doesn’t like you. If you know the number then you are one step ahead of the game and can take steps to block the number although this is not going to halt all communications from this person – they might opt to use a pay phone or a private number and then you are back at square one. Following are a few things you can do (some relevant to the Android in particular) to combat this. </p>
<p> Be Careful with your Number </p>
<p> While this is not a sure fire way to avoid pranksters and spammers – it is the first step in safeguarding your privacy. Don’t use your phone number for websites that are likely to spam your number with auto-diallers or telemarketing schemes. This might be commonsense but it is shocking to see how many people are happy to put their phone number into a scheme that promises to text them their IQ or some other rubbish information. Don’t give it out to anyone unless you are going to be forming a friendship or business relationship with them. </p>
<p> Answering Private Numbers </p>
<p> I know many people who refuse to answer calls from private numbers. This is a stupid way to fix the problem though – especially for those who run a business. You might neglect to answer a private number from a potential client who is willing to throw money at you to get a job done. There is a time to neglect to answer private calls however. If you are getting a relentless barrage of prank calls and then all of a sudden a call comes through on a private number, chances are the prankster turned the number sending function off on their phone. </p>
<p> Android Call Blocking Apps </p>
<p> There are so many of these available for free. However, they don’t promise one hundred percent effectiveness. They will only block the numbers that you tell them to block. If the prankster is using a private number then it is going to still get through. </p>
<p> Android’s Send to Voicemail Feature </p>
<p> This is another great function offered by the majority of Android phones. You can actually set specific numbers to go straight to voicemail. Again, this is heavily reliant on you knowing the number of the prankster or spammer. It is not going to work for private numbers. To turn this on look around in the settings for the individual number and there should be an option to enable this function depending on the Android phone, Android version and the manufacturer of the phone. </p>
<p> Don’t be dismayed if none of these features work. You can always contact your carrier and have the number blocked. If the person is still harassing you consider taking legal action against them. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> How to Enable or Disable Apps running in Background on Android Devices </p>
<p> With over 450,000 apps and counting on the Play Store, there are many applications which run in the background without the permisson of the user, making the phone much slower and also sometimes, by collecting some data in the background etc. </p>
<p> For this purpose, one could use Task Managers or Task Killer applications which are available aplenty in the Android Play Store or even some widgets which can kill all the running apps in the background in one click. However, sometimes it might be disadvantageous. Say Skype is running the background and you want to kill it, one could do so manually or use a third party task manager app. However, some of these apps from unknown developers do not kill just the app but also some processes that are used by the app which are also required for the phone’s normal functioning. By disabling the app, it totally disappears from the app drawer as well and no third party app can execute it. </p>
<p> Thus, it is recommended to use trusted Task manager applications or the default one in Android, which is the best alternative. To use this, follow these instructions : </p>
<p> Open the App drawer from your homescreen and choose Settings. Alternatively, ICS devices also have a quick shortcut to settings from the notification bar when pulled down from the top. </p>
<p> Once you’re into settings, choose ‘Apps’ from the list there. </p>
<p> Here, you will see three tabs on the top namely ‘On SD Card’ , ‘Running’ and ‘All’ . </p>
<p> Tap on All and you’ll be taken into the screen displaying all the installed apps on your phone along with default stock apps of Android. </p>
<p> Choose the app that you want to stop and you’ll get two boxes named ‘Force Stop’ and ‘Disable’ . </p>
<p> Tap on the ‘Disable’ button and a warning notification pop-up box might come up asking if you’re sure in executing this action. Tap ‘OK’ . </p>
<p> Now the app is disabled and is pushed towards the end of the list. To enable, choose the app again and choose Enable. </p>
<p> Note that by disabling the app, the app will disappear from the App drawer until it is enabled once again in the settings page. To temporarily stop apps, you should choose the ‘Force Stop’ button while disabling it totally stops the app from being executed or functioning till it is enabled manually by the user. </p>

<p> Of you use the home button to stop your apps you use more power. Your phone must restart the apps and that takes more power (Facebook, twitter, snapchat). </p>
<p> Wat do I do if I have accidently forced stop apps and disabled them??? How and can I enable them again??? </p>
<p> I install severall apps like clean master, du attery saver to stop background work. But my galaxy grand duos still work very slow. What should i do? Please help. </p>
<p> I have two android phones and i must say ANDROID is just junk. Theres a lot of unnecessary stuff to run and eg. virus, malware (apps loading unecessarily eg. free texts, free this or that ) and third party killer apps etc even though im running 3 apps (the background apps running are like 32 and so it was killing my RAM on two new samsung phones of different models .. therefore … calls drop, cant make calls etc .. WHAT A JOKE. </p>
<p> Adroid software is poorly crafted. 1. Need third party apps (virus cleaners, malware cleaners, task killers etc) 2. apps that dont work on the phone are downloaed on playstore – crashing get what you pay for id rather pay 99c than waste time 3. advertising — designed to be clicked — hey id rather pay for advert free apps </p>
<p> Im going back to apple – sleeker, classy. better to drive an older european car than a new Korean piece of Samsung junk!! </p>
<p> I forced restart, but I can’t see anywhere to restart the programs. All it says its force stop. When I click on it it says that the program will now restart…but it doesn’t. Using Samsung Galaxy Y </p>
<p> Comparing “Task Killers”, is unnecessary. If you are using android 4.0.+ then one should Do This Instead: Hold down the home button.(Don’t tap. Hold.) User applications will appear. Swipe Applications (left or right) to turn them off. </p>
<p> I have an evo 3d and i disabled facebook and i cant find where to ebable it on my settings but it does show it in the play store when i search the app but when i press enable it says the goole play store has stopped working and closes it self. So idk how to enable it? </p>
<p> Hi, does this work on even the xperia xu phone? I tried it but there is no ‘enable’ button. Do you know what i can do? I accidentally hit force stop on keyboard and now it wont work. Thanks. </p>
<p> I hav a Sony experia u and where do i find the place that says force stop or disable??? </p>
<p> I don’t get disable! The only options I get are force stop and cancel! What do I do now?! </p>
<p> I disable email app on galaxy note but i lost it in setting. no where? what should i do??? </p>
<p> On my Samsung Galaxy Fit S5670; when I tap on the App, I get ‘Force Stop’ or ‘Uninstall’ as options. Is ‘Uninstall’ same as ‘Disable’? </p>
<p> No. Uninstall will remove the application from your device. You will then need to re-install. If you just want the app to stop for a time-being, you should FORCE STOP not UNINSTALL. </p>
<p> Some apps, like Chrome Browser for instance take up 70MB of storage space. If you perform an “Uninstall Updates” before “Disabling” it will be reverted back to it’s factory state, which will only take up 2MB of storage, freeing up a massive 68MB of space. My RAM used to get swallowed up by the bloatware apps constantly cacheing. You have to make the decision if you’re ever going to use that app again. I was totally frustrated with Chrome, so I now use Maxthon. </p>

<p> Enable GPS & WiFi via SMS Message & Find your Lost Phone Location Easily </p>
<p> Many times it happens that you forget your phone at some places that you visit and you forget it to keep it safe in your pocket. Finally you keep searching for it and sometimes you are lucky enough to get it back, in most cases it’s stolen by someone else and there is no option left to find the phone. </p>
<p> Since the evolution of technology various tools and applications are developed to have a control on your lost phone as well. You can track, locate your lost phone using the Prey AntiTheft application and also do a Wipe lock date on stolen phones. SMS GPS Enabler is another application which might come handy to enable Wi Fi, GPS via SMS to your lost Android phone. </p>
<p> As soon as you install this application and run it on your mobile phone, you will see a screen to enable Wi-Fi and enable GPS. You need to tick it. </p>
<p> Also there is the option of Wi Fi password and GPS password for the same. </p>
<p> You can also find the Ringer settings among the last options but all the options inside it are for the paid subscription only. </p>
<p> The idea behind enabling GPS and Wi Fi is to have a higher accuracy of finding the position of your phone. </p>
<p> There is also advanced version of this application available which will highlight the other options and its priced at $ 0.99 for one time payment. </p>
<p> SMS GPS Enabler Application Download </p>

<p> Alternatively you can download SMS GPS Enabler using the QR code mentioned below. You needed to open the QR code scanning application and then point it to the below QR code – </p>
<p> Verdict </p>
<p> Its a good application if you purchase the paid version or else it doesn’t serve any purpose. The chances of this application installation is quite less because losing your phone is not a daily job, its one in a while. </p>

<p> Dear Shah, you should use some app that alert you on SIM card change. this will be helpful if you use these application along with MobiUCare and SeekDroid. </p>
<p> Normally,after stealing a phone, the thief will immediately swich off the phone and change the SIM card. Some smarter ones can even change the OS. Under those circumstances, how effective is this anti-theft application? </p>
<p> This is in the case of you lost your phone but if any thief changes the SIM card, changes OS, this does not work. </p>

<p> Enable 31 Hidden Options on Samsung Galaxy S4 & Note II – Download Free App </p>
<p> The Samsung Android smartphones do come with a long list of hidden options, especially in the Samsung Galaxy Note II and the Galaxy S4, which come as the CSC files and it’s just a matter of enabling them for the hidden options to be a super user taking more advantage of the device options. </p>
<p> If you are unaware of all this, the CSC editors on the Android devices make it possible for the users to modify the various hidden settings and features, and some of those features that we were looking for in the normal settings, are present but hidden which can be exposed and changed by doing the following steps: </p>
<p> There’s an app available on the Play Store which would do the job of changing the hidden settings on the Galaxy S4 and the Note II, and some of the settings are as follows: </p>
<p> Adding an option of Shutter sound on/off to the camera app </p>
<p> Turning on Infinite Scroll mode on the launcher and app drawer </p>
<p> Extending how many contacts you can join together </p>
<p> If you have some knowledge about all this, entering the file system as a developer and making the changes to the settings is possible, but that could be dangerous and cause permanent issues to the device, so the app makes it easier. </p>
<p> For you to make these changes, the device has to be rooted or else the process wouldn’t happen. There are several different categories in which the settings can be changed, and these include – Messages app, Dialer app, Contacts, Browser, Camera, System Preferences, Launcher and App Drawer, Gallery app settings. </p>
<p> There is an automatic backup created by the app itself, so that it could be restored if anything goes wrong anytime. As for others who wanted to try this on their device, other than the S4 and Note II, they have to ensure that the device has got Android 4.1 Jelly Bean or later, and it’s not guaranteed that this app would work for all the devices, but because you can bring things back to normal, give it a try. </p>
<p> One of the favorite features for me is the toggling of the shutter sound, and this app makes that easier for me through the Camera app directly. You can keep trying to change the settings, add or remove features but in the end, if you wanted to have everything back to normal, there’s a simple touch of the button needed in the bottom which brings everything to Default. The app supports devices which implement feature.xml or an others.xml file. </p>

<p> How to Enable Inverted Mode in Android ICS to Save Battery </p>
<p> If you are having one of the latest Android smartphones running ICS or running Android Ice Cream Sandwich on your current phone, you can enable the inverted mode to save battery. Inverted mode is a mode where the colors are displayed exactly the opposite way of how they are originally meant to be displayed. </p>
<p> For example, on a web page, you would be seeing the background in black and the texts and images on it in black instead of the normal way of seeing the background in white and text in black. </p>
<p> How does this work : </p>
<p> Using a black background while reading your webpages instead of white is a very efficient way to save the battery power consumed by your mobile screen display. And nowadays mobile phones come with highly powerful HD displays, so it would matter a lot if your display could save some battery. While there are a lot of debates if Google should go black on its background to save over 750 Megawatt-hours per year, you can start doing this right away on your Android ICS phone to save battery. </p>
<p> How to enable Inverted Mode : </p>
<p> On your Android ICS phone, open the App drawer and click on the ‘Internet’ app. </p>
<p> Now press the Menu/Options key and pick the ‘Settings’ option by tapping on it. </p>
<p> Click on ‘Accessibility’ to enter the sub-category of options. </p>
<p> Once you are within the Accessibility sub-category, scroll down and you will see an option to turn Inverted Reading on with a description line that reads ‘Black becomes white and vice versa’. Tap on it to enable. </p>
<p> Now you will see a preview of the webpage you are currently viewing just to give you a quick idea of how it looks. </p>
<p> Go back and enjoy browsing in Inverted Mode. </p>
<p> Now that you have Inverted Mode enabled, you can turn it off whenever you want. However, if you are comfortable browsing this way, do keep it on as it can conserve battery on your Android ICS Smartphone. Do let us know in the comments how much of battery it helps you save on a daily run. </p>
<p> 5 Comments </p>
<p> I would like to share with you some comments on the new version of ICS on smart phone. I am using SGS II, it was installed Gingerbread, then I have just upgraded it to ICS and I really love it. ICS does save a lot of battery, even if the Wi-Fi is on whole night, just only 3% of battery was exhausted.I really appreciated it (ICS). </p>
<p> I am disappointed one thing on the ICS camera app does not support the turn off shutter sound, this will effect in some countries’ law. I would suggest to upgrade this camera sound shutter to give the users an opportunity to turn on/off. this will help a lot. </p>
<p> i have an unlocked gsm samsung galaxy which is NOT rooted…..it does not show the option of Inverted mode under Accessability,for which i am very keen….i am in India on Vodaphone network…please help dr ks ramamurthy </p>

<p> Enable Stereo Speaker Playback System-Wide in SONY Xperia Z2 – Guide </p>
<p> One of the best smartphones from SONY can now be tweaked to deliver best in class sound playback as Xperia Z2 Android smartphone comes with the set of stereo speakers. While Sony forgot to make the stereo playback system-wide for sounds such as the ringtones and notifications, here comes the fix from the XDA member which can make your smartphone smarter than before. There are other volume mods available to make both the stereo speakers work for the surround sound, but are not that effective as the one which we will be discussing. If in a case you don’t want to make use of the Volume boost option, olokos provides two variants of the mod: one of which option doesn’t come with this feature. </p>
<p> So before we check out on how you can actually make the sound output as stereo system wide, let’s check out the quick pre requisites before we slip into the detailed guide which will help you enable the stereo speaker playback system wide. </p>
<p> Procedure: </p>
<p> Make sure that your SONY Xperia Z2 Android phone is rooted. Download the “Root Checker” app from the Google PLAY Store and check on whether the device is rooted or not. This mod will only work on the devices which are rooted. </p>
<p> Assuming that your device is rooted, you now need to download one of the 2 options mentioned below in your computer and place the same in your device. </p>
<p> Power off your Xperia Z2 Android phone so that it can be entered in the Recovery mode. Power ON the device and when LED notification lights up, you need to press the Volume up and Volume down to enter the device in the recovery mode. </p>
<p> Just navigate the menu options to enter the device in the recovery mode. </p>
<p> Select “install zip from sd card” and then select the zip file which you have placed in the device. It will take around 4 -5 minutes to apply the zip file in your device. </p>
<p> Once done, select “go back” and choose the option of “reboot in normal mode” for rebooting the device normally. Please note that it may sometime take more than usual time for rebooting the device in the normal mode. </p>
<p> So there you go, you have now successfully listen to the system sounds in the stereo sound. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> How to Exclude Unwanted Images from Phone Gallery on Android </p>
<p> Gallery on your Android is the place where it shows the photos and videos present on your phone. It also picks up the images from audio albums, video albums and other folders which contains images of any sizes not necessarily being only the photos. For example if I have a complete audio album, it might include covers and the back photos of it. Now these images shows up in my Gallery into separate folder alongside with my pictures. Also the pictures from Picasa Web album are too shown here as well. It’s not a problem but it shows up in an annoying way everytime I visit Gallery. Android system checks SD card for new media files from time to time and these folders are added to the media database and there are displayed in the stock gallery. </p>
<p> Gallery Excluder is a dedicated Android application which removes the folders that you want to exclude its showing in the default Android stock version. This application is quite simple and does the job what it says with the application name. So if you have folders which you don’t wants to show it on your Gallery then install this application, select the folder which you want to show and done. </p>
<p> Gallery Excluder will list all the direct sub directories and directories in a list and if an item gets checked, a .nomedia file is placed in that directory and this makes it not to be seen on the Gallery folder. </p>
<p> How to Hide Unwanted Folder in Gallery </p>
<p> Follow the procedure below to hide unwanted photos folders – </p>
<p> Run the application once when it’s downloaded and installed. </p>

<p> Facebook 4.0 to bring Redesign, SMS reading and More – Features, APK Download </p>
<p> Facebook is soon going to push the update to the Facebook for Android application, and that would be the Facebook 4.0 which is coming with some big overhaul to the design and quite a lot of other changes. If you are in the beta group, you would already get a chance to check it out but if you are not, there is still an option – install the APK file. You still won’t be getting all the new features if you are installing this one. </p>
<p> The overhaul is not just to the news feed but even to the settings bar on the left and there is a new title banner added to the left of the action bar, and the same banner area has got a search bar, so you won’t need to go to the menu always to search for something. Just underneath to that is the main one – Five new icons with the options – </p>
<p> Pending friend requests </p>
<p> Status updates </p>
<p> Notifications </p>
<p> In the earlier versions of Facebook, and the current Facebook 3.9 version, there were just the three options for Status, Photo and Check-in but in the new version, you would see all these in the bottom, floating along so that you can access it anytime. The app permissions too would give you an idea of what all is going to happen new, and the new Facebook permissions that we see are – </p>
<p> Read your text messages (SMS or MMS) </p>
<p> Add or modify calendar events and send e-mail or guests without owners knowledge </p>
<p> Change the network connectivity </p>
<p> Connect and disconnect from Wi-Fi </p>
<p> It is Facebook’s wish on who can get the access to all the features already and I was lucky enough to get most of it, although I couldn’t get anything about the wallpaper or the SMS / MMS reading. The font changes were quite visible, with the menu having a thinner and way better look than the previous one, which looked thick and funkier. Head below to download the APK file of the Facebook 4.0.0.0.2 version. </p>
<p> Download Facebook 4.0.0.0.2 APK </p>
<p> The download link is below, and you might have to delete the current Facebook app and also turn off the automatic updating of the apps from Play Store because as soon as you install this, the Play Store might update it with the official current version, i.e. 3.9. </p>
<p> File name: com.facebook.katana-4.0.0.0.2.apk Facebook version: File name: 4.0.0.0.2 </p>

<p> Facebook Buys Messaging App WhatsApp for $19 Billion – Report, Details </p>
<p> That’s 19 times of what they paid for the popular Image sharing website Instagram. Yes, Facebook bought the very popular chat app WhatsApp for a whooping sum of $19 billion. Of which, $16 billion would be in cash and stock for the company ($12 billion worth of stock and $4 billion cash), while the other $3 billion would be in stock for the employees of WhatsApp. Whether this is a smart purchase or a blunder, would be found only when Mark Zuckerberg and others plan things out for it, but the Facebook CEO did mention that they won’t join the huge social network with this messaging service, and both will run independently. </p>
<p> On his Facebook wall, Mark Zuckerberg said: </p>
<p> I’m excited to announce that we’ve agreed to acquire WhatsApp and that their entire team will be joining us at Facebook. </p>
<p> Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. We do this by building services that help people share any type of content with any group of people they want. WhatsApp will help us do this by continuing to develop a service that people around the world love to use every day. </p>
<p> WhatsApp will continue to operate independently within Facebook. The product roadmap will remain unchanged and the team is going to stay in Mountain View. Over the next few years, we’re going to work hard to help WhatsApp grow and connect the whole world. We also expect that WhatsApp will add to our efforts forInternet.org, our partnership to make basic internet services affordable for everyone. </p>
<p> WhatsApp is being used by over 450 million people, and this database of actively connected people is what Mark would have in mind when purchasing WhatsApp. According to OnDevice Research, WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app for smartphones, and buying WhatsApp would strengthen the position of Facebook which is already in dominance against the other scarce social networks on the web. </p>
<p> Zuckerberg said that initially the team is looking for the growth of the app and not the revenue, and WhatsApp is charging $1 per year for the users, although I’m one of those who always saw the service time extended for a few months before I tried to pay the dollar for using the app. </p>
<p> In 2012, Facebook had acquired Instagram for $1 billion for the same reason – Growth and to keep the young users interested and involved not just in the photo sharing service but the social network Facebook. </p>
<p> What the users shouldn’t be worried about, is the integration or syncing, as WhatsApp is going to run in the same way as it always did, Independently. We will get into further details soon. </p>

<p> Facebook Launches the ‘Nearby Friends’ – Lets you Find your Friends Nearby – Details </p>
<p> Facebook has launched a new feature call the Nearby friends that lets your friends see how far are you from their place. For this you have to share your location initially. This feature lets you spend more time with your friends in directly instead of chatting or talking online. This feature will be hitting the Android and iOS devices in the US in few weeks. </p>
<p> This Nearby Friends was built by Glancee location sharing app team that is led by Andrea Vaccari. This app was acquired by Facebook back in 2012 and Nearby Friends adds a list of friends to Facebook’s app and it will be sending you notification if any of those friends in the list is in the nearby location. More over you can also share your precise location and all your friends will be able to see it on their maps so that they can spot you easily. </p>
<p> Andrea Vaccari said that – We have seen in the data that even though everybody was talking about social discovery, the data wasn’t corroborating that. It was the opposite, she also mentioned that the idea was to make it easy to discover your friends whenever someone is around so that you can meet up and spend some time also. </p>
<p> This feature will give you the privacy as you can ignore it and stop using it if you don’t want to and you can add as many friends on to the list that you want to know about and other cannot see the location. You can only see the location of your friend if both of you are turning on this feature since it uses the reciprocal privacy model. This is available only for people over the age of 18. </p>
<p> After you get the update of this Nearby friends, you will be getting their app list in Facebook navigation menu in the More option. From this menu you can turn on or turn off the Nearby friend and you can also select if you want to share you proximity with all your friends or just a specific friend list or group. </p>

<p> Facebook Uploaded 1.5M Users Email on its Site – Report </p>
<p> Recently Facebook has been criticized for many things regarding security and privacy reasons. Now according to a report, Facebook has unintentionally uploaded the email contacts of its 1.5 million new Facebook users since 2016. Already Facebook has been under scrutiny for many mishaps and a recent report suggested that the social network has spied on the users who have been paying $20 as part of their market research program. </p>
<p> Facebook claims that the email data had been uploaded unintentionally and it has been deleting them right away from the time it got notified about it. The data includes 1.5 million user’s contact which was reportedly used to improve Facebook as targeting. A spokesperson from Facebook has said that they have offered an option to verify their account and identity by giving away the email and password and this feature was removed later. </p>
<p> He also claims that Facebook has not collected or accessed any data from emails. Even though Facebook has been leaking so much data of its users and breaching the users’ privacy we have seen many users still actively using their Facebook accounts while many have already started moving to other social media accounts to be on the safe side. Facebook is claiming that it has already started to fix the latest issue and is also notifying the users whose contacts were imported. </p>
<p> Facebooks users can review and manage the contacts that they want to share from the settings of their account. It will be interesting to know how many of you still trust Facebook over its privacy and still wish to continue to use the social networking platform? How many of you have already moved to others?

<p> Face Off: Xperia Z Vs Galaxy S4 – Tabular Comparison of 25 Parameters </p>
<p> Samsung says hello to World with an all new Galaxy smartphone which is “Galaxy S4” and for all those SONY fans who are just waiting to decide on which one to choose from the latest flagship models from both the manufacturers then we will help you over a due course of this article to compare the same in terms of specs. SONY Xperia Z comes with the waterproof capability and sets a standard to come with a smartphone which not is a sleek, stylish and beautiful looking smartphone but also is a water resistant phone. Samsung too in MWC 2013 showcased such phone which is XCover 2 but looks way too sturdy which comes with the increased thickness and looks are not sleek from any angle. </p>
<p> So, to make things simple for you, we have tabulated the specifications of Samsung Galaxy S4 and SONY Xperia Z which are the current flagship models from Samsung and SONY respectively. </p>
<p> Built Quality, Look & Feel: Till the moment before Samsung Galaxy S4 was announced, SONY Xperia Z was one of the best smartphones not just in terms of looks but also with over all feel of the body but unfortunately Samsung Galaxy S4 has stolen all attraction and in fact has one of the best look and feel. Though Samsung Galaxy S4 might just give you the plasticky feel, the overall built quality is quite improved than that of Samsung Galaxy S3 and also of course with the SONY Xperia Z model. But over a period of time Samsung has improved and has introduced some metallic body in Galaxy S4. </p>
<p> Performance & Screen Quality: Samsung Galaxy S4 comes with the super speed Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 of processor while SONY Xperia Z comes with the Quad-core 1.5 GHz Krait processor which is slightly lower than that of Samsung Galaxy S4. When talked of Screen then both Samsung Galaxy S4 and SONY Xperia Z smartphones come with more over 5 inches of same screen size but Samsung’s S IV looks slightly brighter than the Xperia Z smartphone. Also, colors in Samsung Galaxy S IV looks more vivid than the former. </p>
<p> Memory: Unlike HTC One, SONY and Samsung both allows external memory SD Card slot extension. SONY allows you to make use of a maximum of 32GB while Samsung allows you to extend the memory by 64GB which is a great part. If you talk of RAM then both the smartphones, Xperia Z and Galaxy S4 comes with the 2GB of RAM. </p>
<p> 13 MP, 4128 x 3096 pixels, autofocus, LED flash. Dual Shot, Simultaneous HD video and image recording, </p>
<p> 13.1MP with 4128×3096 pixels, autofocus, LED flash </p>
<p> Battery Life: The biggest drawback of the SONY Xperia Z is the non-removable battery, just in case if the device gets stuck then there is no manner that you can restart the device till the battery drains completely. Samsung Galaxy S4 comes with the removable battery. If you talk of the battery life then Samsung Galaxy S4 comes with the 2600Mah while Xperia Z comes with the 2330 mAH of battery life. </p>
<p> Final Verdict: If you want a waterproof phone then it has to be Xperia Z but if you are looking to ride on the success of Galaxy series from Samsung and want to have a stylish device then it has to be a Galaxy S4. But, Uh! Did I tell you the pricing details of Samsung Galaxy S4 and SONY Xperia Z? Galaxy S4 price is still not known while Xperia Z costs around $700. </p>

<p> wrong info is given about Battery Life: of Sony xperia Z, As if it hangs it can restart by a pressing a specific key and as the battery life of xperia Z is more powerful because of STAMINA MODE </p>
<p> both phone have almost same features,although s4 has more features but price is more than xperia z? </p>
<p> When my Galaxy 2 was stolen, I upgraded to the Xperia Z. I was very pleased with it until I got it home. This was when I found out what several others have commented on – it can be lousy at picking up some WiFi signals. Mine is from a Sky set-up, and the phone had difficulty picking up a signal only 4 metres away. By the time I took it upstairs to the room above the modem, it picked up no signal at all. I took it back and got a Galaxy Note 2, which I am very happy with. </p>
<p> Too biased on Samsung. Galaxy s4. Picture quality and camera quality and sound Quality including display Is far better than the cheap. Plastic of Samsung Galaxy 4 . </p>
<p> Hassan I agree with you on the sound and maybe the feel although I don’t really like the feel of the Z but the picture quality??? All reviews and comparisons I have seen have put the S4 streets ahead in picture quality. So I ask…where does your info come from??? </p>
<p> The Sony xperia will take a 64gb sd card but must be formated in the phone. Leonard </p>

If you are one of them, well here is a simple way how you can do it. </p>

Users have to create a call event if they want to fake any of your friends. To create call events users need to provide the caller ID which is the phone number, name which will appear as the calling party and when the call should start. This is a good option and you are provided 5 seconds, 60 seconds, 5 minutes and 30 minutes. If you think that those time frames are not enough for you then you can use custom time and this application will show up a fake call at that time. Under the hood of it in the same option is the option of call type which is incoming, outgoing or miss call and finally you need to hit Create to enable settings for what you have done. </p>
<p> I have done one such here in the screenshot – And I received the fake call saying FBI India calling along with slide to answer and option to cut the call. It would have been better if the developer would have added some recorded message whenever some lifts the calls. Example like – ‘this was a fake call, you became fool’ or something like that, instead it ends with no voice when answered. </p>
<p> Just beside create there is another option of Shortcut which allows you to create a front shortcut on your smartphone which s only available for the Pro users. </p>
<p> Similar settings as those of call logs are available in message tab where you are shown the option of caller ID, name, time interval along with custom time and finally the message body to enter the message which you want to provide. Along with those there is the option of message option and show as unread or read option available too. When you are done click on Create. </p>
<p> Here is the one such fake message that I have created – </p>
<p> Here is one such message which I have received after creating a fake message event – </p>
<p> Fake Call & SMS Call Logs Download </p>
<p> Fake Call & SMS Call Logs can be downloaded to your phone via Android Apps Labs for free. To download this application directly on to your phone, you need to visit Fake Call application page and then tap on Install button to automatically install this app. </p>
<p> Final Verdict </p>
<p> If you want to fake your friends or colleagues around and wants to show that you are smart enough to be group leader then this application is worth for you. Miss usage of this application can cause problem in your relationship too, so this application should be used for entertainment purpose only. </p>

<p> Androidadvices.com has been very educative to me and I believe to others as well. Most of my firmware and ROM’s have been sourced here; good job. However, when you start marketing applications whose best value inclines to fraud a con games, for lack of better words, then you start losing it. In my honest opinion this particular opinion can only be used to lie to another person that they called or texted a number they didn’t. The joke value of this app measured against the potential to con or frame other people, pales in comparison </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> List of Features in Ice Cream Sandwich UI & Android OS </p>
<p> The Android Ice Cream Sandwich has been unveiled and there are certain features which are worth to discover on this Android update. As always the update of any version fixes the bugs from the previous version, the Android Ice Cream Sandwich has does that and also has new features founded at every fold of Android interface. </p>
<p> Here is the confirmed overview of Android Ice Cream Sandwich i.e., Android 4.0 accordingly with the user interface and looks. </p>
<p> Home Screen </p>
<p> The Ice Cream Sandwich homescreen mostly gets the Honeycomb equivalent interface. You can now swipe any apps away to close it. As Android is for open source, the quick links on the bottom of the screen are up for user based customization which includes app folder. Noticeably the app folder gets smoother creation and animations are pretty amazing. </p>
<p> Notification Bar </p>
<p> The Ice Cream Sandwich notification bar is just like the Honeycomb interface that we have seen on the tablets. The notification bar now will allow the users to swipe away the notifications individually with swipe to remove instead of normal clear button that we saw until now. The notification bar now can be lowered directly from the lockscreen too. </p>
<p> Camera </p>
<p> Google has made a big effort to improve both camera and the video recording with the new OS. The addition to the camera app is the continuous focus, selective focus, zooms while recording videos, 1080p HD video recording and it would also include an enhanced video editor. </p>
<p> Lock Screen with Face Recognition Unlock </p>
<p> Certainly the coolest feature is the new lockscreen in which forward facing camera can be set to unlock the screen with single user face. This provides the seamless and effortless unlocking of the device. </p>
<p> Default Browser </p>
<p> The default browser in Android would also get a face lift with a crucial feature which would compete with third party browsers. The browser is faster and provides stability improvements and allows easy access to full website than the default mobile view. Now also save the pages for the offline reading and there is option of auto sync of bookmarks with your Google Chrome installed. </p>
<p> Data Usage Feature </p>
<p> The Data usage feature present in the Settings will clearly display the graph of what is using your data consumption. You can also set data limit on your Gmail Sync, browser data use and over all limit. Learn more about Data Usage in Ice Cream Sandwich. </p>
<p> NFC </p>
<p> Near Field Communication is taking its shape into reality and no other phone than the Samsung Galaxy Nexus would be the better device to test out NFC. Along with Galaxy Nexus there are other handsets like Galaxy S II which now comes with pre-installed NFC Chip. With Ice Cream Sandwich OS phones, NFC module would be made available to all the handsets running this version. </p>
<p> Android Beam </p>
<p> Android Beam is the feature in Samsung Galaxy Nexus which uses NFC technology to quickly share webpages, videos, apps, pictures and even Google Maps that you are browsing on your phone with the nearby phone. We have just gone through broad explanation of Android Beam and share content. </p>

<p> Will Ice Cream Sandwich be available for Samsung galaxy ace? or soon?. now am using andriod 2.3.6 gingerbeard. </p>
<p> Since Samsung is rolling out ICS officially, I am using Galaxy S2 I91000G and i still dont see official ICS update for my phones, does Non G version will get its update or not? if Yes, when can we expect the ICS update? </p>
<p> when will i be able to upgrade my samsung galaxy mini S5570 to android 4.0 ??????????????/ </p>
<p> I would like to know if Galaxy SII i9100G will be getting official ICS update? Since Samsung has stopped shipping i9100 and selling only i9100G. </p>
<p> I am using SII i9100G and would like to know of ICS update as i m very curious, If yes, when will i be getting update? </p>
<p> i this table on another page u say that samsung galaxy s 1 will not get any isc 4.0 upgrade!! </p>
<p> whereas while going through some other pages on your site i see you telling other people that it will get android 4.0 upgrade!!! </p>
<p> could you pls clarify what is going to happen nt was is nt going to happen!!!????? </p>
<p> There is difference in Stock firmware and custom (third party) firmware. Android 4.0 custom firmware will be available for Galaxy S and it was expected to for official update but Samsung pulled out updating it. It was of the custom (unofficial) one that we were talking about. </p>
<p> Thanks Neal. Though what do you mean unofficially? Bare with me as i am new to this. </p>
<p> I was having a read though this (http://androidadvices.com/samsung-galaxy-gt-i9000-steps-install-ice-cream-sandwich-android-40-alpha-firmware/) article on how to upgrade to the ICS Alpha version and see that it is specifically for the Samsung Galaxy S GT i9000 I also do see the disclaimer on how it should not be followed for a i9000t. Ive noticed that a lot of the aritcles you have on your site are for only the Galaxy S GT i9000 and no other similar models like the i9000t. </p>
<p> So what about the i9000t? Would I be able to use the same articles to update the device? Having done some research on the net I found that some fourms are saying using the i9000 ROMs work on the i9000t. I dont know if this would apply also to OS updates. </p>
<p> On Wikipedia i found this (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S) where the i9000t models form factor is identical to the GT-I9000, not really sure on what this means, but would it mean that the phone is indeed identical to the GT-I9000? </p>
<p> I havent actually purchased the i9000t as yet, but am thinking about it as these models work best for where I am currently located (The Bahamas). </p>
<p> Unofficially is means not from the company manufacturer and so its from the third party. </p>
<p> Identical phones of Galaxy GT I9000 are different from its original ones and we have mentioned clearly that for which phones what firmware is applicable. </p>
<p> Surely we will publish an article if there is any custom firmware available for i9000t. </p>
<p> What about the Samsung galaxy S i9000T? Would it be available for this model as well? </p>
<p> did ice cream os avilable for samsung galaxy fit gt5670…if have pls send download link to my mail…thnx.. </p>
<p> as of now its not there, but once it arrives we will surely come up with the procedure! </p>
<p> Fingers Crossed, I really hope that I will be able to download it from Android Advices, Odin version. Kies Sucks big time. Neal, we are counting on you and the Android Advices Team for the Galaxy S2 ICS. Cheers. </p>
<p> Will icecream sandwich will be available for galaxy ace 55830, Samng galaxy s I9000 and Galaxy sl 19903. </p>
<p> yes for some phones it will be available via through respective PC Suites and while some of them via Odin and other flash tools! </p>
<p> When Ice Cream Sandwich OS comes for samsung galaxy mini or galaxy pop or samsung s5570. </p>
<p> Ah, the gap between the Samsung and Apple, will still be narrowed down. Good, the customer is the beneficiary. </p>

<p> Few Major Carriers in US facing Lawsuit over Selling Location Data of Users </p>
<p> A few of the major US carriers are facing a class action lawsuit over the allegations on selling their user’s location data to low-level law enforcement and bounty hunters. The major carriers that are named in the lawsuit are AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon, which is a result of an investigation from Motherboard, The New York Times, and office of Senator Ron Wyden. The case has been filed which seeks damages that are unspecified and will be determined at the trial. </p>
<p> The investigation report from Motherboard showed that AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile has allowed a network middlemen companies to access the user’s real-time location which was used to track who ever they wanted to from these networks. In 2018, New York Times has also provided a report which says that the four carriers have given data to Securus, which allowed low-level law enforcement to locate phones of citizens without a warrant. </p>
<p> According to the complaint, these carriers have failed to implement their own privacy policy by allowing these third-party companies access to the customers CPI (Confidential Proprietary Information) and CPNI (Confidential Proprietary Network Information). CPNI has included location data particularly allowing whoever it is to track an individual. According to Section 222 of the Federal Communications Act (FCA) selling access to the data is a violation and is the central focus of the class action suit. </p>
<p> On the other hand, Z Law, a consumer protection law firm has also filed the lawsuit and covers an approximated number of customers each of telcos has from April 30, 2015, to Feb 15, 2019. For Verizon, AT&T the numbers cover 100 million each while for T-Mobile and Sprint it is 50 million each. As of now, nothing is known what are the financial damages for each customer which should be decided when it reaches trial. </p>
<p> After the reports, AT&T and T-mobile said that they have stopped the selling of location data while Sprint has promised will be stoping it by the end of May this year. There has been no official word from these carriers regarding the lawsuit as of now. On which network are you on? Do you think even your location data was sold? Comment in the section below an stay tuned to Android Advices for more. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Best File Manager for Android with Direct Root Folder Access – ES File Explorer </p>
<p> Most of the smartphones come with a default file manager, which is quite decent to use for that particular smartphone or tablet device but there are many situations where you wanted to have more access to the files and play around with the file system (only if you are quite an expert with it), and these pre-loaded file manager don’t allow you to do so. The best part that we already mention here – File and application managing, task killer and cloud storage client which is compatible with several cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Skydrive and a few others. </p>
<p> The ES File Explorer works for all the smartphones running the Android 2.1 and later, but the ES App Group has a different Cupcake version of this file explorer for the devices which are running Android 1.5, 1.6 and 2.0 versions. The languages supported by the app are quite a lot: English, Russian, Japanese, French, Spanish, German, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Dutch, Italian, Hebrew, Vietnamese, Slovak, Czech, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Tamil, Catalan, Turkish, Lithuanian, Portuguese(pt), Portuguese(br). </p>
<p> Let me guide you through the various features of the app with the screenshots to make it easier to understand for a first time user, who might not see a system folders in their device. </p>
<p> The user can select the root folder as either the Device root or the SD card, and there is a history which shows the recently browsed folders in the file system. The folders like sys, system, vendor, spdata, root might be seen only when the root access is available, i.e. if the device is rooted. Or else, you will be getting the direct access to only the public folders and to the SD card. </p>
<p> There is a fast access menu that can be pulled in from the left screen corner, and it has got an access to several things – Favorite, Local, Library, Network and Tools and each of it has again got sub menus. The tools included are: </p>
<p> SD Card Analyst </p>
<p> These would be more than enough for a user who always finds it hard to roam around the settings and manage the various applications in the smartphone, and to check how the storage in the SD card is. The network settings include the LAN, Cloud, FTP and Bluetooth. the FTP connection options show how good the app is, for users to do a lot more than just managing the files and folders in the smartphone. The library would again help the user go through all the files of a particular file type, i.e. into pictures, music, movies and books. </p>
<p> Settings: There’s a load of it. You don’t need to go through each of it and play around if you are looking for just the normal file management. These would be divided into: </p>
<p> Display settings which brings in the settings to show or hide the hidden files, close the notification when a task is finished, show the scroll the thump, the windows button and the name on the toolbar. There is an option to even show / hide the SD card size as well as the space low warning. </p>
<p> Cleanup settings would do a nice job of clearing the history of what you did when exiting the app, and the cache clearing can also be done. </p>
<p> The other settings include the password settings, and the various things one could do to manage the applications in the Android phone. </p>
<p> Password settings: You can protect the app with a password, so that one has to enter the password to access the file explorer. There is even network protection option, so that the network resources are protection, and also to protect the hide list. </p>
<p> App Manager: Before uninstalling an app, the user can choose to backup the app, and there is a separate directory for the app backups. When the device is rooted, the ES File Explorer gives and extra option of uninstalling the apk automatically. </p>
<p> There are a lot of other options out of the settings area too, and that includes the default windows setting where one can set the Home, Device, Sdcard, Picture, Music, Movie, Book, Download or any of the folder to open directly. There are several view options too, and people can create new files and folders anywhere in the directory. </p>
<p> This ES File Explorer app is available for free on the Play Store, and it unarguably one of the best file manager and explorers for the Android smartphones. This could very well compete against several other free or paid file explorers, and the default file managers aren’t mostly anything when you talk of the features included. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> How to Filter Play Store Apps to Find the Right Applications on Android </p>
<p> As the number of apps keep increasing everyday on the Play Store, users are discovering more and more applications and games for their Android Smartphone. However, with over 450,000 apps and counting, it is tough to find the apps we need and get them from the market. Here at Androidadvices, we found a few tips for Android users which would help them to filter apps and sort them out for quick reference and access. </p>
<p> Tip 1 : Apply the minus ‘ – ‘ symbol while searching </p>
<p> While you are doing a search in the Android Play Store, add the minus symbol at the end of your search term followed by the words which you do not want. For example, if a user is searching for Angry Birds, there are a lot of other themes and ringtones that come after or before the actual app you are looking for. In this case, you could use the tip. </p>
<p> For example, type this in the search box : ” Angry Birds -Ringtone -Theme -Wallpapers ” </p>
<p> This will make the search much more effective as the results will not show anything from the wallpapers, ringtones and the themes category shortlisting what you probably just want. This method will save a lot of time while searching for not-so-popular apps on the Play Store. </p>
<p> Tip 2 : Use the Web version of the Play Store </p>
<p> Using the Play Store on the Web needs a internet enabled computer which can run the browser and it might not be of much convenience, indeed. However, it also turns out to be one of the best and easiest ways of finding the app you want. Especially, if you’re looking for multiple apps in one category or just setting up your new Android phone, it would be of really good use. </p>
<p> When you are signed in on your Android device and the Play Store over the web, the apps start getting downloaded and installing automatically on your Android phone, at any location it may be wirelessly provided it’s connected to the internet. It’s a very useful feature and helps as one does not have to go through the menus in the small screen and choose apps one by one. </p>
<p> Also, there are multiple search options on the Google Play store on the Web like Sorting by Relevance, filtering by paid/free etc </p>
<p> You may use these tips to make your app search on the Android Play Store much more efficient and easier, by helping you save time and also giving results more accurately as you want. </p>

<p> Thank you!! Perfect. your instruction and information is perfect. Short and sweet and right on the mark….. </p>
<p> This wasn’t very helpful…at all. In fact, at the end, I had the same exact screen as the last screen shot in your article. However, from there what? So what IS my Android version? Is Firmware the name of my Android version? There is no “Android version” written on the screen… Bear in mind that if somebody doesn’t know their Android’s version, its probably because he/she doesn’t know much about phones to begin with. So please don’t take for granted that we already know what’s what. Actually “Here our requirement was to find the Android operating system version and so you can find it at this point of time. ” was a pretty shitty ending sentence. It just left me hanging…frustrated. </p>

<p> How to Find Wifi Password with Android Phone – Network SSID </p>
<p> Call it as out of curiosity or hacking, in this article we will be guiding you on how you can find the password for the Network SSID with the help of your Android smartphone. Though we don’t believe in supporting hackers but it’s just an eye opener to you that simple passwords might are more prone to hacking. To ensure that this trick works or to make use of the same, you will have to first up ensure that your Android phone is rooted. To check on whether your device is rooted or not, you will have to download the “Root Checker” app from the Google PLAY Store. </p>
<p> Tip: Just in case if your device is not rooted, then you can do let us know in the comments section about the same so that we can guide you to the rest of the process for rooting your Android device. </p>
<p> Procedue to Find Wifi Password with Android Phone – Network SSID </p>
<p> Assuming that you have rooted your device, head over to the Google PLAY Store to download an app called “Root Browser Lite (free)” app. </p>
<p> Once you have downloaded the app, open the same and navigate to the Data/misc/wifi folder to find the wpa_supplicant.conf file for opening the same. </p>
<p> Now, with the help of “RD Text Editor” you will have to open the conf file. Please note that it’s not necessary that you will have to make use of RD Text Editor but any text editor can be employed for the same. </p>
<p> Now, you will see that a list of data mentioning about various detais will be listed, so you now need to navigate to the “SSID” row in the name of Wi Fi network and then the “PSK” row will show the password of that particular Wi Fi connection. </p>
<p> Tip: To ensure that your Wi Fi connection password is not hacked, you need to ensure that the MAC based security is enabled in your MODEM which is in fact the toughest to crack. </p>

<p> Thanks for android advice. I’ve been rooted my galaxy s advance with xxld1 firmware using odin software. </p>
<p> This only shows pass codes you have entered and saved in your device. It doesn’t show you ones you didn’t enter. Odds are if you entered it, you know it already. </p>
<p> Good instructions, I found the password as described. However, the passwords were already known since I added them to my network at home and at work. This is good for recovering a forgotten password if you can still access the network. How can I “rediscover” a lost password if I change phones. </p>
<p> Simple if you have any other wifi and you login to your google account it should sync </p>

<p> Firmware Upgrade & Downgrade Steps for Galaxy S I9000 Version </p>
<p> With so many android versions, the new Android users may get sometimes get confused on with which version you need to update. So, today let’s check out what are these firmwares and what does it signify and how these firmwares can be updated. Many of the readers have asked the question quite a few sometimes that why the firmwares star with the letters “XX”, basically all the European firmware builds are denoted with X at the beginning and these builds are quite stable and are very fast compared to stock builds which are released in other countries. The second most question asked is why is being PIT file advised to use it as mentioned in the post, here i would like to clarify that some of the firmwares comes with the flexibility to use the PIT file be it PIT 512 or PIT 802 while most of the firmwares come with the advisory that you need to use that particular PIT only. </p>
<p> So, now let’s check out how you can downgrade the version if you have updated your version with any of the versions like XXJPU, XXJPY, XWJS3, XWJS5, XWJS7 or even XWJV1. Always note that whenever you are crossing over the versions like from 2.2.1 to 2.3.2 or from 2.2 to 2.2.1 its necessary to upgrade the firmware via Odin using all the 3 files that is PDA + Phone + CSC along with PIT or else the phone will not be updated with the version. And also note that always ensure that you are flashing the firmware in the download mode, if you don’t flash the firmware in the download mode then there is a high possibility that you may brick the phone and make it unusable for future use. Download mode acts like a Safe mode for your phone, so always flash the firmware only in “Download Mode”. If your device refuses to enter into the download mode then you need to follow the Procedure to fix the download mode in your Galaxy S GT I9000 to solve the bug in some of the handset batch. The download mode screen looks like this, </p>
<p> If you are moving within the versions like in 2.2.1 from XXJPU to XXJPY, then you can flash the XXJPY firmware version just by selecting “PDA and PIT file”. There is no need to add the options like Phone and CSC unless and until there is any custom made Modem (Phone) has been added in the version of the firmware. </p>
<p> Also most importantly ensure that in Odin never tick the “Re-Partition” , “DUMP” and “Debug En.” option, while ensure that “Auto Reboot” and “F. Reset Time” options are ticked before proceeding to flash the firmware on your device. </p>
<p> To downgrade you need to follow the below instructions, </p>
<p> If you are on the latest XWJV1 2.3.2 version and wish to move to 2.2.1 version, then you will have to first flash your phone with XXJPU 2.2.1(three file version that is PDA + Phone + CSC along with PIT) version and then you can move on to XXJPY, XWJS5 or even XWJS7. </p>
<p> If you are on any of the 2.2.1 version like if you are on XWJS7, XWJS5 or even XXJPY then you can directly follow the procedures which are mentioned in our blog “androidadvices.com” which can be found using the search function in our website. </p>
<p> Apart from this if you come across any of the issues or problems while flashing your Android device then we will be happy to help you anytime. </p>

<p> HI, i bought my galaxy s from UK with the product key ending in XEU,it had eclair and in december i updated it via kies in romania(cause i live here) to froyo 2.2.1 As i couldn’t wait for the oficial realease(don’t ask me why,curiosity maybe),using ODIN i instaled Gingerbread XWJVB 2.3.3 Firmware made public by NEAL PRADEEP here How To Update Samsung Galaxy S I9000 to stable Gingerbread XWJVB 2.3.3 Firmware | Android Advices ,his explanations were verry clear and helpfull and the phone works good, seems to me a little more faster.Thing is i found out that Vodafone UK realeased the official gingerbread version and i would like to get that. The questions i try to find answers for are: 1.How can i get back to an older version of software(wich one?,wich are the steps?) to be able to update via kies with the official realease 2.Will i be able to do this in romnia(cause i managed without any efort to get 2.2.1 via kies while phones bought in romania from orange,vodafone and cosmote had to wait till recent days to get 2.2.1,this makes me think i will be able to get the release from vodafone uk but not verry sure about this)? thank you for you answers in anticipation! </p>
<p> @ostas daniel as of now vodafone didn’t launch Gingerbread 2.3.3 for its users but as soon as it launches we will surely guide you on how you can update your phone! </p>
<p> @Nuaym, Juz like you, mine got a hp+pc screen pops out! BRICKED!! Using xxjpy 3 files though~ Reflash back to 2.3.2, Lucky my device back to life…. </p>
<p> I just chose the one for 803 PIT in samfirmware.com, and flashed it using ODIN3, and now it turns on and stuck at the S icon, i have no idea what to flash with to fix it.. </p>
<p> I just realised it should be 512 but the thing is there is only 1 file, and I flashed my phone with 803 PIT before..wonder what should i do.. </p>
<p> Thanks Neal, just a quick question, should I use the 512 PIT or 803 ? Because when I upgraded to 2.3.2,I used the 803. My understanding is that I should use the 512. Thanks again for your help! </p>
<p> Hi, just wondering can i go back from XWJV1 2.3.2 straigh to ZSJPJ 2.2.1 ? does it have to go back to XXJPU 2.2.1 first? thanks </p>
<p> @Nuaym yes you can go to ZSJPJ version but it should have 3 files + PIT as you are shifting the version! </p>
<p> @Danny re partition needs three files + the PIT in any firmware. Its very dangerous if you select the pit file and re partition with one file then your device will be dead or failed. You can try it if you want. </p>

<p> To make sure that your Cache does not get piled up again you can even Schedule Reminders to clear your cache to remind you when the Cache reaches a certain amount of size or to remind you in certain time interval, which is very easy as seen in the image below. </p>
<p> You can also schedule the App to “Auto Clear All Cache” at certain interval of time by clicking on the 3 dot icon on right side top of screen > Settings > Scroll down and click on “Auto Clear Interval” and set the desired time limit for Auto clearing cache in scheduled intervals. </p>
<p> Clearing Cache is the best way to clear memory as Cache is the temporary storage (caching) of web documents, such as HTML pages and images, to reduce bandwidth usage, server load, and perceived lag. A cached file stores copies of documents passing through it. </p>

<p> My phone is a Lenovo A7000 and its a kit-kat version No matter how small the app is, the bug still appears, even though my internal still has 200 MB and SD Card 1 GB </p>
<p> my phone is samsung galaxy s4 it is rooted an i’ve installed cyanogenmod 12 based on lolipop it was going well but then one day i tried to install apk of sbgame hacker and it says out of space . and till now i am getting this error whenever i try to install any kind of apk file but i can install any app from play store but it is not allowing to install apk files please help . anyone ? </p>
<p> I HAVE TRIED ALL THE PROCESS YOU CLEARLY STATED, IT DIDNT WORK, I HAVE 1GB INTERNAL SPACE AND 13GB SD, I STILL HAVE THE INSUFFICIENT STORAGE SPACE ERROR, I TRIED INSTALLING TO SD, SAME ERROR, EVEN WHEN I TRY TO UPDATE. I TRIED ROOTING BUT IT WONT ROOT. PLEASE I’M GETTING FRUSTRATED ALREADY, ANY REAL HELP PLSSSS. </p>
<p> This has been figured out, it’s not the app cache at fault with 4.4.2 really. </p>
<p> Duplicate entrys of directories are made in /data/app-lib </p>
<p> The lower numbered duplicate directory has to be deleted to clear the problem. Android can’t handle it correctly thus throwing the error, “insufficient storage available” </p>
<p> Cache is not the main culprit in the insufficient storage issue. Even the geeks have no solution as we can all see from Google searches. Cache cleaning IS NOT the solution! If you are rooted and are comfy with reinstalling your ROM fresh. That is the solution. </p>
<p> Your tip may help SOME times, but this will not eliminate “Insufficient Storage Error” all the time, this screw up happens mostly when trying to use app to send files or apps to your external SD, and thus will begin a moment of frustration( those who have experienced this know what I mean) So,I just want you to know that this will not always take care of this SOB “error” </p>

<p> Fix Android Market Apps Download Unsuccessful Error </p>
<p> The Android Market while you are browsing on your phone may sometime can bring out some errors. The chances that you get errors is very much less about 1%. If you have encountered any errors while you are in the Android Market, like errors of ‘Download Unsuccessful’ then here is how you can make sure that this errors doesn’t come again and again – </p>
<p> In your phone click on Menu and then tap on Settings.Now in the various Settings options, tap on ApplicationThis is the place to manage all the application which have been installed on your phone. You can view running apps, manage them and delete them too. But you need to click on Manage Applications.Now tap on the Market option available under the Manage applications. </p>
<p> Now you need to select Clear Cache to the cache of what you have searched on your phone in the Android Market. </p>
<p> You also need to clear the Browser cache and any other cookies, along with Google Apps, Google Talk and other checkin services. Once you have done that check back if the Android Market is working perfect and also check are you able to download applications successfully or not? This trick will work on any Android mobile phone regardless you have the Gingerbread or Froyo or Ice Cream Sandwich installed on you phone. </p>

<p> Sometimes you might creep in with some astonishing problems on your Android mobile phone and one of them is not able to connect your phone over Wi-Fi. The problem maybe not in your phone but can other issues which you aren’t aware of. It noted that 90 % such problems occur due to router configuration problem. And here is our basic guide on how would you resolve those issue by yourself. </p>
<p> We would be going with the basic steps to ensure that the problem is fixed by you manually. Follow the steps below – </p>
<p> Switch your mobile handset and reinsert battery and try again. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t work and if you are using security on Wi-Fi router then remove it. Check back again. </p>
<p> Some of the devices don’t supports router which is supported by other devices. So in that case you need to go to router configuration in PC and check each setting which your mobile needs. </p>
<p> If the problem is still not solved then follow these – </p>
<p> Use Fix My Wi-Fi – Using this paid Android App you can resolve some of the known Wi-Fi issues. The problem can be in failing to reconnect or return to access point, Wi-Fi dropping when idle(Optional Wi-Fi lock), device not attempting to connect. This app comes free with certain HTC mobile phones. Its available at Price of $3 or Rs 145. You can get this app for download at Marketplace. </p>
<p> If the paid app doesn’t work then it might be driver failure. For Samsung Galaxy series mobile phones open your keypad and type *#*#526#*#*, wait for some time until you see ‘process was successful’ on the screen. You can repeat this whenever you see this problem. </p>

<p> I have the Nexus S and I used to have connectivity issues too. It worked for like an hour like a charm and all of sudden, although connected to the home wi-fi I couldnt access the internet. </p>
<p> The problem seems to be the proper security protocol. The Nexus and some other cell phones (even non-android) dont seem to work properly using WPA or WPA2 for some enigmatic reason. So I changed the security protocol to WEP in my router. It works like a charm ever since. </p>
<p> I think the problem is not with your phones but with the router setting. Try lower to B/G instead of N. I’ve an old Desire and a new Nexus, both have no issues at my work place but have difficulties to access the Internet though connected until I change to B/G. </p>
<p> not able to connect wireless router asking for a wep key .even the key i have is correct which works in laptop i have </p>

I trying using wifi fix, it was unsucceful. I tried loading back the driver (*#*#526#*#*)also says unsuccesful.. What should i do now? </p>

<p> You really make it seem really easy together with your presentation but I find this topic to be actually one thing which I feel I would by no means understand. It seems too complex and extremely broad for me. I am looking forward on your next publish, I will try to get the dangle of it! </p>

<p> I had problem with my Galaxy S2 w-fi. When I start the wi-fi it doesn’t connect and turn-off wi-fi or in most cases the wi-fi not turn-off. Today I read your comment and apply the sequence *#*#526#*#* and the problem was fixed, the wi-fi backs work again. </p>
<p> i had the same problem on samsung s2. i went into the router page using the browser and turned off dhcp server and then back on. now working. netcomm router. </p>
<p> I solved the problem with the wlan error on Samsung Ace S5830 and a Samsung mini S5570 using the thread below and comment by b1gg: http://androidforums.com/samsung-galaxy-mini-s5570/409463-samsung-galaxy-mini-wifi-issue.html Basically root your 2.3.* phone with update.zip, reboot and then past in the file wpa_supplicant (over exsting file) in system/bin, reboot again and it should work. Sometimes the codes 562 or 232339 are needed. </p>
<p> Hi I have got a Samsung galaxy ace – and whenever I try to access wifi it say’s it connecting authenticating and then disabled this keeps happening in a loop – I have tried </p>
<p> open your keypad and type *#*#526#*#*, wait for some time until you see ‘process was successful’ on the screen. You can repeat this whenever you see this problem – This says it has worked but still no joy connecting wifi </p>
<p> “forget this network” (your preferred network or home network in my case). Shut off the phone and remove the battery for at least thirty seconds. Press the power button, with the battery still out, to help discharge the circuitry. Put the battery pack back in and then reconnect to your network as a new client. It appears the problem is from a corrupt IP/DNS configuration that must be rewritten. </p>

<p> This weekend I upgraded to Android 4.0.3 and I had to plug in a new router, funny enough on the same day. Since then my phone has been having difficulty accessing wi-fi. It just doesn’t DO anything, at all. It doesn’t load it doesn’t care. The wifi shows my router, I have entered the new password, but it just doesn’t connect. Yesterday I got it to work by turning off my router first, but if I leave my house and for whatever reason turn off my wi-fi and switch to 3G on my phone before I come back home: can’t connect AGAIN. I really don’t know if this is because of my Android update or because of my router… Help? </p>
<p> I had a problem with a HTC Ace (Desire HD, Inspire, etc.) and solved it by doing a factory data reset. Not intuitive, but it worked. </p>
<p> You understand therefore significantly on the subject of this topic, made me individually consider it from a lot of various angles. Its like men and women are not involved unless it is something to accomplish with Woman gaga! Your individual stuffs outstanding. Always handle it up! </p>
<p> Finally it is a easy quick fix. Just downgrade your wifi router everything will work fine. Just change the security of wifi router from wpa2 to wep and downgrade wireless interface fro 802.4 /g/f/n to just /g/f that means 130 mpbs to 54 mbps. No wounder everything will just start work. The thing is not all android versions are coded for advanced wifi technologies. </p>
<p> have just received android ics on my htc sensation. and after installing it.. my device wont to see my wifi network.. so sad please help me </p>

<p> Hi I have the same problem with my Samsung Galaxy Gio s5560 in Wi-Fi connection. My Android version is 2.2 froyo. Earlier, I could connect to Wi-Fi and it worked so well. I’ve not connected to Wi-Fi since yesterday. I’ve tried to press the code that I got from this website *#*#526#*#* and it said “Driver loading successful” but I can’t still connect to Wi-Fi. So I don’t know what to do now? I need some advices from you. Thank you in advance. </p>
<p> I have a Galaxy Ace that out of the box came with 2.3.4. I recently revert my phone to factory state (still 2.3.4) and this WiFi error came up. Is it possible the phone had a fix applied to it in the factory that was not in the reset image? </p>
<p> Also, my router does not have a firmware update available ;_; </p>
<p> hi, i have a htc sensation Z710e. some time ago i updated it to android 4.0.3 and now it doesn’t get connected to wifi. it has difficulty finding networks and after finding them, it can’t get connected. pls guide me. thanks </p>
<p> Guys, update your router’s firmware from its site and also *#*#526#*#* run this code. It helped me connect to wifi as of now. *Fingers crossed* </p>
<p> i have a galaxy ace s5830 an when i try accessing Google search web page o site the following page comes up stating that “the webpage in unavailable” and my Samsung app is working an play store is working properly </p>
<p> hey guys, well if the wifi shows u as error when u try to on your wifi .is it the driver failure. </p>
<p> I live in a boarding house which might explain wifi restrictions and security. Nevertheless, i can connect to the wifi but cannot browse any webpages. Any advise to overcome this? </p>
<p> my fix (from the internet): select “forget this network” (your preferred network or home network in my case). Shut off the phone and remove the battery for at least thirty seconds. Press the power button, with the battery still out, to help discharge the circuitry. Put the battery pack back in and then reconnect to your network as a new client. It appears the problem is from a corrupt IP/DNS configuration that must be rewritten. </p>
<p> Thank you so much for posting this. It actually works on my samsung galaxy y duos. </p>
<p> Hello, my wifi does not also have a samsung galaxy ace.Skúsil I enter the code * # * # 526 # * # * but wrote me, driver loading unsuccessful,. So what do I do now? </p>
<p> i have had the same problem since using different mobile hotspots away in another country. when i returned home, i was presented with this problem. Has anyone actually reset their router to refresh the wifi connections? </p>
<p> can u plz send the apn setting? my galaxy gio connects well with wifi i am able to use opera 6.5 n whatsup only. when i use mxit, youtube, android market it shows “unable to connect to the server” actually whats this server by the way? </p>
<p> the wifi on my i9100 doesnt not work, i’ll being serching solutions on the internet but i cant find anything , the wifi doesn’t turn on and after time lock my smartphone , i type *#*#526#*#* and it shows “notset Driver Loaded [ng]”, maybe it’s a hard issue? </p>
<p> OK, EVERYONE…DON’T THROW YOUR PHONES OUT JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE HAVING A TOUGH TIME CONNECTING TO A NETWORK. IF YOUR NETWORK IS AT HOME, THEN YOU NEED TO UPDATE YOUR ROUTER’S FIRMWARE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE A LINKSYS ROUTER, YOU WILL NEED TO FIND OUT THE MAKE AND MODEL OF YOUR ROUTER, THEN GO TO THEIR WEBSITE, DOWNLOAD THE CORRECT FIRMWARE TO YOUR COMPUTER, THEN GO INTO YOUR ROUTER SETTINGS, CLICK ON UPDATE FIRMWARE, THEN CLICK ON THE NEWLY DOWNLOADED FILE…AND WALLA!!! PROBLEM WILL BE SOLVED. THAT’S HOW I FIXED IT FOR MY SONY ERICSSON XPERIA ON ANDROID GINGERBREAD. NOW IT WORKS!!! GIVE IT A TRY BEFORE YOU GIVE UP, LIKE I ALMOST DID…SORRY FOR ALL CAPS, TRYING TO MAKE A POINT. (MIKE) </p>

<p> I finally seem to have fixed my problem by installing Wifi Analyzer to see what channels were strongest for my router (changed from 1 to 11), installed WiFi Buddy, and now it’s working, connection works even after the tab has gone into sleep mode and I wake it up. Going on 2 hours straight with no issues and am crossing my fingers! Thanks for the suggestions and I hope this helps someone else out there! </p>

<p> hi my Samsung galaxy gio wi fi is not work and i try the numbers it still did not work. </p>
<p> i’ve been struggling with wireless connections for months and thought it was something i just had to deal with. none of my apps would connect over wi-fi and i was forced to swap between my home network to 4g to send or receive emails! your fix worked instantly (samsung infuse 4g on rogers). bookmarked. </p>
<p> Phone: LG-P500 on Android 2.3.3 (Kernel 2.6.35.10-perf) Problem: it fails after authenticating with the router when “Obtaining IP address…” and then after 15 sec switches to “Remembered” before immediately switching to “Disabled” Router used to work with phone on 2.2.1 (although it would disconnect regularly and require me to turn wifi off then on again to re-establish wifi connection). Router works with PCs, iPod Touch, and iPad with no problem. </p>
<p> My Samsung GT-S5670 shows that there is one SMS but I when I check the SMS inbox there is no message but till shows one number of message in home screen. </p>
<p> I got the Samsung Galaxy Ace on Orange last month, and it keeps disconnecting from my wifi at home…Is there anyway i can fix this? </p>
<p> i have Atrix and problems with wifi . Now its 2.3.6 and wifi sometimes is on and can view neibours after that its rebooting. What should i do ? </p>
<p> i am having galaxy ace white 2.3 gingerbread…….. everything works fine except for the wifi. if i am connected using a wifi, after using it for some time it will lose connection and then reconnects it again. it works again for some more time then loses connection and reconnects. is this a problem with the mobile? </p>
<p> I have also experienced wireless connection issue in my Samsung infuse 4g in that my phone is unable to connect to my wireless router which is perfectly fine for my laptop. While restarting the phone works, I found another work around that doesn’t require a restart – go to your wifi settings and press wps button connection. You will see something happening in the background. Press Cancel button and you’ll see your ssid listed under wi-fi networks (or you’re done with a previously saved connection). If doesn’t work retry. This works everytime with my phone which has android 2.2.1. Thanks! </p>
<p> im using samsung galaxy s2.. wifi button on slider becomes dark green and the setting tab shows error everytime i connect to wifi. tried the codes but it shows driver loading unsuccessful.. please help me ! </p>

<p> Hi I’m having the same problem with my wi-fi connection, it keeps reconnecting all the time, I’ve been trying all solutions posted in this article but it didn’t work. </p>
<p> The ONLY SOLUTION that worked for me is to power off and power on my router, it always helps… </p>
<p> It’s definitely the ANDROID fault, I’m just wondering when the f***ing google dev team will get rid of this problem!!!! </p>
<p> I have a Samsung Galaxy SL I9003 with 2.3.6 DDKP3 firmware….my wi-fi gets disconnected frequently after getting connected….I have tried using*#*#526#*#* and the fix my wifi app and i have also cleared teh cache as suggested by you but unfortunately the problem still persists. Please suggest me a permanent solution. I am in deep trouble. Please reply and help. </p>
<p> Me too dude, me too. I just got a Samsung Exhibit II 4G. I am a very techy dude. I set up my home wifi myself, after fighting with Cisco on the ‘net and the phone. It was a firmware update for the Linksys router. I’ve got my laptop on my system w/o any problems. I connected my desktop w/o any probs. Samsung phone- problem. I’ve received a letter from Comcast that my router needs to be updated to DOCSIS 3 for better speeds. I’ll see what a new router costs. I’m trying to pinpoint why my Samsung Exhibit authenticates, then drops my wifi connection in 3 seconds. It’s going to be something stupid and might take me a while to search for it. All that Android app-crap for wifi isn’t going to solve the problem, it’s in the router settings or the firmware on the phone needs an update. I don’t think Samsung will be too helpful on this matter. </p>
<p> I purchased Galaxy Fit 2 days before. wifi is working fine at my home. </p>
<p> where as at my workplace its showing Connecting.. disconnected.. then not ina range </p>

<p> Hi, I’m experiencing a problem with my galaxy note. I noted that though the wifi is connected to my home router, the phone continuously attempts to connect each 2 or 3 seconds, finding other connections, then hiding them again, then scanning again, and finding other connections, etc. All the time it stays connected on my router, but it consumes A LOT of battery! I tried everything, I also tried an hard reset, but the problem remains. I have updated my phone to gingerbread.XXLA4, my kernel version is 2.6.35.7-N7000XXLA4-CL886827. Please help me! I will be eternally grateful. </p>

<p> I have a MID wm 8650 and the wifi stopped working, before I rooted it and have rooted it a few times but have not worked so I think that it is the hareware, I downloaded a wifi buddy and it said that the wifi is disabled, so i enabled it and it went off again, so I’m wondering what could be the problem with it. </p>
<p> Need to update u more, wifi notification icon, even i turn off the wifi, it will auto turn ON itself , scanning without any detection all time. also MAC address found missing… </p>
<p> Recently my S2 wifi connection got problem, when i turn it on, it canot detect any wifi available in the surrounding, even at home my router is open free access all time, tested with my S1- no problem . I have google thru , found tons of problems with S2 wifi.. i don’t see any cure yet. </p>
<p> do a full clear cache n wipe factory, the same happen, it just kept scanning non-stop, unable to stop although the wifi has been off, sometime the wifi icon would turn lighter green n the phone gets heated up badly. </p>
<p> tried with other stock rom version , the same happen, tried with the key *#*#526#*#* – driver is fine, Could this be hardware issue with the wifi – if so any technical hardware so i can open up S2 n check ? my hands are getting itchy n can’t wait to operate S2 -overly frustrated. </p>
<p> Please advice.. thank you </p>

<p> I am facing a strange problem with my Android ACE phone. I am able to connect to Wi-Fi and able to browse Google. But unable to connect to my Internal Servers / network. What is the problem? Will it be an issue with the device or is it the problem with router? Same Server is accessible through my IPAD2!! </p>
<p> same problem. wifi button on slider becomes dark green and the setting tab crashes. Samsung galaxy s2. i restored manufacture settings hoping that it was a software issue but problem persists. using 2.3.3 and don’t understand how you can upgrade or use kies air without wifi enabled. </p>
<p> if this settings can help you, try this… go to the MARKET and find wefi PRO Beta…. </p>
<p> I have a sonyericsson xperia mini pro.. My mobile cant find my wifi modem.. I tried to connect to another WiFi modem but i cant either! in wireless setting under the name of my wifi network has written not in range, secured with WPA/WPA2 PSK. I changed SSID and password of modem and add wifi network many times but my mobile couldn’t connect to modem! I either reinsert battery and use Fix My WiFi but still this problem exists! Please help me.. thanks a lot… </p>
<p> i change my modem security to : open, (wthout password) and make a network with my modem SSID in wireless setting on mobile, and still it didnt work (wrote: Not in Range). After some minutes I set password in modem (head over heels) and sudden i saw my phone that wrote WiFi found! i can connect to network now… Try it, hope to help you all :)) </p>
<p> try keeping the Wi FI AS OPEN! may be it has some issues in detecting the wep key! </p>
<p> still its disconnecting..i am not able to download anything from market. Can u please suggest any release which is stable.. </p>
<p> Dude- quit acting like you know what you are talking about. Every time you answer something you say “check this” or “check that”- that isn’t a fucking answer! If you don’t know how to help, don’t help! telling me to check my firmware (what the fuck is firmware?!) doesn’t help me with shit. Either answer the questions, or fuck off. </p>
<p> OK, I have been using the phone for a couple of months now and things have settled down. It DOES seem to connect to MOST public WiFi hotspots OK. I think my bad luck was that the FIRST place I tried it (A place where I regularly go) won’t work and some soon after did not work as well – JUST MY BAD LUCK! I am prepared to accept that some WiFi access points (e.g. some public hotspots) just won’t play well with all devices and I think that is just a fact of WiFi life! I am now getting to like my Samsung Ace as an entry level introduction to Android type phone 🙂 Maybe other Android phones connect to more hotspots more reliably? It’s impossible to say without a head-to-head comparison imo… </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S 2 some times connection issues are there after restart its OK but how do i know that mobile is not in range to restart. </p>
<p> Hi. How can i solve the problem with my Galaxy Y? It cannot connect on Wi-Fi. My computer can connect, but my Samsung can’t. Do I need to configure something then. And how. Thank you. </p>
<p> My samsung Galaxy s2 after 3 months of wifi working perfectly,has suddenly stopped activating. It freezes up the setting screen doesn’t allow the phone to turn off unless i keep pressing the on-off button. I tried the Wlan test engineering mode thing *#*#526.. but it just won’t do anything. 3g connection works fine. Any suggestions please. </p>
<p> i just purchsed a samsung galaxy Y (S5360). i m trying to connect it with my broadband wifi for last two days, with all possibilites and measures possible i.e. with static and movable ip settings. in static ip it showing connected with good signal strength but though i m not able to browse and surf. pls help and guide me ……………i am worried. your enriched knowledge and guidence will be highly appricated………………thanks </p>
<p> one thing ……i can browse and everything else through my airtel mobile net connection. ………………… </p>
<p> One thing, you are trying to connect with your broadband or Wifi? Check if any other phones Wi-Fi is working fine with that settings? Apply the same for your Galaxy Y phone. </p>
<p> I have the same issue with my galaxy s2 (2.3.5) as above as someone stated : It starts trying to connect and then connect, disabled, obtaining IP address and going in circles like that.. Before upgrading from 2.3.3 to 2.3.5 also, i had the very same problem. </p>
<p> But my brother is having the same handset – S2 (2.3.3) which connects without any issues. </p>
<p> check with the Wi Fi settings. is it dynamic or the Static ip connection? Check with the DNS Settings and host settings! </p>
<p> i have a samsung s2 with andriod 2.3.3 just a couple of weeks ago, i can browse, download from the market thru the wifi, but after a while i cant connect to any net site, even thought my wifi signal is excellent, i already test the above procedures, but still i cant connect, pls help.,,,, </p>
<p> Does your Wi-Fi signal from the router is able to connect with other devices than the one which you have ? Did you try that? If you are able to connect then there is problem with your S2 phone or you need to configure settings. </p>
<p> Main problem is Mac authentication. You need to disable Mac authentication in your router & it will connect immediately. </p>
<p> This would work in theory but what I did was add an exception using the mac address of what I wanted to connect to the network. Your mac is still enabled and you can connect. I can now use wi-fi whenever I want. </p>
<p> I have Galaxy Ace & I am also facing same issue of frequent WiFi connect-disconnect. This seems to be some update they made automatically in the os as it was working till not & now it seems lots of people are facing this problem in last 15-20 days. I hopes they fix this soon. </p>
<p> I have on Galaxy Ace Mini for 1 month which has been working fine until one day and now i cannot access internet at all. It starts trying to connect and then connect, disabled, obtaining IP address and going in circles like that.. I already tried to dial *#*#526#*#*, it says, “Driver loading successful”. My android version is 2.2.1. </p>
<p> I have just recently upgraded my phone via “3” in the UK from a Nokia E71 (Which I have had for three years) to a Samsung Galaxy Ace GTS-5830 (Had two weeks!). The Nokia E71 connects to WiFi public and private hotspots flawlessly, the Samsung Ace DOES NOT. Don’t get me wrong, the Samsung Ace connects to some hot spots fine HOWEVER for many public security protected hotspots it just will not connect at all, it gives the problem others have described here: </p>
<p> * You see the SSID (Signal strength ‘strong’ or ‘fair’) * It tries to connect (I actually GOT a connection ONCE for about three seconds!) * It drops the connection – usually immediately * Most of the time it simply does not make a connection at all but simply ‘cycles’ between ‘scanning…’ and ‘Disconnected’…… * The SSID then shows as ‘out of range’ which is a lie as my Nokia continues to work flawlessly with a STRONG signal recorded. </p>
<p> Of course it is impossible to change any of the settings of the public WiFi hotspots (Wireless Access Points), I have a Nokia phone and a Acer laptop both connect to the hotspots flawlessly the Samsung Galaxy Ace will not connect…. </p>
<p> What would you suggest I do? </p>
<p> Many thanks in advance for any assistance or pointers you can give me, </p>

<p> (I want to love Android but frankly my very initial experiences have NOT been impressive as this is a fundamental feature of a smart phone that should just work ‘out-of-the-box’. It currently reflects poorly on Samsung and the Galaxy, Ace, and Android Brands – Older products work much better) </p>
<p> ps I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to go into a WiFi enabled cafe, sit down order a coffee and try out my new phone only to find it does not work (First time out!) whilst my old phone continues to work just fine! </p>
<p> I have. The galaxy fit and have the same issue that I connect to my wifi network for a couple od minutes and then it disconnects and then I cannot con net again. I always have to power off my modem and then on again and and then it connects for a while and again it disconnects. I know it’s the wep settings but don’t know how to fix it. Please help </p>
<p> What is the firmware that you are on now? Is this problem happened before you upgraded the firmware? </p>
<p> I was ofered an galaxy gio, with the 2.2.1 version of android everything went well when i updated the official version of samsung 2.2.3, my wireless its always failing and crashing android, to resolve the problem had to go back to the 2.2.1 version from march that i found, and now all its good. </p>
<p> The questions: </p>
<p> Android version problems? not beeing reported has so? Or a problem with the hardware that only manifests, on the newer versions? </p>
<p> I had my Galaxy Fit for over 2 months which has been working fine until I recently upgraded the latest Firmware, and then the problem started. Connected, disabled, obtaining IP address from xxxx. Cannot access to internet at all. When type in *#*#526#*#*, it says, “Driver loading successful”. Any advice is very much appreciated. </p>
<p> The problem maybe with the firmware update. Revert back to the firmware that you had previously and check out whether it works or not ! </p>
<p> My samsung galaxy gio mobile ap is not working.it gets connected alright but cannot open the internet.pls am online.reply asap.thnx </p>

<p> Plz plz plz help me!! i would greatly appreciate it 🙂 </p>
<p> And just tried Fix My Wifi, which for me is now called Perhaps Fix Someone Else’s Wifi But Not Mine 🙁 </p>
<p> BTW There is a 3 day demo version of Fix My Wifi if anyone else wants to give it a go </p>
<p> I’ve got exactly the same problem as Aarti. I have Galaxy Ace Android v2.3.3. I have tried wifi fixer, wifi advanced configuration editor, #*#526#*#*, making router ssid unhidden (broadcast) – this last one seemed to help for a few hours then not. </p>
<p> Have not yet updated as people reporting similar issues with gingerbread. Is there any other solution to this problem? Someone mentioned trying a static ip… What do you think? </p>
<p> hi . i have a galaxy ace Samsung mobile just bought two days back. i connected to wifi when i switch on the mobile for the first time.. but after some time the connection got lost. now its not connecting to wifi. the signal strength is very strong also .. still not connecting </p>

<p> How to Fix Black Screen Bug in HTC One Android Phone – Guide </p>
<p> Black screen bug seems to be haunting back HTC users again and this time it’s with HTC One M8 Android phone. So next time when you see your phone not booting up or for say if your phone shows the black screen, you need not have to run to the service centre straight away as in the due course of this article we will be telling you an instant way out which will make sure that you fix this issue in DIY manner. While there are tons of methods which claim to fix the black screen bug error with the complicated apps and third party apps, but tend to forget the simplest possible method. So let’s check out on what are the possible options so as to fix the Black screen bug. </p>
<p> Option 1: First thing you need to do is to just charge the device with at last 30 minutes so as to make sure that your phone is not showing the black screen because of ultra-low battery. </p>
<p> Option 2: Press Volume Down button and Power till you see the HBoot menu as shown below so as to access the Fastboot/ Recovery menu. Head over to the “Factory Reset” option to factory reset the device for following the on screen instructions for clearing the cache and data. Unfortunately, this step will clear all the data present in your phone as you have no option to create the backup of data present in your phone. But this step usually fixes all the minor issues in your device. </p>
<p> After clearing the cache and wiping the data, you need to select the option of “Reboot system now” for rebooting the device. It might take longer time than expected for booting the device as it has to ready all the apps from the start. </p>
<p> Option 3: Just in case if your device doesn’t boot, you need to run the RUU (ROM Update Utility). You can probably update the firmware again. Just in case if you want to downgrade the firmware, you need to S-Off (Security Off) first. </p>
<p> Last but not the least, just in case if still your phone refuses to boot up or shows the black screen, you have no option but to take your phone to the service centre for fixing this issue. Do let us know in the comments section just in case if you face any issues in the process. </p>

<p> Fix Can’t Establish a Reliable Data Connection to the Server Error on Android </p>
<p> Though Android is the best platform for mobile and other computing device, you might get in some trouble for which you might blame others though the problem is something else. Like for example, if you continue to have problem with your Google Account on your Android phone then it’s not good to blame Android OS and maybe the problem can be something else. </p>
<p> Can’t Establish a Reliable Data Connection to the Server Error </p>
<p> The Google Nexus One & Droid X phone users have continuously experienced the problem of can’t establish the reliable data connection to the server errors creep in. This problem also can creep in although you have configured it on your phone. </p>
<p> This is the error that I am talking about – </p>
<p> The Reason </p>
<p> This happens because you might have forgotten to set up your Google Account when you first boot your phone with the new firmware. The only solution to this problem is that you should hard reset your mobile phone. Here is the procedure which explains it how to do it – </p>
<p> The hard reset on your phone will do the trick for you. Remember that doing this will erase all the data on your phone memory and other APN settings present on your phone. You should again contact your service provider to get the APN settings or its better to note it down somewhere else and then apply them manually. Note that the data which is present on the microSD card will not be lost. </p>
<p> To hard reset your phone you have to go to Settings > Security and then select Factory Data Reset. We have gone through the complete procedure of any mobile phone on ‘hard reset your Android phone’. </p>
<p> Once you have followed that step and rebooted your phone, don’t forget to provide your Google account login information this time. If you have forgotten to provide those details then you would again need to reset your phone. Check out the problem goes or not? </p>
<p> Here is the video where we have performed a hard reset on Galaxy S II phone – </p>
<p> httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBALKYqXWxs </p>
<p> Alternative Fix </p>
<p> If that above fix is not working for you then you can try out ‘YouTube Connection Trick’ to rectify this problem. Follow the below steps – </p>
<p> Add YouTube app and login into your Gmail account. </p>
<p> Go through the Gmail asp and add account if needed. </p>
<p> Sign in to your Gmail account with your user name and the password. </p>
<p> Go through your login process and now try to check Menu > Settings > Account & Sync and then select “Add account” and add a secondary account. </p>
<p> This solution will work out if the above doesn’t works. </p>
<p> Let us know if that doesn’t fixes and the issue still continues while you try connecting Gmail. </p>

<p> Guys, after 2 hours of searching, and missing a night with my soon to be wife, I found a solution, for me I install Google Play on a Coby Kyros 1125, which did not come with the Market app.. so I had to install all the services that it needed. Most of you probably already have done that and kept on hitting that damn “Can’t establish a reliable data connection”. In my searching I ran across someone talking about the devices actual connection to the internet, for most of us it’s Wi-Fi… then the talk of it being a router issue… hmmmm being the IT guy that I am, that sounded like a reasonable issue, seeing as the router establishes an ip address upon connection… the fix I found out was… disconnect my tablet from the Wi-fi access point.. then re-establish a connection… viola!!! no more error! Hope this works, I know how much a pain in the rear this thing is 🙂 </p>
<p> I have the same problem and none of the workarounds do work for me. I am on ICS 4.0.4, but everything started a couple of days ago in GB 2.3.6. I have tried through openVPN, youtube, factory reset. Nothing is working. Sometimes the phone just get stuck signing in until it runs out of battery. I have tried changing into one step verification and changed passwords. The youtube workaround shouldn’t work anymore in 4.0.4 as it seems google has integrated all the signing in process into Accounts & sync as google, not youtube. Any ideas? because here I am dry and want to through my Note against a wall. </p>
<p> i cant access my android market . i have a sony ericsson xperia x 10 mini and it keeps saying the same thing over and over again can someone pple help me plz plzzz </p>

<p> I am using Motorola Atrix 2 mobile. I continue to receive the same \ Can’t establish a data connection\ Error. I don’t know how to rectify this problem. </p>
<p> I even Give it a flash with The fastboot files available on the Net but even that won’t solve my problem at all. </p>
<p> I had this problem when I tried to add second Google Account. I tried logging in the YouTube app with the second account and it worked. Problem solved THX guys. </p>
<p> NOTHING is working!!! I can add all my gmail accounts except my primary account AKA the one that has all my apps attached. I’d hate to have a phone in paperweight mode and I am not eligible for an upgrade for a few months. “Can’t establish a reliable data connection to the server” shows up after the hard reset, and you have entered the incorrect password shows up if i add another account before my primary. </p>

<p> Fix Galaxy S III Battery Bug & Get Actual Discharge Reports </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone seems to have caught in one more buggy controversy and this time its related to the battery bug. Generally, its ideally meant that when the device is in the idle mode or say in the Stand by mode, its assumed that the battery charge consumed will be very less or should be minimum. But as per some users and some forums, there is a serious flaw as the below image clearly shows that despite Galaxy S III being on stand by, the device is consuming more battery. As of now unfortunately, there is no Official fix from Samsung but we have got a temporary stand by fix for the same which will lower the battery charge by Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone. The power drain value in power_profile.xml is changed to 3.4 mA(approx value) from 34mA (which is highly impossible). </p>
<p> Procedure to Fix Galaxy S III Battery Bug & Get Actual Discharge Reports: </p>
<p> First up, open the open the framework-res.apk file with the help of Win RAR or with the help of 7Zip tool and navigate to the “framework-res\res\xml” file and then select the existing “power_profile.xml” file and add the one which is attached over here. </p>
<p> Up next you will have to copy the framework-res.apk file back into your device and then restart the device. </p>
<p> If you are unable to fix the battery issue with the help of above steps, you can Download the CWM Battery Fix for Galaxy S III from here to your computer and then connect your device to the computer to place the same in your device. </p>
<p> Disconnect the device and turn Off the device so that it can be entered in the recovery mode. The recovery mode can be entered by Pressing the Volume Up Key + Menu Key and then press the Power button to enter the device in the recovery mode. </p>
<p> In recovery mode, select “install zip from SD Card” and select the zip file which you have placed in the phone. It will take around 5 – 6 minutes for applying the same. </p>
<p> So there you go, you have now successfully applied the fix in your device. Do share with us in the comments section if you still face the battery issues as we will try our level best to sort out the same. </p>

<p> the file will not install autentfiication is missing i thing its only for rooted phones </p>
<p> Sorry guys, i’m not able to access the apk file from my computer to change the power-profile.xml and reinstall the apk on the phone. Neither winrar nor 7zip are able to access the phone, and windows explorer won’t let access but the sd-card. </p>
<p> I tried to change the file on the phone but that isn’t possible as i can’t reconvert the extracted framework-res.apk with the changed xml to an apk. </p>
<p> I don’t have an external sd, so factory mode won’t work. </p>
<p> I cant find the option “install zip from SD Card” what if i have not inserted any SD card? if i have put the zip in mass memory?? </p>

<p> Fix Galaxy S4 Heating Issues & Check Temperature during Gaming Playback & Browsing </p>
<p> There have been numerous reports on the web claiming that the Samsung Galaxy S4 heats up a lot and we did a quick video on the same while making a note of the temperature. We played a few resource intensive games and browsed the web for a few minutes continuously to ensure that the device heats up. Following this we checked the results of the battery usage along with the temperature as shown below and found that as the temperature increased, the battery also went down at the same time. </p>
<p> Now during this test we found that the device actually heats up around the Camera area and does not go to the extent we found on the Snapdragon S4 devices earlier. Check out the Video below which can help you in fixing the heating issues on the Galaxy S4. </p>
<p> As shown below there are the Notification Shortcuts which displays few options which can not only heat up your device but also use a lot of your battery which include the ones which need the sensors to be running all the time. In short you should disable the Air Gesture, Sync, Smart Stay, Smart Scroll, Air View etc if you are not using them all the time to ensure that the device stays cool. </p>
<p> To sum up, we would suggest you to watch the video above for more insights on this topic. Do let us know if you still get the heating issues on your smart phone even after trying out the steps mentioned in the above video. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Fix GPS on Samsung Galaxy SL i9003 for Accurate Location </p>
<p> Just like the Samsung Galaxy S GT I9000 had problems with the GPS initially, though it solved the issue at a later stage with the Android 2.2 Froyo update, now Samsung Galaxy SL I9003 which is the same phone which looks like Galaxy S I9000, the difference being the on lesser board memory, camera is Powered by flash in I9003 and the screen as Galaxy SL I9003 comes along with the Super Clear LCD screen and not to forget all this costs lesser than the AMOLED laden Galaxy S GT I9000 by a whopping around not less than 5-6k INR. </p>
<p> So, repeating with what Samsung Galaxy S GT I9000 devices which launched with Eclair 2.1 version had occurred, Galaxy SL owners too are facing the GPS issue. So, let’s check out on how you can rectify that with a simple patch which will take care that the GPS in your Galaxy SL I9003 is fixed. The GPS problem can be fixed very easily, you need not even require to update your device with any sorts of firmware or go through any lengthy processes. All you need to do is to just follow the simple procedure and you are done with the fixing of GPS issue which actually shows the wrong location. Just after applying the software patch as mentioned below, the location in your phone will be correctly shown so that all your location based services like facebook, foursquare, Google Maps etc. work very well without any issues. </p>
<p> Many of the users had an issue that the GPS only worked for 15-20 seconds after turning it ON and then it turned off automatically. Keeping in mind that it’s very frustrating at times, let’s see on how to fix the same. Basically there are two tweaks with which you can improve or correct the GPS bug with which you are being shown wrong locations. Though it’s recommended to follow both the tweaks to get the best ever performance of GPS even in indoors but if you wish to just improve the location and make it as normal then just follow the procedure 1 to fix it. The below mentioned tweaks can be applied to all the Samsung Galaxy SL I9003 phones which are present Worldwide. Please note that we should not be held responsible if you apply the below patch to any other phone model, so ensure that you follow each and every below mentioned step carefully. </p>
<p> Procedure 1 to fix GPS (Patch): </p>
<p> First up you will have to ensure that your phone’s model name is Samsung Galaxy SL I9003 and not any other phone so as to facilitate proper bug fixing of the GPS. </p>
<p> After identifying them ensure that the GPS is turned Off and not switched ON in any manner and also close all location based services preferably. </p>
<p> With the help of dialer, dial this alpha numeric code “*#*#3214789650#*#*” which basically opens up the Lib Test Mode or directly too you can open the same. </p>
<p> Now, after this below the “Applications Settings”, you will have to change the “Timeout(s)” to 100 and then after this under the “SUPL / CP Settings” you will have to change the Server and Port to supl.google.com and the port number needs to be entered as 7276. </p>
<p> Now, all you need to do is to just reboot the phone as to apply the changes effectively in your phone. As you can see that in the screen shot which is shown above the GPS Satellite status has been shown and out of 8 satellites its showing that 5 are being detected successfully. </p>
<p> Procedure 2 to fix GPS (Tweak): </p>
<p> Just in case after following the above step, you are not getting accuracy of 100% then all you need to do is to just follow the below trick. This fix is being implemented so as to facilitate the better Antenna capability with the help of a simple and home remedy which is possible with the help of Aluminium foil which is available freely in most of the homes. </p>
<p> With this tweak which is shown in the above screen shot you will not only constantly get 30-40SNR in gps test but will get with a constant 5meters of accuracy which is almost equivalent to the accurate location. This technique basically enhances the antenna power by increasing the antenna size as Aluminium is a metal and can catch signals efficiently. The aluminium foil needs to be folded in the small cylindrical roll as you can see in the below photo where the aluminium foil needs to be accommodated. </p>
<p> So, that’s it just by following the above two simple tips you have successfully improved the GPS location of your Samsung Galaxy SL I9003. Do let us know if you still face any issues while accesing the GPS even after performing the above two tweaks as mentioned in the above tutorial. </p>

<p> That little tweak with the tin foil fixed all of my problems (which only began with the latest software update for Android!) </p>
<p> Please help:Because my firmware on i9003 is 2.3.5-so it happens nothing if i try to put in *#*#….. </p>
<p> i m very new to this android .. just wanted to check one thing do we need to have connectivity for GPS, i mean if the phone is not connected to network still v can have the GPS…? I have recently purchased this galaxy sl, and once i go to navigate, it says “waiting for location” but nothing happens … </p>
<p> Hi… I have Samsung Galaxy S I9003 and I tried to add some maps but i failed ..are there any suggestions. plz?? </p>
<p> Mine is Samsung Galaxy GT i9003 and when I followed the Tweak#1 and then changed the operation mode to “MS Based” under Applications, my GPS started working and its locating accurately. </p>
<p> My GPS does not work at all, it will not show any location in google map… I already tried both methods and it is still the same…is there any solution for this problem? </p>
<p> I have a GT-S5660 Galaxy GIO. Anyone know if there’s a fix like this, or if this one will work? </p>
<p> but, it won’t break it will it? If I find the menus are as described, it might work? </p>
<p> i tried both.. my phone gps working good in outdoor.. but its not working in indoor.. it shows some where else as my location.. so give me some good ideas to solve this indoor issue.. </p>
<p> the first fix did not worked in my samsung GT I9003… steel in room or in car or in bus gps is not connected at all even after 2-3 minuts. </p>
<p> The ‘patch’ shown above is taken from another site and it was double sided tape – not metal – it has nothing to do with metal – the idea was simply to increase the pressure on the aerial contacts – the backing on one side was left on so the tape doesn’t stick to the back cover </p>
<p> hey mike is your issue solved ? but have you tried at least following the second method? </p>
<p> hey i tries everythng d i m using GPS aids too bt mah mobile is only detecting 1 sattalite and not even connecting to it………………. its a big prob </p>
<p> In my case, all I needed was to change in the operation mode to ‘MS based’ under applications. Now it works perfectly ! In fact, all other settings were correct on the phone. </p>
<p> Can anyone please help, nothing happens when i dial the alphanumeric code. Is there something i am not doing right or is it cause i am using the os 2.3.3 on my i9003 </p>
<p> i m very new to this android .. just wanted to check one thing do we need to have connectivity for GPS, i mean if the phone is not connected to network still v can have the GPS…? I have recently purchased this galaxy sl, and once i go to navigate, it says “waiting for location” but nothing happens … </p>
<p> Hi, I’m stil having problem with it. Do u mind to give me all the configuration about gps setting? Like for ‘gps logging’ should I turn it on? </p>
<p> yea, i follow it, but as ur info, my GPS logging setting in my phone is set as “off”, in ur instruction, there isn’t any guide state that should it be on or off. </p>
<p> In addition to fix 1, download GPSAid2(Frre) from android market. Use it to detect GPS position and when you have locked iit activate your GPS navigation. </p>
<p> Neither option worked for me, phone still takes up to 10 minutes to lock and sometimes doesn’t lock at all. Has anyone tried any other methods? </p>
<p> Fix 1 didn’t work for me. No location: latitude, longitude. No locking to satellites. </p>
<p> So, in addition with Fix 1, I’ve changed the ‘Standalone’ mode to ‘MS Based’ and disabled the WIFI data connection. Then I’ve used my mobile operator network packet data connection. With these settings in place, under a clear sky I was able to lock 6 satellites but still latitude, longitude timed out. In this trial and error process I have increased my time out to 300 second. But none of these are actually helping. </p>
<p> I’m in Vietnam, my fone is samsung gt-i9003, I had tried both methods but just receive 3 satellites (although stand outside home) and “GPS Status & ToolBox” does not give result ! Some advices pls ! </p>
<p> It is advised here “to ensure that your phone’s model name is Samsung Galaxy SL I9003 and not any other phone”., but what shall I do with my Galaxy S GT I 9003. My GPS gives an error up to 2 Km some times. Please advise </p>

<p> Fix Insufficient Space Error on Android Market with Cache Fixer App & Wipe Temp Data </p>
<p> The Android Play Store has a huge collection of applications for your Android smartphone which might be highly graphic rich games or small utility apps. For apps which are really large in size, the Android Play Store pops up an error message not allowing you to download them directly from the Play Store app. The error message reads as Insufficient Space Error and thus the download of the app gets aborted even before it can begin downloading. </p>
<p> For fixing this error, you can use this app from the Android Play Store named Cache Fixer. This is a free app and can be downloaded from the Play Store here . </p>
<p> This app requires that your Android phone is rooted and has Superuser access for the cache fixing to take place. If your phone is not rooted yet, make sure you root your phone first. Check this to know What is Android Rooting and its Advantages or Disadvantages . </p>
<p> As soon as you install the app and run it, a Superuser prompt will pop up which has to be approved. This is to ensure that the app is granted root access to your device and it is a must. </p>
<p> Now, a screen shows how much of size and what type should be used. While Tmpfs is a faster method to resize and fix your cache memory, it has lesser compatibility than the Data type which takes more time. Once you have chosen the type, which we recommend you choose Data, tap on Force EXT4 filesystem and click on Move Cache. </p>
<p> The process takes sometime to complete and this depends and varies from phone to phone and its processor, RAM etc. Once its done, the cache memory space will have been increased and it will display the new Size of the Cache memory and the free space parition on the top of the screen, right next to the icon of the app. </p>
<p> The Cache Fixer 1.1 also has options like Erase all data from the cache holder which cleanly wipes all the data from the Cache parition. Also, if you feel you have chosen the wrong filesystem or alloted the wrong amount of space, you can always go back to the defaults by choosing Restore Cache button from the options which restores it to the original state. </p>
<p> This app is a nice tool to reparition the cache memory as it can help you to use it as you want and the app can be downloaded free of cost from the Play Store here . </p>

<p> when i try downloading cache fixer from google play it still displays error 498. so how do i fix it? </p>
<p> It’s all fun and games before your phone won’t let you install Cache Fixer because “you don’t have enough space”. True Story. And I have more than enough space. So this is kind of a paradox. </p>
<p> Hi, I successfully installed the app on my Galaxy Q. But when i run the app by clicking on “Wipe CAche” I get an error message as “Error not Wiped”. Please help me resolve this issue. </p>

<p> How to Fix LED Notification Bug in Moto G Android Phone – Guide </p>
<p> Moto G is an all new Entry level Android smartphone released by Motorola just couple of days back and unfortunately there’s a small glitch when it comes to the Notification LED as in most of the cases it refuses to work the way it should have been. So, in this article we will be helping you out to fix the same. While there are enough number of applications which promises to notify you about all SMS’es, missed calls and other notifications, but when Motorola has itself come out with a specialized app then wy not use the same as it’s the Official App and not the third party app. </p>
<p> The main glitch is due to the restoring from Google Account to the Moto G Android phone which is a part of the Setup process. This restoring downloads the Apps and Settings from the Google Cloud wherein some cases it restores the LED Setting from another phone which in turn causes the issue of notification error. So, Motorola has come out with an independent app to fix the same and is called as Notification Light Widget in the Google PLAY Store. Notification Light Widget is a tool to enable/disable LED notification light on Android devices. Surprisingly, this app also works on most of the Android Phones with LED notification capability. </p>
<p> Download Notification Light Widget from here to your Moto G Android Phone. Once downloaded and installed in your device, install the same which will replace the required bugs in your device. </p>
<p> This is a Free to use application and this widget restores the ability to control the light on devices without an exposed setting. </p>
<p> On other android devices which already supports the control of the LED notification light, this widget can be used to enable / disable the LED notification light from the home screen. Do let us know in the comments section if the issue refuses to budge. </p>

<p> How to Fix SMS Exploit on Nexus 4, Nexus 5 & other Nexus Devices – Guide </p>
<p> Purchased an all new Nexus 5 Android smartphone? Recently, a new security exploit started affecting many Nexus smartphones with Flash SMS. This Vulnerability has been discovered by Bogdan Alecu, can force the device to remotely reboot, freeze, and face connectivity issues. For all those who wanted to know in detail, Flash SMS is a special class of message which by default is not stored and also doesn’t give any audio alert. These are nothing but the system alerts most of the times. In case of the Nexus exploit, the user of Nexus devices receive multiple messages without your dismissal and device behaves in erratic ways. As of now the non-Nexus smartphones appears to be safe. </p>
<p> No worries, there is a way out to get saved from this attack with Class0Firewall Android App. </p>
<p> What is Class0Firewall App? </p>
<p> Class0Firewall is basically a Proof of Concept (PoC) which protects user against an SMS attack which is discovered by Bogdan Alecu. </p>
<p> The message threshold is set for messages per minute which are allowed to be received in the device. If the number of messages exceeds the defined value, then the message gets dropped by Class 0 Firewall, hence saving the device from any attacks. </p>
<p> Download Class0Firewall from Google PLAY Store for blocking the Class 0 Messages. Though, the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 might just receive a fix for this attack, we are not sure if Samsung will push any OTA update for its Galaxy Nexus smartphone as it has stopped receiving any OTA update for a while now. </p>
<p> Based on the inputs and the testing, this vulnerability appears to only affect the Nexus line running on all versions of stock Android through to the current release of KitKat. </p>
<p> Do let us know in the comments section just in case if you have any queries or issues as we will try to fix them asap. </p>

<p> Fix WiFi Connectivity Error on ICS Android when SIM Inserted with WiFi Fix App </p>
<p> It looks like problem with Android and Wi Fi doesn’t get over with most of the Android consumers. Sometimes you might be able to connect your phone with Wi Fi but sometimes for many users the problem keeps repeating. Certainly most of the issues are related to the Wi Fi configuration but the problem can be different in different cases. One such explicit case was brought up by Fardjad wherein he noted that Wi Fi on his newly installed Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich OS doesn’t work. </p>
<p> As a developer, he thought that’s a kernel issue as these things are pretty common with custom firmware’s but eventually he learnt that it was the problem when SIM card is inserted in your mobile phone. Furthermore he was helped by developers at XDA Developers Forums and he realized that changing the Wi-Fi country code in the Secure System Settings will resolve the issue quickly. Finally a solution to his problem was brought live on Google Play Store as he designed an Android application which can automatically change the Wi-Fi Country code. </p>
<p> Sadly, this application works only for the rooted devices and it can be downloaded in the APK file format easily. The working of this application and installation is quite easy, you just need to open the apk file for installation after when you have downloaded, copied it to the root of your SD card. Once application is opened, you should do nothing as the application will automatically change the Wi-Fi country code when needed. You can invoke WiFix by manually dialing “*#94349#. </p>
<p> Users who want to disable this application they can simply uninstall this application using the known Android app uninstall process. </p>

<p> recently installed new motherboard… phone back at gingerbread 2.3.6,,, wifi says error when trying to connect and no usb notification when i connect to my pc, not getting to access mass storage… hence my phone dsnt show up on odin,,,, idk what to do </p>
<p> Does this problem exist in Jelly Bean as well? Why not simply upgrade OEM Jelly Bean available in most devices. Will it Solve the problem. I am facing the same issue in HTC with ICS 4.0.4. </p>
<p> THE SAME HAS BEEN FIXED FROM JELLYBEAN ONWARDS AS IT COMES WITH BLUETOOTH LE SUPPORT </p>
<p> I recently updated my SGH-i727 Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket from the Gingerbread 2.3.6 to the Ice cream Sandwich 4.0.4. The WiFi did connect to home uverse router. But, not as snappy as the previous Radio. Also, I noticed that with the 2.3.6 I could be half a block away walking the dog and still connected to my wifi with a bar or two. With ICS4.0.4 I am barely on the front porch and get one or two bars. Possibly they will update with a better radio, or I can root and try CM9. I was waiting CM10 (JB4.1.1). The decreased range doesn’t necessarily force me to use more 4g data. It does irritate me to no end though. </p>

<p> Flappy48 Game for Android Combines Flappy Bird & 2048 – Features, Download Now </p>
<p> There’s a new game in the town. And we aren’t talking about the fully loaded high-end game here, but a very simple and interesting game for those who indulge themselves into things that don’t give a torture test to their device. It is called the Flappy48, and the game brings the idea of Flappy Bird and the 2048 game together. </p>
<p> It’s a very simple game, and we are pretty sure this too might touch the sky in praises, although no one would leave a chance from calling the developer a copycat for using the concepts of two separate games in one, but the final outcome is good enough so who cares? You just need to keep adding the numbers and you can skip any of them coming in the way, or can even try to break the chain from the back if any unnecessary number comes in the end. </p>
<p> There are no twists or turns in the game, and it goes in the most simplest way, so you don’t really have to hit your brain hard, just like what was with the Flappy Bird. A little intelligence is needed on selection of the numbers that come on the way, as a long chain would make it a mess and end the game. Try to keep adding the small numbers in the front, and keep none of them on the back. </p>
<p> There are many users facing a few issues such as the lagging of the game, and one of the problems we saw is that – you cannot exit the game from within the app, and you can only press the home button to go out of the game. Few users even reported the crashing of the app in the first few seconds itself, so we expect an update for this coming out soon. For now, you could enjoy playing the Flappy48 in your Android device by going to the following Play Store link. </p>

<p> Flipkart Big Billion Days – Best Android Deals to Track & Save Money </p>
<p> All the online and offline channels across the sub-continent reports the majority of their sales during the festive season around Diwali. Last year, Flipkart launched a campaign by name Big Billion Day Sale where it sold many products at a decent price compared to the offline market. The similar kind of sale was seen on Snapdeal and Amazon the same day. According to Flipkart, the sale is ideal for customers looking for gift their friends and family this festive season. Now, Flipkart is all set to host its second Big Billion Days Sale scheduled from October 13 to October 17, and the company has promised a better user experience this year. </p>
<p> Flipkart’s last year Big Billion Day Sale was not so successful as it could not meet the customer expectations. The customers were hugely disappointed as they faced many technical glitches in the website, automatic cancellation of orders, out of stock issues because of the low prices of the products and many more. However, Flipkart was quite happy as it managed Rs 600 crore worth of sales, despite customers complaining the company to issue an apology email. </p>
<p> In order to empower and prepare sellers better during the peak festive demand season and to avoid a re-run of last year’s technical and logistical glitches, Flipkart has worked up a unique training schedule and manpower ecosystem programme. Launched about two months ago, the e-commerce major has already reached out to over 6,000 sellers across the country through the two initiatives – ‘Flipkart Seller Campus’ and ‘Flipkart Helping Hands.’ </p>
<p> Flipkart CEO and co-founder Sachin Bansal, said, last year’s Big Billion Day Sale, which had participation from 1.5 million shoppers, was a huge learning experience. This year the company is ramping up logistics to ensure the user experience is smooth and hassle-free. Considering the festive season, the company will have 19,000 delivery boys and will cover more than 20,000 pin codes across the nation. </p>
<p> The company also declared that this year’s Big Billion Days Sale will be app-only to handle the traffic during the big sales and festive season. “On an average, we get about 75% of our traffic through mobile-only devices. We expect it to peak during the discount sale to over 80%,” said Ankit Nagori, Chief Business Officer Flipkart. He further added, “the company has reportedly added its own data centres across major metros to manage online traffic during this app-only sale.” </p>
<p> Flipkart is keen on moving ahead with its app-based strategy and has also promised that a lot more products will be available for sale this year, unlike last year’s sale that offered limited products at an extremely discounted prices. The Big Billion Days sale will be applicable across almost all product categories on Flipkart but among them the most popular product categories would be electronics, computers and accessories, and smartphones. </p>
<p> The company’s recent purchase, Myntra, will also be part of the Big Billion Days sale this year. Flipkart has also tied up with banks like State Bank of India, Standard Chartered, and Citibank to offer cash back and additional discounts for the customers. </p>
<p> Tips for the Big Billion Days Sale: </p>
<p> As we said earlier, this year Flipkart’s sale will be app-only, ensure your app is updated for smooth user experience. Make sure you have a reliable connection while making a purchase as the biggest deals usually goes live on Flipkart Big Billion Days Sale. </p>
<p> Keep a list of the products ready that you wish to buy as going through a sale on an app could be painful too. Make sure you don’t miss out a deal on the products you need the most. Search for them on the app before you start browsing all items on sale. Keep a wish list ready on the app to help you out. </p>
<p> Keep your contact information like delivery addresses and payment information saved for faster checkouts. You don’t need to worry as the saving of payment information is always secure on e-commerce sites like Flipkart. </p>
<p> Before purchasing a product quickly compare the prices of other major online retailers like Amazon, Snapdeal and Paytm as these online stores are also hosting promotional sales more or less at the same time as Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. </p>
<p> Use credit or debit cards issued by State Bank of India, Citibank and Standard Chartered as Flipkart has tied up with these banks to offer cash back and additional discounts for the customers. </p>
<p> (deals will be updated shortly) </p>

<p> Buy Moto X in India: Available from Rs. 23999 on Flipkart – Details, Color Options </p>
<p> Moto X, the smartphone which took Motorola into a good level from almost no where in the market, is finally getting into the Indian market, and just like it’s low-cost sibling Moto G, the device would be sold via Flipkart exclusively. The online retailer had teased about the device coming soon into the market, and since then, there has been quite some hype about the launch date and availability but finally, the Flipkart Twitter page shows that this device will be available from 19th March. And finally, this device is available on Flipkart. </p>
<p> Head over to the following link to purchase the Moto X from Flipkart, based on the storage option. </p>
<p> Moto X Price in India – Wooden and customized back – Rs. 25999 </p>
<p> The offer included is: </p>
<p> Get 70% off on Moto X covers post delivery of the phone. </p>
<p> 10 Lucky customers get 100% cashback (as store credit) on answering a simple question. </p>
<p> Buy Moto X on 6-month EMI and get Flat Rs 1000/- cashback. </p>
<p> For this price, the device isn’t really expensive for the OS, the build and also the excellent features provided in it. </p>
<p> The White and black options would be available right away, i.e. from March 19th, while the customized options would be available for pre-order and the actual shipping would be from April 2nd, 2014. The wooden back will be having the Teak and Walnut finish. Moto X is available with the EMI option as well and you get Rs. 1000 cashback if you choose that option, and for now, Flipkart is even offering the cases for the Moto X for some cheaper price, i.e. 70% off the original price. </p>
<p> Earlier: Earlier the Indian e-retailer Flipkart has partnered with Motorola to bring the Moto G into the Country now, and all of a sudden, it has planned to bring the Moto X and also posted a teaser of the Smartphone on its social media channels. Similar to what the company has done with the Moto G, the company has stated that it will be introducing launch day offers for the Moto X buyers. Moreover Flipkart has also revealed that two wooden back customization for the device will also be available. </p>
<p> We cannot assure you that Moto Maker will be available but two of these wooden backs are available alongside the plastic variant. This will definitely be exciting news for all the Moto X lovers as it is to me! The company also said that the Moto X in India will be coming in five different color options alongside the two wood back, namely the teak and walnut. </p>
<p> Just in case if you have forgot, let me remind you that Moto X is a 4.7 inch 720p HD display that released last year in the month of August. The device will be powered by a 1.7 GHz dual core Qualcomm MSM8960Pro Snapdragon processor coupled with 2GB of RAM. It also has a 10 megapixel rear camera with LED flash and a 2 megapixel front-facing camera. The onboard memory of the device is at 16 Gb and will be coming out of the box with Android 4.2 Jelly Bean OS but the KitKat update is available. </p>
<p> Earlier the Moto X was launches in US for $579 and later was reduced for $399, so we can expect a similar kind for pricing in India for around Rs. 25,000. The Moto G made a big buzz in the Indian market earlier and I guess it’s time for Moto X to do it. Since the Moto X will be coming with launch offers, pre booking will be provided. Stay tuned for more information and updates. Since Google sold Motorola to Lenovo for $2.91 billion in January, after acquiring it for less than 3 years we cannot expect Moto Maker to come along with Moto X. </p>

<p> First thing we would like to tell you which will rejoice you is that for doing this, you need not need a Rooted device. All thanks to XDA Forum Member gyagapen for coming up with this workaround. The app intelligently manages switching between both your Wi Fi and 3G data connections as you move about, but the catch and the highlight part of this is that it won’t even interrupt your downloads in any manner. If data is used, connectivity will be kept for another 1 minute and If data is NOT used, connectivity will be de activated for 10min. After this, the connectivity will be re-activated and Time On will be started. </p>
<p> Features of Clever Connectivity: </p>
<p> Configuration of ON-OFF cycle (Time On, Time Off, Usage Interval Period) </p>
<p> Disable/Enable connectivity (Wifi/Data/Sync) </p>
<p> Enable/disable management of Data/Wifi connectivity </p>
<p> Sleep Hours: During these hours, all connectivity will deactivated one screen is OFF </p>
<p> Auto Wifi-Off: Wifi will be disabled after after a defined period if screen is OFF and no known networks are available </p>
<p> So, to get started all you need to do is to just download the Clever Connectivity Application from the Google PLAY Store. Do share with us in the comments section just in case if you face any issues as we will try our level best to come out with the same. </p>

<p> First up download Radio3.apk from here to your computer along with the Notepad ++ . Install the Notepad ++ tool in your computer. Also, we are assuming that you know how to decompile and compile APK files. </p>
<p> Up next, decompile the Radio3.apk file. Navigate to smali/com/sonyericsson/fmradio/service/ and then open PhfHandler.smali to open with the Notepad++. </p>
<p> You now need to search for the below mentioned line; </p>
<p> .method public isPhfConnected </p>
<p> Delete the below mentioned line; </p>
<p> if-eqz v0, :cond_0 </p>
<p> Save the file and compile the Radio3.apk to copy the same in your phone. Move the same to the system/apps and set the permission to rw-r-r </p>
<p> So there you go, you can now listen to FM radio without needing to attach the headphone. Do let us know in the comments section just in case if you face any issues in the process of applying this mod. </p>

<p> Focal Camera App for Android brings Customization, HDR and More – Free in Play Store </p>
<p> The Focal Camera app was earlier a part of the Cyanogenmod and it was being sent in the nightly builds of the mod Phase 2, but later the developer of the camera app, Guillaume Lesniak, left the team and has now made the Focal app beta version available for free on the Google Play Store. As you see that the app is in the beta version, you should not be expecting really much from it already but the options given in the app can come to better use when your device’s camera application isn’t providing these options. </p>
<p> To start off, a few options that would be directly available to the users in a long bar, include the following: </p>
<p> Voice Trigger: Saying words like “Cheese”, “Cid”, or “Whiskey” would trigger the Focal app to capture the photo </p>
<p> Burst Mode: Can capture a lot of shots when you keep the shutter key pressed for a long time, with the captures being in multiples of 5 </p>
<p> Video Snapshots: This would make it possible for the users to capture snapshots while recording the videos using the Focal app </p>
<p> HDR Mode </p>
<p> Auto White Balance </p>
<p> Scene Mode – Includes Candlelight, Landscape, Beach, Automatic, Fireworks, HDR </p>
<p> Effects: Includes negative, whiteboard, black & white, Blackboard, Sepia </p>
<p> Color adjustment </p>
<p> Auto-enhancement </p>
<p> A review drawer, by sliding from the top of the screen (in portrait). It shows your latest pictures. </p>
<p> Panorama Capture (Picsquare): As explained by the developer of the app: The Panorama mode as you know it has been greatly enhanced. It works just as it used to work previously in the AOSP camera app, but now it works at a higher resolution to give you the best looking panoramas, and it lets you take panoramas up to 360° (where it used to be 160° in the standard camera app) for stunning pictures of your current location. </p>
<p> There is quite a lot more than what a normal camera app in the mid-range or low-end smartphone would have. The panoramic capture possible to 360-degree is something which even many high-end smartphones fail to provide, and when the app isn’t eating much of the memory and isn’t hampering the performance, that should be a perfect companion to the lens of your smartphone. For many, this app can be used as the main camera app than the default camera app, because one might not want to have a separate app always for adding effects or have some modes. </p>
<p> The Focal Beta app for Android is available for free at the Play Store: Link </p>

<p> This is not forcing an update or anything at all. This is simply manually checking for updates for your device. I have an HTC incredible 2 and I have been doing this for months in hopes of updating to ICS but it comes back with “no updates available” when some people have gotten this update. When you title an article force update and use the verbage work around it means you have a way to update your device eventhogh your carrier has not made it available in your area yet. This is very misleading and probably something most already know how to do to “CHECK” updates. </p>
<p> Must only be for latest phones. Galaxy S i9000 has “Check for Update” but when pressed, checks for update, but Says “No update available” And there are no options for Update via 3G or WiFi on this phone!! Running Gingerbread XWJVN – no updates from Kies either !! Unless rooting phone – no updates!! Cannot be done – even by a “newbie” </p>
<p> Hello. I followed all steps but on “software update” is only “check for update” and “resume update” My USB controller on the SGS Si9000 is brocken so, I can’t use it. Î have Gingerbread 2.3.5 Can you give to me an advice? Thanks. </p>
<p> On my Galaxy Tab there is no option for .software Update on the About screen. The first item is Status. </p>
<p> I wonder if my network have removed this option to prevent updates? </p>
<p> Hi i have huawei u8300 as per ur instructions i tried to check the updates for my phone but unable to find above said ” softere updates” tab in my phone settings. please let meknow the procedure for my phone </p>
<p> please update with the top 10 applications and games of the week from android market </p>
<p> Can you give us any info/hope when the Motorola Photon 4G will receive ICS? The Photon 4G seems to be generally ignored when it comes to Software/Firmware updates from Motorola or modifications from Android Advices. </p>
<p> Is it wat u call Forced OTA update ? This thing can be done even by a newbie who has just started using smart phone. This is the very basic option available and i don’t believe any body would require it. </p>

<p> I use this app. Advanced Task Killer does not help. After I kill unnecessary programs, after some time, the processes are running again in the background. Classic example is Facebook. Whether or not I am logged in to Facebook, it is always running. I am trying to figure of how to stop unnecessary programs running in the background even after they are killed by these task managers (like Adv Task Killer). </p>
<p> I have used another apps to kill processses in android but after some time or after some events they start running again… I need something to kill definitively these apss (like facebook that runs even if I are loget out from my account) </p>
<p> I’m finding all these tips most useful in coming to understand my android. Thanks </p>

<p> Get Free 5GB Storage via Dropbox Accounts – Only HTC Mobiles </p>
<p> Dropbox is growing, growing and growing. Here comes good news from HTC which will make HTC mobile phone users proud. HTC has partnered up with #1 in online cloud storage giant Dropbox. </p>
<p> All the HTC Android mobile phones which will be manufactured from now will come with pre-installed 5 GB of Dropbox storage on cloud to all the users for lifetime apart from the normal free space of 2 GB for every Dropbox user. This news from HTC comes after they first tried with free storage of 3 GB to all the new phones which are HTC Sense 3.5 & above. Also apart from that HTC users can go and visit HTCSense.com website where they need to automatically backup SMS, call history, contacts, data and customizations. </p>
<p> I think HTC has now clearly understood that there is no end to giving priority to add more features and upgrading the existing features to their phone. This looks like a smart strategy because online cloud storage is everyone needs and only few know that integration of Dropbox with Android is real possible. </p>
<p> There is no news from the HTC team about the existing users will enjoy this advantage or not. But I think there is nothing to disappoint because you will get 2 GB free if you sign up with Dropbox and the limit can be increased by referring more users to with your referral ID. Note that 8 GB of data can be added with any of the free Dropbox ID and other limitations may apply. </p>

<p> This is pretty nice… the free 2Gb dropbox account doesn’t go very far with an Android phone and needing to sync backups, music, and pictures. People will certainly not buy the phone because of this, but it is another feather in HTC’s cap and broadens the very nice overall HTC Sense offering. </p>
<p> As for the Wildfire, it does not have Sense 3.5, so it would obviously not get this (at least yet). I think the Wildfire S has below Sense 3… I have the Desire S w/ Sense 3. </p>
<p> this promotion is not so lucrative that people end up buying a HTC phone just because of Dropbox 5GB free space.. </p>

<p> “Free App of the Week”, now available in Google Play Store – Download Now </p>
<p> Google is all out to offer amazon app store like experience when it comes to offering free app. Yes, on the lines of amazon’s free app of the day, Google is now offering a free app of the week across the globe in the Play Store. While Amazon’s App store is nowhere close to the Google Play Store in terms of app downloads and revenues, this may be one of the new offerings from Google for an extra edge when compared with Apple App Store which doesn’t have free app of the week/ day. </p>
<p> As shown in the screen captures, the “Free App of the Week” can be accessed from the path, “Apps > Home > Family” to see the below screen captures. While for some users the free app is deep inside many levels, for some its there right at the first screen the moment you launch the Google Play Store app. The 1st App of the week is from PBS Kids which will be changed next week. While the banner doesn’t suggest which app is being offered for free, the moment you tap on the banner the purchase prompt pops up instead of showing more information. </p>
<p> This app is otherwise priced at $2.99 (Rs.XXX), but is now being offered as free. This week’s app is Daniel Tiger Daniel Tiger Grr-ific Feelings, you can search the same if you need more info about the same. Please note that, if the app is free, it will be mentioned as free. There are some cases reported by users in few forums that it’s still being showed as a paid app. In such cases, the full price of the app will be deducted. So make sure about it before you choose to buy. </p>
<p> It will be interesting to see on one of the policy in Google which says that an app can’t be switched from free to paid and back again. This seems to be an exception for offering free paid app of the week. </p>

<p> This app worked perfectly. I spent 3 days trying to get sip2sip,ipkall,pbxes, and google chat to play nice. installed this app and it worked instantly. Thanks. </p>
<p> I have an american Number, but currently out of the country. Can I use this in order to receive calls on my phone? Meaning, anyone in the US can call me and the call will be forwarded to Google Voice or Groove IP? Do I get a virtual number so anyone can call? </p>
<p> Google Voice requires USA phone number which the website will verify for the authentication of your Google Voice account. So it clearly means it will work in United States only. </p>
<p> When is the link to the article that explains how to call for FREE and not for 1.99? </p>
<p> The calls after purchasing Groove IP is priced at $ 4.99 are Free. Investment is of Groove IP Android application. </p>

<p> i purchase this phone in 6000.its take too long time in charging,very slow processor </p>
<p> Rs.1650 along with taxes is way good option for those who haven’t been able to buy such a lucrative phone with all the 18,000 bucks hard cash. coz for some its abit difficult. on top it has a very good touch screen. but yeah, keep the sar level in mind fellas.. 🙂 or u might get knocked down.. theres a problem about how to add a device to our gmail account in the android market app. anybody with the solution ?? reply asap ! i”m gonna buy this phone.!! </p>
<p> SID blackberry storm3, nokia 9300i, samsung e250 and much more… B) </p>
<p> If I would have to get it on credit card EMI than why this mobile.. there are plenty other android phones in the market and better than this one.. MTS guys are not giving it on per month rental for that they are asking for ITR of 5 lakhs, can you believe and one more thing I want to disclose what I got to know from them (MTS Outlet) is taxes are not included in mentioned prices above so it will charge you more than they are disclosing.. so beware of getting fooled by free free options.. take care all!! </p>
<p> what’s will be correct it’s good or not good, becaz i purchage of this phone after 1 days… </p>
<p> it is not a 3G phone i think ,can any 3G phone is available with the proposed plan </p>
<p> right now i am using idea and i want to transfer my idea no to the MTS can it is possible ????? </p>
<p> and secondly can there are also other handsets of HTC available with the scheme ???? </p>
<p> Dont buy this phone, battery is so terrible, even you have to charge it 3 times in a day for 1 hour each, USB charger wont work at all it take more then 4 hour to charge from USB, Processor is so low speed, Even the most poplar games Angry Bird you cannot run properly and the screen will jerk while playing. </p>
<p> Last and the best they won’t provide you HeadPhone with this phone, so the phone is hell & dont think you will get this phone at 1500 as the company claim you have to pay 150 rupees extra as 10 % tax, so the cost will be 1650 rupees per month and after one year 19800 rupees approx. </p>
<p> howz the review of this handset….any one using this phone can you please update us about the known facts </p>

<p> Make Free Voip Calls on Android WiFi or 3G </p>
<p> A voice call and video conference has becoming the essential need now a day with the digital media. Where its your smartphone or tablet PC, the text chatting is now ruled with video chat. </p>
<p> Viber is an application for Android and iPhone which allows you to make free phone calls and send messages to the users who have installed Viber. When you are using Viber, it makes free calls to other Viber users and the sound quality is good enough than a regular call. It’s not tricky and its doesn’t contain any annoying ads. </p>
<p> App like Viber is an interesting VoIP and messaging app that was launched on Apple products last year. And this year we have app for Android too available in the Android market for download. You can call any users worldwide who is on Viber and also text message them. The Viber is completely free and it doesn’t require any additional in application purchase. </p>
<p> The good thing I like about Viber is that this application unlike Skype, Windows Live Messenger or Fring doesn’t require people to add buddies. It behaves like your phone and if you know your friend’s phone number then you are ready to go. Viber uses your phone number as your identity and lets you make free Viber voice calls. Now to receive a phone call you should always make sure that your Viber app is running on your mobile phone and you don’t kill it. </p>
<p> For the best experience and voice call quality you must be using Android 2.2 and above versions. It is readily available for iPhone but Android version is currently in beta stage. </p>
<p> Provide you mobile number and click on Continue. It will then ask for permissions to access your address book. Tap OK button without any hesitation. </p>
<p> Now then you can call any phone number present in your mobile number with a simple call or with a call using the Viber. The Viber call is free but your operator call would be charged accordingly to your plans. </p>
<p> Here is how the call interface would look like when you make a outgoing call or receive an incoming call </p>
<p> As you see, I am now connected on to a call with a variety of options in between call. It includes mute, hold, Switch to GSM, Contact, speaker and the End button. </p>
<p> The good thing which I like about Viber is that it has excellent voice quality over the phone and it offers completely free calls to your near and dear ones. The Viber app works perfectly with WiFi or 3G and as it is available for in Apple App Store, you can also make calls to the users who are using Apple products. So something in store for cross platform voice calls. </p>

<p> Fujitsu Demos WaterProof Tablet PC at CeBIT 2012 </p>
<p> At Mobile World Congress Fujitsu showcased Arrows their water proof Android phone. Though this phone hasn’t enough publicity, inspired Fujitsu itself to come up with a waterproof and dust proof Android tablet. We understand that people who work for construction industry have problem of dust going through their phone or their phone has chances of falling in water, mud. The mobile manufacturers have realized that and most of them have come up with their own products. Samsung earlier launched XCover smartphone, Panasonic recently came up with Eluga smartphone at Mobile World Congress and recently Caterpillar Cat B 10 smartphone was announced. </p>
<p> Fujitsu WaterProof Android Tablet </p>
<p> Fujitsu inspired by the demand of IP67 certified smartphones (dust proof, scratch proof and water proof devices), at CeBIT tech fair at Hanover, Germany showcased an Android tablet with live demo of it. This water proof tablet from Fujitsu created a buzz in the CeBIT tech fair. This tablet is completely waterproof down to three meters i.e., 10 feet’s maximum. We don’t have any specifications how longer it can withstand in water. Well ofcourse this is not the first tablet launched by Fujitsu, they previously have 7 inches Lifebook T730, Stylistic Q550 and Lifebook TH40 but all these products went unnoticed in the market. Fujitsu believes that this product would do it for them to gain some popularity. </p>
<p> Going through the specifications of this tablet, it will be a 7 inches tablet powered with Android operating system with 2.3 Gingerbread. This tablet would be budget friendly and will be affordable by all. Keeping the price in mind, we expect the specifications of it on a lighter side. </p>
<p> However Fujitsu Android tablet is right now available only in Japan and the chairman admits that this tablet will be made available internationally. Also in news, Samsung showcased the pink Galaxy Tab at CeBIT. </p>

If revone reboots the device (we’ll pretend this isn’t an undiagnosed random crash) please wait 2 minutes then try again from step 2 of “cd /data/local/tmp”. If revone reports that you need to reboot and try again please reboot and try again from step 2. Once the device is successfully prepared for S-Off, open other ADB Shell and change to /data/local/tmp directory. Now, all you need to do is to instruct to Revone about the unlock Status by running the status of </p>
<p> ./revone -s 0 –u </p>
<p> In the meanwhile, you can also make use of the below mentioned commands for your use; </p>
<p> * -u – Unlock the device * -l – Lock the device (as if it was never unlocked) * -r – Relock the device (mark the device as relocked) * -t – Reset the device’s tamper flag. </p>
<p> Assuming that Revone has been successful, you need to enter the command as “adb reboot bootloader”. Now, re run the Revone to remove the TAMPERED from your HBoot Screen by entering the command; </p>
<p> ./revone –t </p>
<p> Tip: Just in case if the device refuses to turn ON, you will need to long press the power button and then re apply the firmware update again. </p>
<p> So there you go, you have now successfully achieved the S-Off in your HTC One Smartphone. Do let us know in the comments section just in case if you face any issues in the process of S-OFF as we will try our level best to address the same. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy S4 Vs Galaxy Note 2 – Detailed Comparison </p>
<p> Though Samsung Galaxy Note 2 is only for the Niche market while Galaxy S IV is for the masses, it will be little unfair to compare both of them but unfortunately both of them are having the screen size of around 5.0 inches and people are spoilt for the choices between these both. So, to make things simple for all the Galaxy Note 2 lovers and Galaxy S IV dreamers, we have compared the features and specs of both these neck to neck with the help of close to 25 parameters. Not just on specs, Samsung has actually focused more on the features this time compared to mere hardware specs which is a very good sign as HTC One too gives a tough for Galaxy S4 smartphone. </p>
<p> Built Quality, Look & Feel: Both the handsets, Galaxy Note 2 and Galaxy S IV looks somewhat similar, but when you talk of built quality, looks and feel then Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone takes it away the point here. Samsung Galaxy Note 2 too is not bad when talked about the built quality, look and feel but when it’s compared with the latest flagship model, it gives bow down to S IV. </p>
<p> Performance & Screen Quality: Till the time the flexible displays makes an appearance, we can’t actually figure out the major difference between the AMOLED range of displays in high end Galaxy devices but Galaxy S4 screen looks much brighter and vivid as it comes with the latest Super AMOLED 4.99 inches of screen. But all thanks to the PPI as S4 comes with Ful HD resolution and a PPI of 441 compared to the PPI of 267 of Samsung Galaxy Note II. When talked about the performance, then this Galaxy Note 2 comes with the Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A9 while Samsung Galaxy SIV comes with the Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 processor. </p>
<p> Memory: Samsung Galaxy SIV comes with 2GB of RAM and Samsung Galaxy Note 2 too comes with 2GB of RAM but when you talk of internal memory, then Samsung Galaxy Note 2 comes with 16/32/64 GB of internal memory and Galaxy S IV comes with the same internal memory options 16/32/64 GB. Both Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and Samsung Galaxy S IV comes with the external memory card slot. </p>
<p> Tabular Comparison of Galaxy S4 and Galaxy Note 2: </p>
<p> Battery Life: While Samsung Galaxy S4 comes with the 2600 Mah of Battery Life, Samsung Galaxy Note 2 comes with mere 3100Mah of battery life. So, in a nutshell if you are into 3G gaming, internet browsing, music playback, a few Youtube videos, then it’s better to opt for Samsung Note 2. But with bigger screen of Galaxy Note 2, it might just drain the battery faster than the Galaxy S IV. </p>
<p> Pricing and Verdict: No doubt that Samsung Galaxy S IV will outsell Samsung Galaxy Note 2, its well left for users to leave the verdict in the comments section. Do let us know your thoughts on the Galaxy S IV and the Galaxy Note 2 smartphones in the comments section below and which one you would like to choose for yourself? </p>
<p> OH WOW! so that 1-millionth of a second difference in processing speed will so much affect my life!! NOT!! </p>
<p> Oh please, please, please get an editor. This gibberish-laced, error-filled, repetitious pile of reheated PR could have been turned into a real (albeit much shorter) article. </p>
<p> True that , i thought it was going to be an actual comparison when it just turned out to be a mere table. </p>

<p> the standard version of sg4 has same processor as htc one which is a snapdragon 600 and the htc runs much more fluid then the sg4 </p>
<p> Hi is it true that HTC One will have MPix rear camera? I had better in a nokia 5 years ago…. </p>
<p> HTC One is the best piece to flaunt because of its aluminium unibody, where as S4’s plastic body is seen on several cheap handsets making it seems to one of them. </p>
<p> The s4 has got amazing specs, but the design isn’t premium,(plastic). The HTC one may look incredible, but it just hasn’t got the immense power and the megapixels for its camera comparing it to the s4. In my opinion Samsung’s flagship phone has already won the smartphone contest, just waiting for the next iPhone 5s or 6 to challenge the s4. The Xperia Z, LG Optimus G Pro, Google X Phone are still yet to be considered (or waited for) if you don’t want an s4… </p>
<p> Dont go by “4 MP” tag on HTC One. Its not mega pixel. Its micro pixel!! Its supposed to take better pictures than a normal 12 mega pixel camera. </p>
<p> Nope, they are called “Ultrapixel”, not “Micropixel” (that do not exist) </p>
<p> Please guys, pay attention to what you write in comments but ALSO in your articles, thank you. </p>
<p> Why do you say that the S4 will have a quad core processor, when it will have an octo processor? Regards Wez </p>
<p> It has two types of processors and they would be available depending on the location. </p>

<p> Last Updated: 15 March, 2013 @ 6:54 by Amit Bhawani The Samsung Galaxy S4 is made official, with the rumors not going wrong totally as the device has got most of what was being speculated, the 5-inch 1080p display and the processor being 1.6GHz Exynos Octa-core chip or a 1.9GHz quad-core Qualcomm based on the region we are located at. The display is similar to most of the recent competitive devices’ ones like the Sony Xperia Z, having 5-inch 1080p display with the pixel density 441 PPI and the resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. </p>
<p> The Samsung Unpacked event showed the device to be 7.9mm thick, and the battery packed inside the S4 would be of 2600 mAh capacity. It is going to arrive into the market from April, and the pricing would be known only then. The connectivity options that would be supported by the Samsung Galaxy S4 are WiFi 802.11ac at a/b/g/n, IR blaster for NFC, Bluetooth 4.0, MHL 2.0 support. </p>
<p> The 13-megapixel camera of the Samsung Galaxy S4 has a f/ 2.2 aperture and autofocus, and there’s a 2-megapixel front facing camera included in the device. One of the new features in the Galaxy range is the dual-video capture mode where the videos can be captured on both the cameras simultaneously. Dual Video Call mode is another addition to the list of the new features, where the two cameras are activated when you are video calling. And as it was rumored all around a few days back, Samsung made a few advancements to the “Smart” feature bringing Smart Pause, Smart Scroll and the other features like Air View, Group Play etc. </p>
<p> We’ll share all the details and the actual comparisons with the best Android 1080p smartphones soon to give a better idea of whether the S4 can be called the superior of all the devices in the market or not, especially comparing with the HTC One, the Sony Xperia Z. </p>
<p> Earlier: While the March 14th is coming near by, speculations are getting hotter and hotter about the probable specs and features of this device. if we go by the latest round of specs which was revealed by the AnTuTu Benchmarks, then Galaxy S IV I9500 is expected to come up with the below mentioned specs. You can refer to the series of rumors which are just below this confirmed specs list which are summed up below. The best part of the Galaxy S4 is the HD Screen along with the new Wi Fi standard support which is Wi Fi ac which too is available with the HTC One smartphone. </p>
<p> Two New & Important Features which would be coming up in this device are : 1. Out Touch Slide Gallery 2. Top Invisible Notification Bar </p>
<p> We will keep you updated with all the latest specs of Galaxy S4 as in when we get from credible sources only at AndroidAdvices.com. Stay tuned. </p>
<p> Updated on March, 02, 2013 We at Android Advices have got a few insider tips on the upcoming Galaxy S4 Android Smart Phone which is the next flagship model from Samsung. These are confirmed for the upcoming device and would be counted as the main selling factors for the device. </p>
<p> Smart Scroll </p>
<p> Air View Touch </p>
<p> Two Camera’s work (Front and Rear) simultaneously for 360* capture </p>
<p> Qualcomm Processor </p>
<p> New type of Gallery with awesome Grouping of Photos </p>
<p> This clearly shows that Samsung is working on the 360 degrees features for the camera which would be a unique feature compared to their current portfolio and that could help them in making this device look superior too. Though the 360 degree outputs cannot be generally be viewed on the PC unlike a normal photo capture because it offers you with a option to zoom in and out around the location and also move around, hence it would mostly be limited to smart phone usage or special applications which allow you to render them on the PC. </p>
<p> It would also host the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and would also come with a better grouping of pictures in the photo gallery for the users which could be an additional feature. </p>
<p> Update on Feb 20 2013 : Rumors are flowing in that Samsung is going to unveil the Samsung Galaxy S IV smartphone on March 14th, the Unpacked event, although both the event and the phone’s update is not officially confirmed by the company yet. Samsung might not be sending the invitations already because of the MWC 2013 event, after which the actual invites could be sent for the event. The sources also said that the phone would go on sale from Early April, and Europe would be the first place to receive the device, followed by the Asian countries, and the US, Australia and African markets will have to wait until May/June for the availability there. </p>
<p> Update on Dec 26th 2012 Sam Mobile has confirmed that Samsung is working on a couple new devices, and the next flagship device from them would be the GT-I9500 model, and this probably should be the Galaxy S IV as the Galaxy Note that is being worked on, would be the GT-I5100 and Samsung is due to come up with the next Galaxy phone next year. </p>
<p> It would be interesting to see whether the phone would have the Android or TIZEN OS in it, and if its TIZEN, that should be the first handset from Samsung having the new interface. </p>
<p> Update on Dec 12th 2012 Update: The Samsung Galaxy S IV won’t be probably available at the CES 2013, and we are noticing that from the teaser video the company released. CNet is reporting that the teaser video has shown Samsung preparing quite a lot, but hasn’t showcased anything or concentrated much in the Mobile phone category, and so the CES could not be the time when the S4 would be unveiled. We could expect in next in the Mobile World Congress 2013. </p>
<p> A report from the Wall Street Journal stated that Samsung is busy in the development of flexible displays for the handheld devices, and the expectation is that this technology could come in the next upcoming Galaxy device, i.e. the Samsung Galaxy S IV. There is also a speculation that the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display could be integrated into the technology where the screen could be bent without breaking. A picture on Patent Bolt showed the technology that Samsung is working on. One of the best things about the technology is that the display won’t just be bendable, but can be stretched too. </p>
<p> If Samsung includes this flexible displays into the Galaxy S4 screen, there could be nothing beating it in the near time after the launch. If it doesn’t come in any of the Galaxy devices, we could still be seeing something new and interesting from Samsung. </p>
<p> Update on 20th Nov 2012 – Several rumors have come in, with a few strong ones claiming that there could be an unveiling done by the Samsung guys during the CES 2013, with the Samsung Galaxy S IV having a 4.99 inch screen, and quad-core 2.0GHz Exynos 5450 chipset. According to the Korean sources, the company is working on a device that would have those specs and at the Galaxy S4 is expected to be made public by that time, so we can connect the dots. Another expectation as seen earlier is the 13 megapixel camera, and the 1080p display. </p>
<p> Update on 16th Nov 2012 – CES is nearing and we are getting to hear more and more true/false news about the products that are going to be displayed there. The Samsung Galaxy S IV is expected, and now with a 1080p HD display, or is it just a false rumor to keep customers interested and keep themselves away from getting the Droid DNA until the S4 is launched? We are not sure about it, but news is that Samsung is working on the displays that boast the screen resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. One of the Korean newspapers claimed to have heard from one of the Samsung’s officials that the 1080p displays that the company is working on, would be quite thin and have a better refresh rate and a low power consumption. </p>
<p> Another doubt here is whether Samsung is really working on these displays for the inclusion in the Galaxy S IV or any other high-end product that might make its way into the smartphone world pretty soon. Less than 2 months left for the CES and we are excited. </p>
<p> Update on 13th Nov 2012 – A camera module leaked in the wild seems to be for one of the upcoming Samsung devices, and that most probably is the camera of the Samsung Galaxy S IV, because there are already a lot of speculations that the camera of the S4 would be a 13-megapixel one. The capture resolution was found to be 4208 x 3120 pixels and the included parameters are – 8.5(L) x 8.5(W) x 5.9(H). It’s something just found recently in one of the documents from the company, and the expected date of release of the phone is Mobile World Congress, during the last week of February 2013. </p>
<p> Update on 06th Nov 2012 – The Samsung Galaxy S4 is going to be powered by the 1080p HD LCD screen and not the AMOLED one, as what the Sam Mobile confirms. The reason being claimed is that the manufacturer hasn’t been able to prepare an AMOLED display with such a high resolution, thus would see the LCD as a better option. LCDs are said to be quite vibrant in colors, but AMOLEDs have been quite energy efficient at the same time, so both the displays have their own advantages and disadvantages. We would see it as a disappointment from many if there is no AMOLED display. </p>
<p> Update on 31/10/2012 – We’ve got some news about the processor that the Galaxy S IV would be coming in with. It could have the Exynos “Adonis” 28 nanometer quad-core ARM Cortex A15 CPU, and Samsung is testing out the processors and would be doing the mass production and that would probably be into the Samsung Galaxy S4 in the early months of 2013. They have set the codename as Adonis, which is to mean something about the high-performance, low-power. </p>
<p> Keep checking out, there should be some exciting news coming soon. It’s already the end of the year! </p>
<p> Update on 04/10/2012 – With just over 20 million Galaxy S III smartphones sold in mere 100 days, it now seems like Samsung is working hard to come up with a much powerful smartphone which will be dubbed as Samsung Galaxy S4 rolled out in the coming months, may be in MWC 2013 or in CES 2013. For all those who had anticipated the 13MP camera in Galaxy S3, the wait for the same could just get over in Galaxy S4 as according to few leaks it shows that Samsung is working on the 13 MP camera sensor which is way powerful than compared to the incumbents. As per the leaks, the 13 MP camera if true will be capable of shooting images with 4208×3120 resolution. One can also refer to the below images for more details about the leaks. We will keep you posted on all the latest on Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone here on AndroidAdvices. </p>
<p> Img Source : androidcommunity.com —————————————————————————————————————– Update on 17/09/2012 – Samsung and Apple are fierce rivals for the leadership in smart phone. The degree got hotter when the US based company launched iPhone 5 last week in response to Samsung Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note 2. iPhone 5 received a mixed response from its consumers and industry experts as the device lacked innovative features. But still iPhone 5 is a better smart phone launched in competition with Galaxy S III. </p>
<p> Presently the Samsung is the #1 manufacturer leaving behind Apple and Nokia in the race. For Samsung to be king, it required their devices like Galaxy S, S II and S III released on time to compete in market. The Samsung Galaxy S III broke the record very recently by crossing 20 million unit sales in course of 100 days since the launch beating iPhone record. </p>
<p> Every year we see a new Galaxy S series successor available, and the debut of Galaxy S set the tone for Samsung initially. Furthermore when Galaxy S II was launched in the market, the scenario for Samsung even got better with device topping the charts in terms of sales. And with Samsung Galaxy S III in the market, the launch event got so bigger in comparison with Apple iPhone launch events. </p>
<p> Samsung Electronics is planning to launch iPhone 5 killer in coming months and device should be definitely Galaxy S 4 as expected. But as we say, it could easily take another 6 months for the Korean giant to produce a device which is competitive & better in terms of hardware design and configuration. </p>
<p> Samsung is ready to launch Galaxy S4 during the world’s biggest exhibition for telecom and mobile companies to exhibit their latest development and we receive reports of Galaxy S III successor to be available at Samsung booth. The officials pointed out that their new flagship model will be released in nine months after the May 2012 debut of Samsung Galaxy S III. It will be more enough to curb the latest Apple iPhone development and device should be easily capable with the LTE network. </p>
<p> Samsung is king in the Asian market and it has gained a bigger market share in Europe. The only country where it got hit is the homeland of Apple i.e., United States but for Samsung that doesn’t matter as its main rival didn’t concentrate on many countries expect United States. For Samsung everything is under their control, from Super AMOLED OLED display to Exynos S4 processor, they have everything right infront of them to come out with a device with on time and they are capable deliver the number of output device within the expected time. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S 4 Specifications </p>
<p> The Korean giant is still to decide on what could be the exact Galaxy S 4 device looks like, whether it will include the flexible display technology or use the Super AMOLED Plus display. So far its design is kept the same with rounded corner concept but we might see some changes claimed by one of the Samsung’s local officials. </p>
<p> We see Samsung Galaxy S 4 certainly with better specifications and inclusion of quad core Exynos processor and better hardware configuration but nothing were released at this moment as it’s too early to comment on the device. </p>
<p> Market researchers and experts views Galaxy S4 a clear message to Apple as they are capable to widen its lead over Apple leaving behind the legal disputes. Samsung is expecting that it’s device will cross the 30 million unit sales in 100 days to break their record of Galaxy S III which was achieved very recently. </p>
<p> So what Apple is doing? US leading smart phone manufacturer is seeking a ban on 8 of the Galaxy Series Samsung which includes top sellers like Galaxy S, S II, S III, Galaxy Note, Galaxy Note 2 and few more tablets. While Apple looks to take copyright infringements case to next level, nothing worries Samsung from producing Samsung Galaxy S4. [Some Info via koreatimes] </p>

<p> S4 has been launched. Looks really really good! I am buying one..already pre-ordered but the truth of how good (or bad) it is will not be revealed until it is in the consumers (my) hand. Stay tuned…I will give my expert (drip under pressure) review, in a couple of months. Until then…everything is just conjecture. </p>
<p> the device is good, but not big differences from other devices, for me I am interested with dual camera and how it function </p>
<p> It’s hard to beat Samsung for smartphones and it obivious it has took up the whole market and apple should try to build some innovative features rather than just trying to finding out errors and obligations with samsung. </p>
<p> Hope that the galaxy s4, will not be big as the note and make the battery life much longer. </p>
<p> S4 IS GOING TO BE THE BEST PHONE EVER ITS OWESOME THE LOOK AND ITS MUSH THINER THAN S3 ITS WICKED I AM WAITING TO HAVE ONE . </p>
<p> 2nd picture is not the original . its the picture of asus nexus 7 & the screen is changed. </p>
<p> S3 us bullshit, if S4 is going to look like S2, that’s good. but the S4 pic above, Seriously. that’s ICS Nexus design. I think (Sure) it’s gonna be jelly bean or other awesome future software. </p>
<p> Stuff the 13mp camera in S4 – they’re totally superfluous if the lens and image sensor doesn’t increase in size. The fixation with megapixels (they do NOT equal power) is so totally misplaced. Just look at the purple haze problem of the newest iPhone. </p>
<p> And don’t you feel cheated when they produce a new phone when you’ve just shelled out hundreds on the S3? </p>
<p> Exactly! I have an S2, which I really like. However no phone caner compares to the Nokia N8, which I previously owned. </p>
<p> A larger image receiver Than anything else and a Carl Zeiss lens…gorgeous combination. </p>
<p> Looks cooool…!!!! But most of the specifications and also the pics looks fake as i am seeing them from over last 1 year. </p>
<p> The new King will be coming.. just waiting for the next best World Smartphone ever.. 🙂 </p>
<p> You think that it will be a “best smartphone”? When it will appear, another one is in project 😀 </p>
<p> hi.. i hv a Samsung SHW-M250K Galaxy S II phone bought from korea. now i m at srilanka. some of its features not compatible in srilanka.( sms .. bluetooth.. ) it has gingerbread 2.3.3 pls help me. </p>
<p> As far as im concern samsung is king and will always be the galaxy series rules only one gripe tho the s4 should be a touch smaller than s3 more like the s2 size (samsund pls dont getany bigger) </p>
<p> Samsung is best.we need better graphics for games,more RAM,more speed from processor.i am talking and advicing also what my friends,relators want.samsung must do it if they want to beat iphone 5.Apple is worthless as it is fighting over nonsense matters like ban. </p>
<p> I can only say that the consumer wants something new. Especially in terms of UI and reliability as well. No doubt samsung previous models made extraodinary exposure in market. But they need to build something new. Consumers have already used CM10 but now we want to see something new in upcoming android samsung galaxy s4 model. The whole old firmwares was good for old version but there must be something new for this one. </p>
<p> i believe that the Samsung series are awesome, Apple is stupid for tryin to sue for Samsung having rounded edges on phones, are you serious, SAMSUNG was out before Apple, is more respected and used than apple, Apple is jus being a hater cause Samsung is the better phone, hell in my eyes the all the Samsung phones are better than all the Apple phones, </p>
<p> yes , now this is the only thing samsung can do. galaxy S 3 blows iphone 5 out of water. it has got much better specs and will be supported (updates) for atleast 2-3 years and not to forget you can always flash it with custom firmwares. yum. and jelly bean and future android updates are going to be much better and smoother. and i think that we shouldnt compare the 2 phones seeing the specs coz galaxy s 3 is a lot better. lolz </p>
<p> Galaxy S4 will come But the picture we are viewing is 100 percent wrong, Samsung never make a mistake to design like this </p>
<p> If it comes down to it: anything but the ugly variable-radius curvature of the S3 would be better… </p>
<p> Lucky that Samsung seems to have noticed that looks ugly, cause they did not repeat the mistake on the Note II, which looks fine. </p>
<p> Tsais: You hit the nail right on the head..! Can’t stand that pretentious curved side profile … </p>
<p> I support u on the view of screen size. In my opinion they will use there own mobile platform for Samsung GS4 because Android platform is highly effected by malware attacks, last year Android devices were basically affected by either SMS Trojans or online applications . This year the volume of malware attacks on Android platform has surged by a factor of 41 within a year period. </p>
<p> what? Android is not badly affected by malware,there are also plenty of free anti virus/malware programs about to protect your phone.Samsung would be foolish to use its own operating system as Android us vastly more popular </p>
<p> I have had my S2 for over a year now and I have not had a single incident of malware. These cases of malware (if they even exist) are probably as a result of sideloading apps from the internet and not reading its permissions before installing. </p>
<p> Its just the media needing to fill space on slow news days, talking about malware. Never had any problem by simply installing a free software called LookOut. I should mention even when I didn’t have LookOut, I never had any malware problem… </p>

<p> Galaxy S4 Vs LG Nexus 4 – Flagship Models Gets Compared </p>
<p> LG Nexus 4 smartphone was earlier launched by LG and Google to mark the launch of Jellybean Android firmware and now with the launch of Samsung’s Galaxy S4 smartphone, the real fight has begun. With Google subsidizing the Nexus 4 heavily, Samsung is all here to capture the lost sheen in the last few months which was the result of Nexus 4 getting sold out. So, to make things simple for you, we thought of comparing Nexus 4 and Galaxy S4 with the help of a tabular specs. </p>
<p> Built Quality, Look & Feel: Speaking of Built quality, LG and Google had taken efforts in building a superb smartphone which unfortunately Samsung has failed to match the same with its S IV smartphone. But when it comes to the Feel, then Samsung Galaxy S4 takes it away for its sleekness. For a detailed thickness and dimensions analysis, we have tabulated below. Samsung Galaxy S4 comes with the thickness of 7.9mm while LG Nexus 4 comes with 9.1mm thickness. </p>
<p> Performance & Screen Quality: With Quad-core 1.5 GHz Krait processor, LG Nexus 4 may feel marginally slower than that of Galaxy S4’s Quad-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A15 processor, but when the difference in cost between is 2 times then obviously Nexus 4 provides value for money. Also, screen quality of Galaxy S4 is way better than LG Nexus 4 as it will even be foolishness to compare the screen quality of Nexus 4 and of Galaxy S4 for obvious reasons (IPS and AMOLED). Nexus 4 comes with the 318 ppi pixel density while Samsung Galaxy S4 comes with 441 PPI which is very huge. </p>
<p> Memory: Samsung Galaxy S4 comes with 2GB of RAM and LG Nexus 4 too comes with 2GB of RAM but when you talk of internal memory, then LG Nexus 4 comes with 8/16 GB of internal memory and Galaxy S4 comes with 16/32/64 GB storage options. While LG Nexus 4 doesn’t come with the external memory card slot, Samsung Galaxy S4 comes with the external memory card slot which can be extended up to a whopping 64GB. </p>
<p> Battery Life: While Samsung Galaxy S4 comes with the 2600 Mah of Battery Life, LG Nexus 4 comes with mere 2100Mah of battery life. So, in a nutshell if you are into 3G gaming, internet browsing, music playback, a few Youtube videos, then it’s better to opt for Samsung Galaxy S4. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S4 Scores in Battery Life when compared to Nexus 4 as it’s not just removable but also comes with additional battery life of a whopping 500 Mah. </p>
<p> Pricing, Availability and Verdict: No doubt that Samsung Galaxy S4 will outsell LG Nexus 4, its well left for users to leave the verdict in the comments section. All thanks to the poor marketing strategy by LG as despite huge demand, it failed to increase the supplies to meet the demand. Samsung Galaxy S4 comes in two exciting colors which are White Frost, Black Mist while Galaxy Nexus comes in single color which is Premium Black. </p>
<p> We just hope that LG increases its capacity to cater the people who can’t afford to buy Galaxy S4. </p>

<p> S4 – Higher PPI, bigger screen size, bigger int memory option, ext sd Card option, bigger AND removable battery, bigger Megapixel camera and has high speed “ac” wifi built-in. Not bad specs in comparison to the Nexus 4, which is only much cheaper because of Google subsidies. </p>
<p> $349 for my Nexus 4 vs. $699 for the Galaxy S4. Is the Galaxy worth twice the value. I think not! </p>
<p> Finally Nexus 4 is future android version proof which S4 is not. Therefore Nexus 4 will be better in long run. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy S5 Tip: Disable S Voice Shortcut for Faster Home Button Response </p>
<p> Today the Samsung Galaxy S5, the latest flagship from Samsung has been released and on this note I would like to give a tip that will make you Samsung’s Smart phone home button bit more responsive if you feel if it s lagging a bit than it was when it came out of the box. There are many Smart phones that face this issue and this list includes the Galaxy S5 also. </p>
<p> Many of the Samsung devices have the S Voice feature that takes voices commands and it can be activated just by double tapping the home key. So the problem is when you press the home button the system will be waiting if you would give the second tap and in the process we feel its bit slow in responding. </p>
<p> The S Voice feature is a good enough feature that lets you to search content on the web quickly just by voice commands and by this but it makes you wait when you are pressing the home button so, to solve this issue you can just turn off or disable this S Voice shortcut by heading in to the S voice and double tapping the shortcut or go to the app drawer and you will find a menu button on the top right corner, then go to Wake-up option and Open the via home key and disable it. </p>
<p> By doing this you can find that your device is responding faster than it used to respond before the S voice was disabled. So many of you might be wondering how to use the S Voice feature, well you can still do that by tapping the S Voice from the app drawer and the Galaxy S5 users can find this option via toolbox feature that is given to it. So this is a small tip that will work on many of the Samsung devices and we would be coming up with many other tips in our future posts. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy S5 rumored to get new Multi-hovering Technology – Details </p>
<p> The Rumored Samsung Galaxy S5 that is going to be the latest flagship model of the company is expected to get the new Synaptics technology that will be improving the accuracy for the finger hovering aspect of screen input that has bought along features like the Air Gesture and Air View. </p>
<p> This new Synaptic’s technology is an advanced technology that will be able to detect movement of the hand from as little as 15mm and it can go up to 30mm above the display screen. This is not all we got from this technology, we have something more as per the Korean media, claming that multi-hovering will be the hero of the day as it will be able to recognize part of palm as well as the fingers. </p>
<p> This input method will be able to detect more than on finger at a time giving Samsung the idea of using it in many innovative ways which will be a game changing in the field of gestures inputs. Earlier the Air Gesture and Air View were having a great impact as seen n in the Galaxy S4 and Note 3 devices but this multi-hovering technology is going to be something different from all these enhancing the 3D gaming. </p>
<p> There were other rumors also about the latest flagship Galaxy S5 that it would be having a 2560 x 1440p resolution on its display and will back a 20 MP camera with iris scanner and also a 2900 mAh battery with rapid charging technology. It will be coming with all the goodie from the latest Android 4.4 KitKat and top of it will be the Samsung new TouchWiz interface. </p>
<p> Samsung is planning to introduce few other gesture control features like tracking the head movement of the users while browsing a web page on the device. SamMobile claims that the front camera will be able to divide the user’s image into various sections and observe the change in the section and carry out the function. However we need to wait and see what the device will be. </p>

<p> Samsung Could Merge Galaxy S5 Zoom Camera & S5 Active Smart Phone </p>
<p> The Korean electronics Giant is reportedly starting to merge its mobile and camera to bring an all new improvement in the Smart phone segment. This merge up will definitely be a big boost for Smart phone segment and many photographers will love it, also for people who hate to carry the Smart phone as well as the camera with them in their outings. </p>
<p> There are reports claiming that Samsung may come up with a Zoom model of the Galaxy S5 with camera capabilities. These reports were based on an Indian import database that showed the listing of the SM-C115 Samsung mobile Camera. Samsung has plans to release multiple variants of the upcoming flagship Galaxy S5 so that it can be appealing to many customers to perpetuate their uses. From the multiple variants two of the variants being the Galaxy S4 Active and Galaxy S5 Zoom. </p>
<p> Earlier Samsung has released the Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S4 Zoom models and also the Mini version of it, that was cheaper. The S4 Zoom was water and dust resistant device and even its successor S5 should be expected to be the same. Moreover Samsung will be counting on the Galaxy S5 Active units making up 20 – 30 percent of all the sales globally for the latest flagship. </p>
<p> Samsung has reported in the last month that the first quarter operating profit declined after a period of two years with the mobile business weakening. The Korean company also said that it has hopes that a strong second half of the year will have a solid growth in their mobile and tablet segments. It also said that it has planned to expand its flagship phone line and increase the number of phones that will work with the Galaxy Gear or other wearables. </p>
<p> The latest flagship is expected to be unveiled at the MWC that is going to be held at Barcelona scheduled later this month. So can we expect this S5 zoom to better the sales for Samsung? Can we expect the S5 mini too? Stay tuned for more updates and information. </p>

<p> After hearing about Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone, Galaxy S4 DUOS, Galaxy S4 Mini, the time is now for Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom which is not a smartphone but a Camera which is purported to come with the 10x Optical Zoom. If you can remember just in way back 2012, Samsung has launched Galaxy Camera and this Galaxy Camera Zoom will be a sequel to the former one.

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> 9 Reasons Why the Galaxy Tab 750 is the Best Tablet </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Tab 750, which is the 10.1-inch version of the tablet device by Samsung, is launched and is soon going to be in the market. But the craze as always for an Android tablet, is on its best. All of what the Galaxy Tab has, speaks for itself to be called the best Android tablet, and the best competitor which actually beats the Apple iPad. When something is hyped, people have their eyes wide open with expectations, and so here we have a list of the features that the Galaxy Tab 750 has, and which can help someone call the Tab as the best Tablet Device around – </p>
<p> Designed at its best, lightweight and the thinnest </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Tab 750 is a thin, sleek and a beautiful device which is made to be called the thinnest Tablet Device ever, beating the slimness of the iPad 2 by 0.2mm, and the weight too is lesser when compared to the iPad. The design makes it look beautiful with the white and black glossy and smooth surface. The other stuff that makes it look better is the limited number of physical keys or buttons, which are only for the lock/switch, and the volume jack keys. Everything else takes the advantage of the touch. The screen of 10.1 inch has a large resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels, and these heavy number of pixels make the display more vibrant and the picture quality becomes better, excelling the quality of video display compatible upto 1080p. </p>
<p> High-end processor for a Tablet Device </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab 750 is powered with the NVIDIA Tegra 2 Dual-Core processor, which would make the performance of the tab a lot better and every stuff would be performed in no time, especially the multitasking in the Android operating system. The speed is maintained, and along with that the high quality graphics and content on the tab is displayed without any glitches, making the Galaxy tab one of the best and fastest running tablet devices. </p>
<p> The Android Honeycomb Operating System </p>
<p> Honeycomb is the OS made only for the tablet devices that are running the Android OS, and the operating system is so beautifully developed to mingle along with the TouchWiz interface, and bring out the best for a good user experience. The multitasking, multiple home screens and the widgets, loads of applications that come pre-installed, and the famous Android Market which helps you download and install the applications anytime. The OS has a lot of connectivity options, and also support for multiple audio and video formats. </p>
<p> Battery life – Long enough equalling the iPad </p>
<p> Long ago when the Galaxy Tab gen 1 users used to complaint about the poor battery life of the tab, it was probably due to the Android OS and the interface, but the new Android OS i.e. the Honeycomb version has been optimized to provide the battery life of nearly 9 hours, with continuous usage. We don’t have the product in our hands, but still when a nearly comparable device the Motorola Xoom with the Android Honeycomb is providing around 10 hours of battery life, we can assume the Tab to be somewhere around the same. There you go iPad, enough of boasting about the battery life of yours. </p>
<p> Interface Customization & Apps </p>
<p> The interface is simple and easy to understand, but for those who want something better, they have that too. Vast customization options, and the availability of widgets would make the appearance more lively. The Galaxy Tab 750 has a plethora of options and services by Google, which include the Gmail, Google Talk video chat, Google Calendar, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Latitude, Google Places, Google Maps Navigation, Google Body and more services which you can install and use, most of which are free which come under the name of Google. With so many apps, one can make the device more productive, rather than using it just for entertainment. TouchWiz helps in making the home screens far better with the live widgets of social networks, weather, news, stock etc. </p>
<p> The famous Social Hub of Galaxy family </p>
<p> Almost all the devices of Samsung tagged with the name Galaxy have the Social Hub in them. It is quite helpful for people who are into social networking as you keep yourself updated with the updates from Social networks including Facebook and Twitter, and you won’t need to login to those networks using the web browser in the tab. The Social Hub even integrates itself quite well with the contacts of your phone, so that the contacts’ latest update appears on the screen when the call is being to or from the contact. </p>
<p> The Cameras do a lot of Magic </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab 750 has 2 cameras, the rear and front ones. The rear camera is of 3MP quality but is a pretty good one, enough capable to capture video at 720p quality. Hitting the iPad, the camera of the Galaxy Tab 750 has the LED flash which helps in capturing pictures in dark environment too. The front camera is of 2MP quality, a very nice one for the video conferencing with any other users who have the video calling option. The tab would take the help of the 3G connection or the Wi-Fi for the video conferencing. </p>
<p> Connectivity at its best </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Tab 750 has a lot of connectivity options, using which it helps you stay connected to the web all the time, and keep you updated with the real-time notifications and updates from the web and the social media. The tab supports the 3G connectivity, helping the device use the high-speed network connection, and the Wi-Fi b/g/n connectivity is also available. Contrary to the limited bluetooth service of iPad, the Galaxy Tab 750 has a high speed Bluetooth 3.0 technology, for the file sharing between the devices which have the bluetooth enabled. </p>
<p> Better Web Browser than before </p>
<p> The web browser of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 750 has a lot of improvements, loading the content in a better and faster way, and the default web browser even runs with the latest version of the Adobe Flash player so that any flash content can be opened within the browser, and there would be no hassle or additional requirements to open the flash content. The web browser supports multiple tabs and a lot more stuff which you can experience once you have the tab in your hands. </p>
<p> Of course every tablet device has its own unique selling points, but the Galaxy Tab has a few things which could keep it well ahead of any other tablet device in the market, starting from the design to many internal specifications. Porting a high-end processor and the memory options of 16GB, 32GB expansion through SD card slot, and a big advantage against the iPad being the flash content playing support, we can surely say that this device stands at its best and can rightly be called the best Tablet Device as of now. </p>
<p> Note: All the points mentioned above, were all a result of the original usage and hands-on experience of the Tab that we have with us, and so we agree that the tab has the best features that could very well go ahead of the other tablet devices like the iPad and the Motorola Xoom. </p>

<p> Seriously who writes these reviews?! At least get someone who has a good grasp of the English language to edit any spelling and grammar mistakes before posting them online!!! </p>
<p> Hi, Interesting article. I have Samsung Galaxy tab Gt-P7510 and in India it is known as 750 model. </p>
<p> I have wifi version. I am figuring out what are the accessories available in India for USB connection, additional memory and if can i use the USB port for the 3g connection. Plase advice. </p>
<p> So i’m unclear as to why but this particular weblog is reloading extremely sluggish in my opinion. Is anybody else experiencing this kind of difficulty or perhaps is it a difficulty on my pc? Let me verify it later on to check out that the problem continues to be found. </p>
<p> I’ve recently bought a samsung galaxy 750 tab… I cn reply and recieve text msgs bt not being able to make phone calls… Cud ny1 help me resolving this??? </p>
<p> Quite a comprehensive review. Samsung products are going to reign the gadgetsphere in 2012 as well. </p>
<p> Hands down, Apple’s app store wins by a mile. It’s a huge selection of all sorts of apps vs a rather sad selection of a handful for Zune. Microsoft has plans, especially in the realm of games, but I’m not sure I’d want to bet on the future if this aspect is important to you. The iPod is a much better choice in that case. </p>
<p> A very nice initiative and neat interface – of this page. </p>
<p> As for the Samsung Tab 10.1, its a real good tablet, the only probs being absence of phone calls and memory expandability. </p>
<p> I also faced the similar prob while connecting with kies. However, i did a factory reset and it seemed to go. Actually, I think, when we close some applications or empty the memory through the task manager, this problem comes…. </p>
<p> I have recently bought Samsung galaxy tab 10.1 gt-p7500. I am trying to sync this device with my windows xp PC thru latest version of kies 2.0 but my PC does not recognise this device and keeps on trying to connect. I desparately need your help in this regard and appreciate your advice. </p>
<p> We did find this problem when snycing and are coming up with a article on how to fix the same. </p>
<p> i was having a problem in viewing streaming videos in my galaxy tab 10.1 already update the adobe flash player..and yet still not working.. is this the issue from honeycomb OS? coz i’m having SGS2 and havent experience this kind of problem. appreciate your help with this.. TY in advance!!! </p>
<p> i was having a problem in viewing streaming videos in my galaxy tab 10.1 already update the adobe flash player.. still not working.. appreciate your help with this.. TY in advance!!! </p>
<p> The iPad also does not have a SD slot which is one of the biggest competitor to this tablet but well. </p>
<p> Who cares about iPad? iPad and iPad 2 are old stories! In the same Andriod platform, Motorola Xoom does have this option! And more over, we can make phone calls like in Samsung 7″ tab as well! This Samsung Tab 750 is no way in comparison with Motorola Xoom in many of the departments (Features, Performance etc) </p>
<p> To me Apple Products are the best. However, in future this might change, but other companies have a really long way to go. Yes, other companies are doing their best, but this only inspires Apple to excel more. So, the more the competition, the more better Apple becomes </p>
<p> Possibly true, but seems like Samsung is actually giving them a huge competition by bringing out a huge number of devices every month which are not just limited to mobiles but tablets, laptops and especially high-end smart televisions which are also outselling other manufacturers inspite of being priced higher. This clearly shows that even if Apple is the best, Samsung is trying to be a better company by offer good products. </p>
<p> Extremely disappointed that this site has fallen a prey to sponsors and turned into completely money minded lately. </p>
<p> How do you say that? Samsung never has paid us to write about their products. You could pretty well write here if any of the points are wrong and what do you disagree with? </p>
<p> First of all, hats off for allowing this post. The following were the reasons for my question. 1. This article always remain at the top of the list no matter even if new articles are added. 2. There are Galaxy Tab ads all over the site. 3. Read various comparisions and user reviews over the web and found iPad 2 is still the best. </p>
<p> I do love your site but lately, i find you are incorporating more tricks to make the user click on more pages. Example, you have added multiple page numbers for a single article. Well you may have your justifications, but i do feel that i am being used. Just let out my mind, sorry if it is wrong. </p>
<p> Well we can say we are more inspired from rediff.com which breaks a small article into 10 pages while we break only the firmware update articles which are very large ones into 4-5 parts maximum. The ads are served by third party providers which we cannot controlled and are mostly relevant to the content, which is obvious. </p>
<p> Regarding iPad 2 vs tab, it may be your personal choice and others choice and we are always here to suggest the best to our readers. If you feel we are biased, check out our Apple related blog at http://www.thewwwblog.com/ where we have a lot of information on iPad and its advantages / features. Thanks for commenting and giving our your fair points. </p>
<p> Amit, Android devices are rocking and I am sure Galaxy Tab will be a boon for Samsung and Android Lovers… 🙂 Someone is Special </p>
<p> However, the android devices return rate is quite high which is nearly 40% compare to Apple devices (just 2%). Android needs more improvements when it comes to long term usage. iPad or any apple devices just works like the same way from day 1 for several years. </p>
<p> Apple propoganda!! I’ve had the Galaxy tab P1000 from the day it was launched and it has never let me down. Only regret with it is that Samsung don’t appeare to be doing firmware updates to it. </p>

<p> Get Free 23GB Dropbox Storage on Android – Download Apk for Extra Space </p>
<p> Dropbox is a free cloud hosting services which simplifies the life by allowing users to get files cloud which can be accessed by any platformed based device like laptop, tablet and mobile phone. It makes accessing of important files easier and you never email a file again to your other electronic product that you have. Dropbox initially provides 2 GB of free storage for you for anyone who registers with them. Here comes a Dropbox hack by which you can get more space than you can get the maximum cap of 10 GB per user via referral. This time is whooping 23 GB up for grab and let me tell you that this is not a promotional offer or campaign by Dropbox. Let me make it clear that this is a third party application file and it involves installation of APK files on your Android device. This was released by theos0o on XDA Forums and we thank him for the efforts. </p>
<p> I was struggling with 2 GB storage which came free initially when any one signs up for Dropbox. Latter I found that by referring users you can add 250 MB for each successful referral and maximum was set to 10 GB via referral. Above that users have to pay yearly fee to get higher amount of storage. Follow the procedure below on how you can get additional 23 GB of free storage on your Dropbox – </p>
<p> First you need to uninstall the existing Dropbox app and to do that follow the path Settings > Applications > Manage applications > Dropbox and tap uninstall. </p>
<p> On the other side you need to download the APK file on your Android smartphone. To install this APK file you need to make sure that you have turned on the ‘Unknown Source’ under Settings > Application. </p>
<p> Now tap on the APK file and it will ask for the confirmation to install or not. Tap on Install. </p>
<p> You will further find that Dropbox will be installed on your phone. </p>
<p> Finally it will be installed. </p>
<p> When you tap on the Continue to Dropbox, you will be taken to further step of setting up your email with Dropbox. </p>
<p> Once you install the APK file and complete full installation of Dropbox APK file you will a mail at your registered email ID which says – </p>
<p> Hi Android Advices, </p>
<p> Congrats on becoming a Dropbox Guru! We’ve awarded you 23 GB of bonus space for the next 24 months! You now have 33.5 GB on Dropbox. To get even more space, check out our upgrade options. </p>
<p> Thanks again for supercharging your HTC device with Dropbox! </p>
<p> Here is the proof of 23 GB additional storage which I have got it on my account, previously it was hard earned 10 GB via referrals. </p>
<p> That’s it. That complete installation and you can now enjoy additional 32 GB of storage on your device. But this 23 GB free storage will last for at maximum of two years and once you complete two years, you will be asked to upgrade your account to premium. </p>

<p> I cant find any download link 🙁 can you send it to my email or upload it again? I’ll be very thankfull </p>
<p> THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I know its only for two years, but 23GB! </p>
<p> but im curious …….will dropbox team put a block to our account after 2 yrs? unless we upgrade to premium ? and will they take away all our stuff in that 23 gb? please let me knw 🙂 </p>
<p> Don’t try. It works for about a week, then the 23GB gets taken away. But, it was really nice for the week. </p>
<p> this works until drop box catches account. I had for 1 week then drop box took the space and all free space away. </p>
<p> I did what you said an in less than 5 minutes received the email telling me i received the 23GB…… hope it stays for the two years and not just a few days like some have been saying. </p>
<p> It still worked on Samsung Note! but didn’t mentioned about 2 years limitation… </p>
<p> You’ve earned 23 GB! </p>
<p> You can now store up to 30.25 GB of stuff in your Dropbox. Earn even more free space by inviting your friends to Dropbox! </p>
<p> Got 25gb of space. but after few days the space is revoked from me. any information about this. does anyone faces the same prob… </p>
<p> I got the additional storage as per e-mail. But after only about 2 weeks my storage reverted to 2 GB. Then i got the message that my files were to big for my storage. What happened? </p>
<p> Worked now btw. You can also use Bluestacks to get the additional space without even having an Android phone. Bluestacks is an “emulator” (or simulator…?) of android phones. </p>
<p> Hey! U use bluestacks and how did you made it look like it was Htc sense 4.0. Because i tried already signing in on android phone, got 23gb, and one day later, they took it away. </p>
<p> Worked like a charm 🙂 SE X10i – my account now has more than 33 GB of free space 🙂 </p>
<p> I downloaded the app and everything but it won’t let me log in with my account. It says wrong password or email although am 100% sure it is the right combination. </p>
<p> I’ve just got the 23GB of extra storage… but what happens if you don’t want to pay for an upgrade after 2 years – do they automatically ‘downgrade’ your account, or can you not access it unless you pay? </p>
<p> Thx but download still wont install. Nothing happens when u rap the install icon. </p>
<p> Its like your account is update and so that applies everywhere, whether you are using Dropbox on your PC, mobile or tablet. </p>
<p> Before installing anything, I changed my dropbox password to something trivial, in my case, i changed it to “nicetry”. </p>
<p> I then uninstalled the old dropbox, and installed this the modified dropbox. Waited for the email. Once it was confirmed that I got the extra storage. </p>
<p> I uninstalled. Changed my password to whatever it was previously. Installed dropbox from market/play/whatever. </p>
<p> Installed the App in a VBox Droid. Didnt receive the mail or the extra Storage. I hope it only takes time. </p>
<p> Yes it takes some time and then you should get a email about becoming a Dropbox Guru. </p>
<p> It still works, you need to clear app data before uninstalling and then proceed with the installation of this apk file and then login to your account. </p>
<p> … anybody can answer if this is legit or not? not about to hand over my password to a 3rd party quite yet </p>
<p> The app seems to be legit as its just modified. While thousands of users cannot be wrong. </p>

<p> How to Get Google Assistant on non-Pixel Android Phones – Guide </p>
<p> Google had made remarkable upgrades to the Nexus lineup earlier and introduced all new family in lieu with Pixel brand. So, for all those Android users who liked the concept of Google Assistant which is almost similar to that of Siri for iOS can now install this feature in non-Pixel phones as well. With Android Assistant, one can ask questions and then Google will help you out with the answers. Like if you search for the capital of Botswana or find translations in over 100 languages. Ask your Assistant for your flight status, and what the weather’s like when you get there. Let’s check out on how you can install Google Assistant on non-Pixel devices. </p>
<p> Guide to Install Google Assistant in non-Pixel Android Phones: </p>
<p> Download Google Assistant ZIP file ([arm] [arm64] [x86]) in your device and place the same in root folder </p>
<p> Reboot your device into the recovery mode </p>
<p> In recovery mode, select option of “install zip from sd card” to install Google Assistant in your device. </p>
<p> Once its installed, select “reboot system now” option with the help of volume down button to reboot the device. </p>
<p> Note: In case Google Assistant is not showing up, then wipe the app data of Google App. Also, Make sure that “Search assistant” or “Now on tap” is set as long-press action for home button. For One Plus 3 users, to start Google Assistant you need to hold the fingerprint scanner for 1sec. </p>

<p> Get up to $120 Off on Unlocked Moto G7 Play with Carrier activation </p>
<p> The mid-range Motorola G7 Play launched early this year didn’t make much impact on the market. Recently we have also seen the unlocked variant of the Moto G7 Play got 50 percent discount at Best Buy and now. The device was launched for $200 which was later slashed down to $180 but now, if the user is activating the device on Sprint, they can grab the handset for as low as $79.99. </p>

The user just needs an existing Sprint account or a new account has to be created. The other unlocked activations that you have are $129 on Verizon and AT&T while on Sprint it is $79.99. Well moving forward, the Moto G7 Plus comes with 6.2-inch IPS LCD 1080 x 2270 pixels display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection to save the device from minor falls and scratches. Under the hood, it comes with Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 chipset with eight cores and 1.8 GHz clocking speed coupled with Adreno 509 GPU and 4GB of RAM. </p>
<p> Talking about the camera department, the Moto G7 Play has a 16MP + 5MP camera setup on the rear along with a dual-LED dual-tone flash while on the front, there is a 12MP single selfie camera that can also record 2160p videos at 30 fps. Furthermore, the device is available in 64GB of onboard storage option which can be extended further up to 512GB via microSD card slot. The handset will be available in Viva Red and Deep Indigo color options. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Get Windows Phone 7 WP7 Look on Android Phones </p>
<p> The Zune like interface of the Windows Phone 7 phones has always gained a lot of fans due to its simplicity and the blending of the colors with the icons in the interface. Many a times even the Android users would like to have that interface on their Android phones. There are a few third party applications for the Android devices that would help in making the interface of the Android phones better, but still nothing could have made the phone look like the Windows Phone 7 device. The Launcher 7 App for Android does that. This app tries to replicate the Windows Phone 7 launcher into the high-end android devices, and all that comes in the Windows Phone 7 launcher, appears on the Android phone without any glitch. </p>
<p> Just like what you see on the Windows Phone, the home screen shows with large icons of Phone, Browser, Messages, Photos etc. and then the actual apps are listed on another screen that can be accessed by swiping the screen to the right, or pressing the right arrow just beside the large icons on the top. If you wish to have any application as a large shortcut on the main screen, you just need to long press the app and a new screen would appear with option to set the app icon on the main screen. You can customize the size to 1×1, 2×1 etc. and the Launcher 7 even has a set of icons that you use or else use the applications’ default icons. </p>
<p> The Launcher 7 even comes with the Live tiles, unlike the static ones. The live tiles such as the Calendar tile, People tile keep changing with time. The Calendar tile has the time and date that has to be changing always, and so here is where the imitation of the Windows Phone 7 is at it’s best. The People tile would display the pictures of the various contacts in your phone. The app even comes with options to add Widgets on the Launcher screen. You can add widgets like the battery percentage, weather forecast, just adjacent to the app icons. Adding a widget is pretty easy, by just pressing the Menu > Add Widgets and select the ones you want to place. The working and response of the widgets is just similar to the ones in the Android Launcher. </p>
<p> Launcher 7 is not just for people who want to try out the Windows Phone 7 launcher in their Android phones, but also for those who want to enhance their user experience and make the launcher in their phones look far better. It would surely remove the geeky and beautified colorful widgets that you see on a normal Android screen, but not everyone is a fan of it. The Launcher 7 is worth a try, and so there is a free version which has ads on the Applications page, and there is even a paid version without any ads. </p>
<p> I actually love this app. It’s such a clean and straight to the point interface and design. For me it’s been the fastest user experience so far. </p>
<p> I am actually working on a Windows Phone 7/ Metro UI framework for Android. My first public beta of my calculator app was released on the Android Market a few days ago. </p>
<p> OMG — WHY?! At less than two minutes from install to uninstall, Launcher 7 was the shortest-lived app ever on my HTC Desire. “What a fugly UI!”, I said, as I hit UNINSTALL. Never having seen WP7 I didn’t realize until later Launcher 7 was just implementing the metro interface. All I can say is what was Microsoft thinking?! </p>
<p> Welcome to the Windows Phone 7 Interface, thats one of the main reasons why Android sales are going up and WP7 are going down. </p>
<p> Reason for poor uptake of WP7.5 is restricted availability of handsets & also WP7.5 handset price starts from 15000INR. Android has a wider device portfolio & one can get an android phone for 4000INR. But if we see the sales chart of Nokia Lumia phones its Impressive, Nokia has sold 3.5million lumia phones for Q1 2012. Thats pretty impressive figures for an OS which is new & major markets like US, China are excluded. </p>
<p> Lumia 900 has managed to bag 4th rank in AT&T’s bestselling phones list & in many european countries its No 1 seller. Wp7.5 offers a refreshing experience & its a crash free OS. phone doesnt need frequent restarts nor it hangs. </p>

<p> Gigabyte S700 7″ Android Tablet Launched – Specs Feartures & Photos </p>
<p> Gigabyte, a Taiwan based company has few Android smartphone announced previously and their portfolio is not up to the mark. Gigabyte however at CeBIT 2012 held at Germany came up with announcement their upcoming Android tablet called Gigabyte 700 and maybe it will be re branded with other name in the market. Let us go through the specifications of Gigabyte S700 Android tablet which is starting to get a appearance at various events. </p>
<p> Gigabyte S700 Android Tablet </p>
<p> Gigabyte S700 is a 7 inches Android tablet coming out with capacitive touchscreen display supporting multi touch input method. The operating system included in this tablet is Android 2.3 Gingerbread OS and its comes with 3G modem integrated. With that you can use Gigabyte S700 as mobile phone for making calls, 3G calls and for video chat as well as it has front facing VGA camera. This tablet also gets a rear camera with unknown camera resolution provided to us from the source. </p>
<p> The tablet almost looks like the Kindle Fire tablet by Amazon in comparison. Gigabyte S700 has a SIM card slot on the right side edge with easy swap and remove. Just beside the SIM card slot there is a micro SD card slot which is provided to expand the storage capacity attached with this tablet to a maximum of 32 GB using the micro SD card slot. </p>
<p> The rear side camera is seen on the left edge top corner, which is something which we haven’t seen in any tablet till now. The micro USB connectivity for PC transfer and charging is located at the bottom edge and the power button is locked at the top edge. The tablet gets internet access via Wi Fi if you have or you can make use of 3G to browse the web. </p>
<p> As of now we know that Gigabyte S700 Android tablet will be with following specifications – </p>
<p> Android 2.3 Gingerbread OS </p>
<p> Wi Fi </p>
<p> 3G HSDPA </p>
<p> Gigabyte S700 was just showcased at CeBIT 2012 event thus it doesn’t have any availability information and no pricing details too were made available. Just as the Eric Schimdt, the Google Chairman tipped that future of Android tablets would be better for cheap tablets, so we might think that Gigabyte will review the price of S700 so that its well in accordance and the minus point of this tablet is the Android version included which clearly means that it is low on processor speed. Do check out other cheaper tablets like Sruta priced at $ 200 , a 7 inches Android tablet and Viota M970 9.7 inches tablet priced at $ 120, both coming out with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. </p>

<p> Gionee Elife E7 Camera Samples – Natural & Low Light, Indoors, HQ Photos </p>
<p> The Gionee Elife E7 has one of the best cameras for a smartphone, and the 16-megapixel shooter does a quite decent job in capturing the photos in bright conditions, and it really doesn’t disappoint when capturing in the low light conditions. When compared to the Android smartphone camera apps, the Nokia ones with the Windows Phone interfaces were always applauded, but the Gionee Elife E7 is coming with an excellent interface for the camera app, and there are a lot of settings to play around with, to take the advantage of the beautiful 16MP lens. </p>
<p> Camera resolution: 16-megapixel </p>
<p> LED Flash </p>
<p> Photo resolution: 4608 x 3456 pixels </p>
<p> The above and below screenshots would show you how good the interface of the camera app is. You won’t be able to see those effects which are included in most of the high-end devices, but the manual controls are excellent. You can change the ISO, IV, White Balance and size to various levels, and the rotatory options would be for the modes – Normal, touch, V-sign, Smile and the Self-time options for 2 seconds, 5 seconds or 10 seconds. </p>
<p> The actual capturing options are also quite good, and the HDR mode is excellent. There are capture modes such as Auto, Sport, Night, Panorama and HDR. The user can choose to turn Face detection on, and there is a level meter to make you understand if the phone is actually titled or is straight when taking a photo. </p>
<p> Now, here are a few sample captures we did at our studio to check out the capture quality in different conditions. The first one below is a natural shot where the object is near, and how beautifully everything in the background is defocused. </p>
<p> The same object at same distance, with the background being too bright, to understand how it captures and whether the background defocus is the same with this too. </p>
<p> Captures with Flash turned on – When the LED flash is turned on, the flash throws itself very bright, but it’s not spreading well. We are not impressed with the flash, making the capture more unnatural than we expected it to be. </p>
<p> HDR Mode – This was brilliant, as expected. The light was reduced automatically and there is very less noise on the object although you might have to wait for 2-3 seconds for the HDR shoot to be captured. </p>
<p> Low-light capture / Night mode – The low light photography is what many a times we are concerned about, for any smartphone camera. The Elife E7 does the same job as any other would do on the normal mode, but the Night mode was quite good as the noise was reduced and the detailing was brighter and better. </p>
<p> Below are a couple other natural shots captured with the Elife E7 camera, under the normal light conditions. </p>
<p> Overall, we were quite impressed with the Gionee Elife E7’s camera in different conditions, and the manual options makes it even better for the users who know how the settings would work, and when they didn’t really want to carry a digital camera along while traveling. </p>
<p> 3 Comments </p>
<p> Can u compare its camera with other flagship models like Z1,S4,etc. or can you say is it better than them or equal to them.. </p>
<p> WOW! the only word needed for the camera samples 🙂 this phone is amazing but I don’t know why Gionee is not doing good marketing of this awesome beast. </p>

<p> Gionee Elife E7 Mini vs Motorola Moto G Android Phone Comparison </p>
<p> The Gionee Elife E7 Mini was just launched in the Indian market, while the Moto G from Motorola is available in the US market, and should hit the other stores in the coming months. Let us review which one is better to get your hands on. Both the handsets are set for a release in India in January next year, so let us see the specifications of both the handsets and compare them. </p>
<p> Display Comparisons </p>
<p> The Gionee Elife E7 Mini is flaunting a 4.7 inch HD (720 x 1280 pixels) IPS capacitive touch screen display which is slightly bigger than the Moto G’s display which is a 4.5 inch TFT HD (1280 x 720 pixels) capacitive touch screen. So there is nothing much in difference between both the devices except for Elife E7 Mini being 2 inch bigger than Moto G. </p>
<p> Processor and Memory Comparisons </p>
<p> The Gionee Elife E7 Mini that was launched earlier, is powered by a 1.7 GHz Octa-core MEdiaTek MT6592 processor coming into market to compete with Smart Phones like Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Zopo ZP998, Intex i17 and Micromax Canvas 5, which also have Octa-core processors. The Moto G is powered with a Quad-core 1.2 Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor coupled with a 1 GB RAM as it is seen in the Gionee Elife E7 Mini. Clearly we can say that the Gionee Elife E7 Mini is having an upper hand in terms of the processor. </p>
<p> The storage of Moto G varies as there are two variants with 8 GB and 16 GB variants which do not have a micro SD card slot and the Elife E7 Mini has only one variant of 16 GB internal storage that can be extended via microSD card. </p>
<p> Camera Comparison </p>
<p> After the Oppo N1, the Gionee Elife E7 mini is the only Smart Phone having a swivel (rotating) 13 MP camera which can record videos at 1080p. There is only on camera on this handset that can be used as both front and rear camera. It is also an autofocus camera with LED flash. The Moto G has a 5 MP camera with LED flash and a 1.3 MP front facing camera. </p>
<p> Even here the Gionee Elife E7 Mini’s, 13 MP camera is ahead with Moto G’s camera. Giving us better pictures with the only camera it has, making it as a 13 MP front camera too. </p>
<p> Operating System </p>
<p> The Gionee Elife E7 Mini is running on Android 4.2 with Amigo User Interface (UI) on top, where as the Moto G is coming out with Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) with a guaranteed upgrade. </p>
<p> Battery Comparison </p>
<p> The Elife E7 Mini is packing a built in battery of 2100 mAh, which is non removable and the Moto G is powered with 2070 mAh battery. There no significant difference between both. </p>
<p> Price Comparison </p>
<p> The Gionee Elife E7 Mini will be shipping in to India with a price tag of 18,999, where as it is $179 (INR 11,000) for 8 GB and $199 (INR 12000) for 16 GB variants which is rather cheaper. As for now Moto G is selling outside India and expected to be released in the month of January, but we are not sure of the pricing yet. </p>
<p> Connectivity Comparison </p>
<p> The connectivity options again don’t differ much, but the actual major difference which one would really keep in mind is the Dual-SIM feature in the Elife E7 Mini which could be handy for many, while the Moto G users have an option to place just one Micro SIM. </p>
<p> The Moto G’s back cover is removable and can be replaced by blue, teal, red, yellow, purple, white and black colors, giving the users more options. </p>
<p> So these are some of the comparisons between the two handsets Gionee Elife E7 Mini and Moto G. since both are set for a release in India, which one would you prefer, the more colorful and cheaper Moto G or Gionee Elife E7 Mini with better specifications?

<p> Gmail App for Android Updated – Larger Photo Attachments, Gallery View, Swipe to Delete </p>
<p> Gmail has been one consistent and best Mail client, and one of the best apps from Google for the Android phones. It includes the easiest ways to interact with people via emails, and the app has kept getting better, with the latest update having some neat improvements which enhance the way a user experiences it and takes advantage of these improvements. </p>
<p> The latest update in the Gmail App for both Android and iOS operating systems includes some enhancements especially in the attachments of the mail – Pictures, Videos and the previews of the same. Apart from this, the Gmail update brings along the option to swipe the message to the right or left to either delete the mail conversation or to archive it. The changes from the previous version are dependent on the Android version that your phone has got. There are a few changes in the Gmail app for Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and later versions, while the changes are different for the devices which have Android 2.2 Froyo and later versions till Gingerbread. </p>
<p> Here are the changes that you would notice in the updated Gmail app: </p>
<p> Attach Photos and Videos from within the Gmail App </p>
<p> Earlier it was a single option for attaching a file in the Gmail app, but now the updated version of the Gmail has got the special options of attaching images and videos while you are typing a new email using the app. </p>
<p> Attached Pictures in Larger View and Gallery </p>
<p> The pictures that you receive through the mail, now are arranged well and have larger thumbnails, while earlier it was the smaller thumbnails. The images now can be previewed together just like a Gallery, while earlier you would have to preview each image separately. </p>
<p> Swipe for Deleting and Archiving </p>
<p> Swiping was earlier of no use, but now the updated Gmail has an option of deleting and archiving the mails. Swipe a mail conversation to the right to delete it, while swiping to the left would archive the mail. </p>
<p> The update brings all of these changes for the two versions of Android: </p>
<p> Updates for the Android 4.0 and Later OS: </p>
<p> Auto fits the message to the screen, and message can be zoomed </p>
<p> Swipe the mail to archive or delete </p>
<p> Option to attach pictures and videos directly from the Gmail app </p>
<p> Photo previews for attachments, and larger thumbnails in mail </p>
<p> Bug fixes and performance improvements </p>
<p> Updates for the Android 2.2 and up: </p>
<p> New Labels API for 3rd-party app developers </p>
<p> Performance improvements </p>
<p> The updated Gmail would come as an update on your Android phone in the Play Store automatically, or else you would have to search for the update manually as most of the times would have set the option of updating the apps only when Wi-Fi is turned on. You can manually search for the update by going to the My Apps section in the Play Store, and there you would see the update available for the Gmail app. </p>

<p> Google Android Q Beta 4 Update Released for Pixel Smartphones </p>
<p> Last month in California, we have witnessed Google I/0 2019 where the tech giant released Android Q Beta 3 update. Now, Google has released the latest Android Q Beta 4 update for Pixel Smartphones that includes the recently launched Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL as well. Few hours boo, we have seen Google releasing its June 2019 security Patch for Pixel phones and now they are getting the latest Android Q Beta 4. Furthermore, the Essential Phone will also be getting the latest version for the compatible handsets to the days to come. </p>
<p> Google has scheduled to release two more beta updates before the official final update of Android Q is released in the third quarter. Without out any doubt, the upcoming Pixel 4 along with the Pixel 4 XL will be first to come out of the box with Android Q final update along with the official SDK. The developers cannot submit their apps targeting the latest version of Android API 29 to the PlayStore. Although the update does not bring new features, it confirms few new features to be in the final version which could be available in the next update. </p>
<p> The users who are already on the Android Q Beta 3 update will be getting an OTA update. Furthermore, there are few reports from the users about the failure in the installation of the latest Android Q Beta build and also the devices are getting stuck while rebooting. Few other reports claim that the device is getting booted directly into the recovery mode with a failed update error which shoes up on to the screen but this boot loop issue is limited to very few users as of now. </p>
<p> There is also a way to manually update the Android Q for the first time users for the latest Android Q Beta 3 update. The applications that are targeting Android Q will be supporting the Dark Theme, Suggested Replies, Gesture Navigation and more. Google already announced that the latest Android built will be supporting the foldable devices also, considering there are many foldable devices to come into the market.

<p> Google Camera for Android Brings Excellent Features, including Lens Blur – Download Now </p>
<p> Did you always wanted to have a SLR camera because your Android Smart phone or Tablet does not give you that depth in your photos or won’t give you the option of focusing the foreground and blur the background. These features were only possible with cameras with bigger lens and aperture but now you can do all these with you Smart phone. Yea you heard it right! Google has come out with its Lens Blur in its new Camera app. </p>
<p> With this Lens Blur app you now make any object come in to focus just by tapping on it and changing the depth-of field slider you can adjust the aperture size to get the bokeh effects from subtle to surreal. This change takes place in real time allowing you to see the changes instantly on to the image. The changes or the effects can be given to the image once it’s been captured and the level of focus can be adjusted. </p>
<p> How does the Lens Blur work? </p>
<p> Many of you might wondering how this app will be working or how can a camera with small lens and aperture can do this, Lens Blur just replaces the need for the larger optical system by algorithms that will be stimulating a larger lens and aperture and by this you will be able to capture many frames just by a upward sweep of the camera instead of taking just one image. Later from these photos the app uses the computer vision algorithms that will be creating a 3D model of the image by estimating the depth to every point in the back ground. </p>
<p> After we get the 3D pose of images, the depth of each pixel is computed in the reference photo by using the MVS (Multi-View Stereo) algorithm. Now MVS works similar to the human stereo vision like giving the location of one object in two different images. By triangulating the 3D position of this object in the image the distance is computed. Later MVS measures the pixels from both the images and calculates how similar they are by computing the Sum of Absolute differences (SAD) of the RGB colors of the two pixels. To encounter the optimization problem this app uses the Markov Random Field inference (MRF) method. </p>
<p> After all these things are done the re-rendering of the image starts and the blurring of the pixels will take place depending on the depth of the pixel, aperture and the location that is relative to the focal plane that determines which pixel to blur. The amount of blur increases proportionally with the distance of each pixel to that focal plane. </p>
<p> All these algorithms run on mobiles and create this 3D photo that is very much related to the computers vision algorithm that is used in the 3D mapping features of Google like the Google Maps and Google Earth. Now enjoy the SLR like images on you Android Smart phone or Tablet with this updated Google app. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Google ChromeCast Hands-on FAQ & User Guide Tips & Tricks </p>
<p> Google ChromeCast can be put for some good use, especially when there’s a need for streaming the content to a larger HD television which can connect to the Wi-Fi network, with the smart features. We’ve shared how you can setup Chromecast to stream the content, but the doubts don’t end there because being a totally new, many don’t even know what could be done to take the full advantage of the Chromecast device. </p>
<p> Read below for all the different Frequently asked questions about the Chromecast dongle, and the different tips one has to follow to get the right use of the dongle. </p>
<p> What can Chromecast do? </p>
<p> The main purpose of the Chromecast is to stream the content. Now, to be precise on what content can be sent across, here’s it – Netflix, Google Music, Google Play movies or YouTube. The content can be streamed even from the HDD through the Chrome browser on the laptop. </p>
<p> My Netflix doesn’t work with Chromecast, Why? </p>
<p> The only reason we found why the Chromecast didn’t work with the Netflix app is the version of the app. We initially were not prompted about it, but later found a notice that the Netflix app has to be updated through the Play Store to make the Chromecast run. </p>
<p> How to Setup my Chromecast? </p>
<p> To setup, we have shared a screenshot guide to make it easier for you to understand, but when you are trying to access it through your Google Chrome browser, there is a specific URL you need to go to set things up. </p>
<p> Youtube gives any restrictions to play through Chromecast? </p>
<p> It’s probably because Chromecast and Youtube being both from Google, the company did work quite well to run everything without an issue. There are restrictions for a few Blu players and the Xbox, Playstation devices but with Chromecast, there is no issue at all and you can play all kinds of content from Youtube to the larger screen devices like the HDTV. </p>
<p> Is Chromecast streaming similar on the Apple iOS / Mac as on Android? </p>
<p> Yes it’s almost the same, because all in all it’s the similar app you get for the iOS devices through the iTunes store, and the Mac would need you to use the Google Chrome browser which is well available. </p>
<p> Is Chromecast a perfect replacement for all the other Streaming devices? </p>
<p> We would be too early to judge this, because Chromecast is still not totally huge, and devices such as Roku or the PS3 or XBox have got some extra compatibility and options to run content from other sources, but Chromecast has a limited functionality right now. In the coming future, it should be able to support the other browsers too like the PS3 which has got support to the Amazon Prime and other browsers. </p>
<p> Does the TV really need Wi-Fi to get the content from ChromeCast? </p>
<p> There for two ways for this. If at all your TV has got the Wi-Fi, which is a feature in the smart TVs, you can take advantage of it, but if there’s no WiFi then you can stream the content using the HDMI port because the actual device which needs the Wi-Fi here is the ChromeCast which is the receiver from the smartphone on the same network. </p>
<p> Only video content can be streamed from Google Chrome browser? </p>
<p> Use the Google Cast chrome extension and there would be no limitation on the content you are sharing through the browser, even the normal web pages can be streamed and shared. </p>
<p> Is a smartphone or tablet device necessary to run the ChromeCast? </p>
<p> Not at all. As said above, the Google chrome from your laptop, i.e. either Windows or Mac OS would be able to run and stream the content to the ChromeCast device, thus there’s no need for an Android / iOS smartphone or tablet to run it. </p>
<p> Would the data from my phone be used if I am streaming to ChromeCast? </p>
<p> The mobile device would basically act as a remote control, thus it would work only on the same WiFi network and thus if you are trying to view content through your mobile data network connection, that won’t be possible, and thus your network data won’t be eaten by ChromeCast. </p>
<p> Changing the TV volume is possible through ChromeCast using my phone? </p>
<p> It is to some extent, where the phone’s volume can make changes to the actual volume of the TV, and if your TVs volume is set to low earlier, then you might have to use the actual TV remote to make the volume higher than what it has been set to. </p>
<p> What’s the best resolution I can stream through ChromeCast? </p>
<p> Although we are expecting a higher resolution streaming later on, the current best streaming resolution from Google ChromeCast is 720p, which still is pretty good and to have this too continuous you need to ensure that you have a good internet connection which can provide lag-free streaming of the video content. </p>
<p> Is it possible to stream not just the tab but entire screen of my computer? </p>
<p> The one that we tested was a beta feature and still into testing, but yes there would be a possibility for you to stream the entire screen of your computer, i.e. desktop using the ChromeCast and the Google Cast extension for the Chrome browser. In short, Google is working well on making a lot of possibilities by combining ChromeCast and Google Chrome. </p>
<p> Where does the ChromeCast keep itself ahead of Roku? </p>
<p> Roku although has got some extra and better features than ChromeCast, we don’t expect anything much in the future but ChromeCast is expected to provide a lot more. First advantage of this dongle over Roku is the small size, which makes it easier to carry, and the other one is the pricing where the Roku costs around $75, but the ChromeCast is priced at $35 in the US market. </p>
<p> Will the support for ChromeCast extend from other Video streaming sites? </p>
<p> As of what we read on USA Today news piece, the following video streaming sites have shown an interest in providing support for the dongle – Pandora, HBO GO, Redbox, Hulu, Vevo, Vimeo, Songza, TWit.TV, and Plex. So we might be seeing a lot in the coming future. </p>
<p> Do comment below if you have any other questions about the ChromeCast, it’s functionality and if you wanted any help regarding the installation and usage of it. </p>

<p> When trying to cast Pandora music through my Chromecast to my TV, the audio is jumpy, slowed down or otherwise stopping. Any suggestions? </p>
<p> While I get netflix streaming on my iphone with volume when I switch to tv set there is no volume, even when I put tv volume on high. does box need to be set to aux or tv or what can be the problem. Better yet, what might be the solution? </p>
<p> I am considering turning off my cable completely and using netflix and/or hulu plus. However, some shows are only available on the networks website, with Chromecast can I log into that website and watch the show on my TV? </p>
<p> With smartphone/tablet available today, generally provision is available to connect micro HDMI to HDMI cable e.g Nexus 10, Galaxy Note etc . Hence, it is possible to start streaming video on smartphone/ tablet and transer signal to HD TV by cable. As I understand, with such type of Googlecast device, signal is transferred by wi-fi and cable connection is not required. Am I right in understanding? </p>
<p> When trying to install the Google Cast extension on my smartphone/galaxy tablet, I get a message saying it is not available for this version. I can install it fine in my laptop/desktop Chrome browser. </p>

<p> For accessing your PC or Mac from your Android device, you need to download a companion server application for the Mac or PC alongside the Chrome Web Store applications. After installing these applications you can have the access to the computer and you can see the desktop where you can have all the access on the files and folders from a distance. </p>
<p> This type of application from Google was seen earlier this year also where an Android client was made available in source form. About the app, there are no tutorials given how we can operate and control the mouse but we can always head to the help menu for all other details. The controls are a bit tricky, if you want a left click just tap once but if you are trying the right clicks then you have to give a two finger tap on to it. </p>
<p> There are not many features bundled with this chrome Remote Desktop app as many other apps have various features like the file push, function buttons or media controls. To control you desktop or PC you need to zoom in to clearly see all the options and you can also zoom out if you wish too. However this app is a pretty good one considering it is official from Google and is available for free on the Google play store. So did you download this app? Will this app help you?

<p> Google Docs on Android </p>
<p> There is no stand alone app pre-built into the Android operating system that allows you to directly edit Google Docs. Sure, you can jump into your browser and just edit it via your browser – however this uses up your data allowance. I am specifically referring to a method to edit your Google Docs offline. That is where GDocs steps into the fray. GDocs allows you to download, edit and upload Google Docs from your phone – yes, I know, I did say offline; it does allow you to edit the documents offline! It also allows you to view PDF files. Although it is not officially a Google app as such, it seems legit and I have used it myself so I can attest to the fact that it works and all my data wasn’t compromised when I used it. Once all of your Google Docs are downloaded you can edit them one by one in an offline manner instead of relying on being online on the Google Docs website. </p>
<p> It probably isn’t the best solution for those of us who want a fully integrated cloud driven solution to altering our Google Docs while mobile – however, it works. The best solution is generally one that works and even though this one might seem a little sloppy it does add an extra element of functionality to your phone. It also doesn’t mess around in regards to eye candy and a flashy interface. The app is purely functional and is pretty easy to get your head around. You will need to insert your Google account details into the app to get the most out of it. If you can’t trust it then just use it as an editor. Just makes sure your documents are accessible without having to log into your Google account – and even if they aren’t you can just download them via a browser then open them up with GDocs. </p>
<p> You can add documents via the intuitive interface pretty easily. If you just want to use GDocs to sync Google Documents to your Android device then this works as well. If you have a preferred word processing app, download the document after syncing to your SD card from there you can mess around with the document and resync it using GDocs. It is a pretty flexible solution so it is not all bad. It doesn’t only allow you to upload and download word processing documents, spreadsheets and graphs – because Google Docs now has support for any file type you can use GDocs to sync any file on your phone to your Google Docs account. </p>
<p> So GDocs certainly has its place. Even if you are not using it as an editor – it is a great little app to pull your Google Docs off the Google Docs server for editing elsewhere. You can use it via WiFi as well so you don’t need to be directly connected to the internet with your phone to access them (as long as you have set your phone up to poach internet through a WiFi connection). It is just a nice way to get all of your Google Docs in a single place other than Google Docs itself. </p>

<p> Google Earth on Android Devices </p>
<p> Google Earth is a pretty heavy program so it has taken a little time to get it optimised for the Android market – but it is now here and runs beautifully. In fact, it runs as well as it runs on my computer to a great extent. Of course when loading large masses of data you can see pretty dramatic decrease in phone performance if you are running it on a phone versus a computer – but all in all it is usable and quite responsive. It also has support for a lot of little things that are built into the Android platform such as voice commands. For example, you can tell the app (with your voice) to visit Sydney and it will zoom straight there and bring it up in all of its glory. I was a little worried about the performance when used on a phone – however it is only available for Android 2.1 and better so older Android devices which may not be as powerful will not run it. </p>
<p> For those of us that like to play around with Google Earth at home, we can now do it on the move (however, the Google Earth iPhone app has been around for a while now – I am specifically talking about Android users). It is currently only available (officially) for Nexus One, iPhone and Droid – although I’d give it a go if you have any Android device that runs Android 2.1 or better, there is a good chance it will work. However, those of us who have a different Android phone will need to find a work around to get it working possibly (I may be wrong). Google Earth for Android offers pretty much the exact same functionality as the desktop version. It has full 3D capability, search functions specifically aimed at finding localities, layers and multi-touch support. </p>
<p> It will be interesting to see what extra functionality will be built into the Google Earth app as it starts taking advantage of some of the features that are part of the Android core software. I mean we already have multi-touch support but it would be nice to see something like the ability to tilt our phones in order to enable the map to jump out a little. As it stands it is free to install on your phone so not many complaints should be forthcoming in regards to having it available for mobile users. </p>
<p> Currently, voice support (for the Android version) is available for English, Mandarin and Japanese. I wasn’t able to find any information on what language is likely to be next – however the software already has support for non-voice activated commands in a variety of language. If I were to take a guess I would probably say that Spanish, French or German is likely to be next in regards to voice support – however, it is a Google app so who knows. Maybe all three will be supported with a few other more obscure languages that none of us have heard of. You can always try using a translator to translate the voice commands if you really need voice activation. </p>

<p> Google & Huawei to pay up to $400 to the owners of Faulty Nexus 6P </p>
<p> Google along with Huawei has agreed to pay $400 to the owners of the Nexus 6P smartphone who have participated in the on-going lawsuit. Users have experienced a boot looping issue which caused the device to shut down suddenly even after having enough battery. Both the companies would be liable to a $9.75 million settlement for the class action which began in April 2017 and ends up in payments of up to $400. </p>
<p> The lawsuit states that Google has contracted the design and manufacturing of its Android smartphone to the third-party companies that include Huawei has breached the warranty even after the company was aware of it and has not come up with a fix. Once the Court approves the settlement, the owners of Nexus 6P who purchased the device on or after 25th of September 2015 in the US will be eligible to claim the reimbursement. </p>
<p> According to the settlement proposal made, those who are eligible for the settlement will receive up to $400 and the next hearing on the same is scheduled on May 9th. Furthermore, those who have received a Pixel XL smartphone in the warranty exchange program will be getting $10 in reimbursement. For this, the owners of these devices have to provide proper documentation of the bug and they will be eligible to receive the settlement money. </p>
<p> Who do not provide the proper documentation for the same could be eligible for up to $75. These numbers are not final yet since the settlement has not been concluded yet. For submitting the claim you need to check the source link which we have provided. As we know the Nexus series has been completely replaced by the Pixel series now and Google is no more working on Pixel devices. Do you own a faulty Nexus 6P which was launched in 2015? Are you a part of the on-going lawsuit? Comment in the section below if you have more queries on the same and stay tuned to Android Advices for more. </p>

<p> Google Integrates Apps, Movies, eBooks & Music into One – Google PLAY </p>
<p> Google Inc. surprises by unifying its digital entertainment offerings with a single Cloud based solution called as “Google Play”. So from today all the Google offerings from Google like Android Market Place, eBook Store and Google Music will be all under one common emporium umbrella named as “Google Play”. As of now this service is not yet rolled out Worldwide but it’s soon gonna be launched Worldwide very soon. With an all new Logo and a refreshed brushed Look, Google Play looks promising initially by converging different entertainment sections into one called “Play”. For more, you can also refer to the Video below. </p>
<p> With the launch of Google PLAY, you can now purchase applications for as low as 25 cents. As soon as you open the Google PLAY or Android Market Place, you will be able to find the information about the same. We have shown a screen capture on how the new look of Google PLAY looks like. According to the Google, there will be following mentioned content available as of now in the form of Google Play but will soon be extended to other parts of World too. </p>
<p> eBooks: Available in US, UK, Canada, and Australia </p>
<p> Music: Available in US </p>
<p> To start off, Google PLAY will come along with the goodness of 20, 000 music tracks storage capability or also you can purchase new songs from a catalog of over 8 million songs.

The list doesn’t stop here, you can also rent from thousands of movies. When asked about the need of all this, Google’s Rosenberg said that they want to make everything very simple and they wanted to empower the Google users so that all can be done with just a sign on with Google account and also added that there’s many more such initiatives to come. </p>

<p> Google Nexus 5 Camera Samples – Outdoor, Low-light & Macro Captures </p>
<p> The Google Nexus 5, a very neat device which was made again by LG came in with some excellent specifications, but the camera did not come with real good improvements. It’s still the same 8-megapixel shooter on the rear side but there is Optical Image Stabilization, which does a neat job of capturing especially when you have a little shaky hands and want the camera to do the job of making the photo stable. </p>
<p> Specs of the camera: </p>
<p> 8-megapixel </p>
<p> 1/3.2-inch sensor </p>
<p> f/2.5 lens </p>
<p> We did a few tests of the camera with the outdoor, indoor, background defocusing and the macro type of captures, but there are no different loads of capturing modes and effects that we see in several other smartphone cameras. There are just a few but you should be a fine enough for the normal capturing. The picture sizes that are possible for capturing include – 8MP, 5MP, 3MP, 2MP, 1.3MP, 1MP, VGA and QVGA. </p>
<p> Apart from this, we get to see exposure options, white balance options including Incandescent, Fluorescent, Day Light, Cloudy and Auto. The scene modes include Action, Night, Party, Sunset, Party and None. The Panorama Capture can be done as the normal wide panorama or the Photosphere where the 360-degree capturing is possible to try out something new, and this was something available in the LG G2 too. </p>
<p> HDR+ capture is excellent, and it takes a few shots at the same time and then merge them to make one. It won’t work when you are partying and trying to take a few clicks in quick succession, as the HDR+ would need at least a couple seconds before the photo you captured is processed. But for a single photo, the quality for sure is a lot better than the normal capture. </p>
<p> [fsg_gallery id=”5″] </p>
<p> We would soon be doing a test of the video recording (1080p) and add it here. The front camera does nothing exceptional except for the normal capturing and video chatting.

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Google Nexus 5 – First Impressions on Software and Hardware </p>
<p> I received my Nexus 5 today and here are some quick first impressions. </p>
<p> First a quick recap of the specifications of the latest Nexus flagship phone made by LG for Google: </p>
<p> 4.95-inch 1080p Full HD display (445 ppi) </p>
<p> Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor clocked at 2.3 GHz </p>
<p> 2GB of RAM </p>
<p> 8-megapixel rear camera with the LED flash and Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) </p>
<p> OS: Android 4.4 KitKat OS, Google’s latest flavor of Android </p>
<p> Hardware: </p>
<p> The first thing you notice when you pick up the Nexus 5 is its size, or should I say lack of it. For a 5″ phone, it feels incredibly comfortable to hold. The slight curves along the back edges along with the soft touch back, similar to the Nexus 7, serve to make the phone very ergonomic. You can reach all four edges of the phone without having to move it around too much in your hand. </p>
<p> The phone is extremely fast and the processor can handle everything you throw at it. I didn’t see any lag whatsover when opening apps, switching between apps or scrolling in the web browser. The Nexus 5 handled everything with ease. In normal use, the Nexus 5 seems to be both faster and smoother than the Nexus 4 and the Samsung Galaxy S3 that I was able to compare it to. </p>
<p> The 5″ 1080p screen@ 445 ppi is extremely crisp and bright and makes for a amazing viewing experience. You can’t make out any individual pixels on the screen even if you looked for it closely. Overall, it is among the top screens currently on a smart phone. HD videos on Netflix and Youtube look great. This phone could easily replace your tablet as a video player on your plane rides. Overall I am really impressed with the screen on this device. </p>
<p> The one thing that has disappointed me so far is the speaker on this phone. It is among the softest speakers I’ve ever encountered on a smartphone. Even at full volume, the sound is less than half as loud as on an iPhone 5 I compared it against. When you are outdoors or driving in a car, I would expect not to hear much at all through the speaker. Hopefully this is something Google can fix with a software update in the future. </p>
<p> The Nexus 5′s predecessor, the Nexus 4, was widely criticized for its middling camera performance. In the limited time I had with the Nexus 5, it seemed to take decent pictures, both indoors and outdoors. The OIS system certainly helps in low light conditions to compensate for hand shake. However the camera app overall seems to be on the slow side. It take a second or two to open and when you take pictures, sometimes the auto focus is slow to get a lock. This could result in people missing out on important moments if they are trying to take action shots of a fast moving object, pet or a kid. There is also no burst mode in the camera, which is suprising for a high end phone in 2013. Again, hopefully Google can improve the camera performance with future software updates. </p>
<p> Software: </p>
<p> The phone runs on Android 4.4 KitKat as expected. With KitKat, Google has gone with a ‘flatter’ look this time around and the OS looks very similar to iOS in many areas. When you pull down the notification screen, it is translucent, just like iOS 7. There are lots of things to like about KitKat such as – the Google Now integration throughout the OS, the local business/phonebook type search integrated into the Phone app, the new Hangouts app that also doubles as the messaging app, and the new full screen mode that is available with certain apps. </p>
<p> Final thoughts: </p>
<p> At $349 for the base 16GB model, the Nexus 5 is an incredible value for money. That is a lot of smartphone for that price. The 5″ 1080p screen combines with the new flatter clean KitKat OS to provide one of the best, if not the best, Android experiences on a phone. I strongly recommend anybody that is currently in the market for a smartphone to give the Nexus 5 a long hard look. </p>
<p> A full hands-on review of the Nexus 5 is in the works and should be released very soon and will include detailed testing of all aspects of the phone. But for now, you can’t really go wrong paying $349 for this latest Nexus device. </p>

This new Red color of the Nexus 5 is bright and the design along with the specifications remains the same. </p>
<p> Like the White Nexus 5 the Red version also features a colored backside and front earpiece with black colored rear camera, power button and volume buttons on its sides. The only difference we can see is, even the sides are in Red color in case of this new variant unlike like its siblings that had black sides. </p>
<p> So are you getting this new Bright Red variant of the Nexus 5? Planning to gift it to your Valentine on the scheduled Valentine’s Day on Feb 14? You can grab this device from the Google Play store. Stay tuned for more updates. </p>
<p> Earlier – Google Launching Red Nexus 5 for Valentines Day? – Details – February 1,2014 </p>
<p> Google seems to be in a mood to delight the smartphone users by offering Red colored Nexus 5 Android smartphone ahead of the Valentines day which is on Feb. 14. While Google hasn’t made any announcement, but all thanks to the evleaks who has mentioned that on February 4th, this device will be up for grabs in the Google PLAY Store. Just in case if you missed, we have listed all the specs and features below; </p>
<p> Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Compass, Proximity/Ambient Light and Pressure sensors </p>
<p> 2,300 mAh with wireless charging </p>
<p> We will keep you posted as soon as we get to hear something from Google in terms of price and availability. </p>
<p> Earlier: </p>
<p> Nexus 5 is going to get some changes to its hardware from post release to fix the problems that went unnoticed, which went for sale in hundreds of thousands. It happened even with the predecessor (Nexus 4) before. This problem with the Nexus 5 hardware came into lime light when there was a discussion on the Forum of the XDA-Developers regarding some of the hardware problems from the batch marked 311k on the box. Any how this is a common problem faced by all the hardware manufactures. Earlier in Nexus 4, the glass of the rear was little fragile and was prone to scratches and also for cracking, so tiny rubber nipples were added to it to overcome the problems faced. </p>
<p> A costumer returned his faulty handset and got a new variant from Google with all the problems of the old one getting fixed. The problems were regarding the cutting-edge display frame, noisy and shaky buttons and a protruding SIM tray. The old and new device were put side by side and found out that they have a different shell. The revised Nexus 5 had a bigger speaker holes compared to the older one (which gave a buzzy noise) and the buttons were sturdier too. The display also didn’t have any yellow tint in it. </p>
<p> Google stepped up and took immediate steps to eliminate the hardware problems. The customers will definitely be unpleased with the earlier handsets that had the hardware malfunctions, but now will be relived because Google is going to get them replaced. </p>
<p> So for all the Google Nexus 5 users having the hardware problems, you can exchange your phone for a newer one. If you are facing any hardware problems other than these, then let us know. Comment in the comment section if you are satisfied with the response of Google. </p>
<p> Update : Nov 20, 2013 Pradeep Neela : The Nexus 5 is finally available at the Play Store in India officially, and the users who were waiting for this to be officially available can order that directly and the delivery would take 2-7 business days. As mentioned earlier too, there are two storage options and two color options, and the prices are Rs. 28,999 for the 16GB and Rs. 32,999 for the 32GB versions, and the price is same for both the Black and White variants. </p>
<p> The Nexus 5 from LG is being sold in India now, as Flipkart has listed the smartphone for sale on its online store and the pricing for that is quite high, with the 16GB Nexus 5 being available for Rs. 30999 and that is the only storage option available for now. This is still good enough for those who wanted to have the Nexus 5 with actual Indian warranty, as this is what is included – 1 year manufacturer warranty for Phone and 6 months warranty for in the box accessories LG India Warranty and Free Transit Insurance. </p>
<p> You will now get to pre-order the LG Nexus 5 from Snapdeal in India, apart from Flipkart where it was already listed. You will have to pay Rs. 999 as the initial pre-order fee and the actual price of the Nexus 5 from Snapdeal is Rs. 28,999 for the 16GB version, which was the actual price on the Google Play Store too. </p>
<p> The LG Nexus 5 is officially launched, and the Play Store might already be getting innumerable number of hits from fans all around, who would be trying to order the smartphone already which is available in quite a few countries, including US and UK. The pricing of the Nexus 5 is just as it was leaked, with the 16GB and 32GB devices being available for $349 and $399 in the US, and the Indian pricing is Rs. 28999 and Rs. 32999 respectively. </p>
<p> Against the leaks, there are no different battery capacities and it’s the same one in both the variants, and it is a 4.95-inch Full HD display, with most of the other specifications just as they were leaked by the canadian carrier a day ago. The smartphone would run the Android 4.4 KitKat OS, and its the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor clocking at 2.3GHz under the hood, along with 2 GB of RAM. </p>
<p> The rear shooter is of 8-megapixel and it comes with the Optical Image Stabilization, and there is a 1.3-megapixel front facing camera. </p>
<p> Earlier: As the title suggests, it’s LG again. Today there are many hints that the Smart Phone would get officially announced by Google along with the Android 4.4 Kitkat version. This is the second Nexus device from LG and all the official specifications of the Nexus 5 are leaked already prior to the launch of the smartphone, and this is all thanks to Wind Mobile, the Canadian carrier who set up a pre-registration page which had the A to Z details of the smartphone. </p>
<p> Thanks to the redditter throwawaynexus5guy, we have a few screenshots of the Phone. </p>
<p> The leaked specs this time again aren’t any different from the earlier leaks because we get to see the Snapdragon 800 processor under the 4.95-inch Full HD display, but the camera is still an 8-megapixel shooter. It still is expected to do some good capturing with the OIS feature (which was seen in the LG G2 recently). It would run the Android 4.4 KitKat OS. </p>
<p> Earlier: After Google had held the Play Store night party where nothing actually related to the Android products happened, there is still no confirmation about the actual date of announcement of the Nexus 5. One of the very well known leaker on the web, Evleaks, has tipped us with yet another press render with White color being showcased, and they even tipped us with the date of announcement, which would possibly be 1st November. </p>
<p> The renders show that the phone isn’t entirely white, and thus looks more appealing because of the white front color. That could be either the October 31st or November 1st as the 1/11 date can be when the phone gets launched. </p>
<p> Earlier: </p>
<p> Nexus 5 Android Phone was supposed to get announced on 18th this month alongside Kit Kat Android 4.4 OS, but unfortunately we got to hear no announcement. Though, Google didn’t launch the details about the Nexus 5 officially, the listing of Nexus 5 accidentally got leaked on Google PLAY Store. Though, the Gooogle Store Link is dead now, many of them managed to sneak through on how this Nexus 5 looks like. Its almost the same as the few concepts which we all must have seen somewhere. We have also mentioned the picture of NEXUS 5. </p>
<p> We caught Google promoting this product as “Capture the everyday and the epic in fresh new ways. Starting at $349”. The pricing of this starts from $349 if we go as per the listing and is only available in Black Color to start with. We will keep you posted about all the latest on Nexus 5. </p>
<p> Earlier: Oct 12th 2013 by Chetan Bhawani The Nexus 5 pictures were just leaked and now the most important part, the pricing of the device have been leaked and it shows that the battery depends on the storage of the device. Each model of the device has got a different battery capacity. Here’s the details: </p>
<p> 16GB LG Nexus 5 – 2300 mAh battery – $299 </p>
<p> 32GB LG Nexus 5 – 3000 mAh battery – $399 </p>
<p> Meanwhile do reply in the following poll and let us know with your choice : </p>
<p> [poll id=”4″] </p>
<p> It is interesting to see that the battery is different in both, but that could disappoint the users who are considering to purchase the 16GB model, because the other internal specs are still the same. Last year, the Nexus 4 came with the 8GB and 16GB models, and both of them had the same 2100 mAh battery in them, and the pricing was $299 and $349 respectively. </p>
<p> Check out soon for more details. </p>
<p> Earlier: Oct 7th 2013 by Chetan Bhawani A recent leak of the Service Manual has revealed most of the official specifications of the Nexus 5 device that is to come very soon. The phone, modeled LG-D821, is going to come with a 4.95-inch 1080p display and it would be powered by a 2.3 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, and as is the trend with the Nexus devices, it would be the latest OS version of Android that the Nexus 5 would run, i.e. the Android 4.4 KitKat. </p>
<p> A couple leaked photos along with this manual showed the side SIM card slot and the removable back cover. The other expected specs of the device include a 8-megapixel camera with OIS, 1080p video recording, 2300 mAh battery with the wireless charging. </p>
<p> Earlier: Sep 17th 2013 by Chetan Bhawani The Nexus 5 was just being rumored and there was just a single leaked photo available earlier to this, but now the benchmarking website GFXBench has leaked almost the entire specifications list and a press shot of the device. The device is codenamed Hammerhead, and the leaked specifications include as follows: </p>
<p> Resolution of screen: 1794 x 1080 pixels </p>
<p> 2GB of RAM </p>
<p> Earlier: By Pradeep Neela on Sep 14th, 2013 Now, not just the Nexus 5 picture is out but it’s the internal detailing and the parts that have made an appearance online via the leaks and this was found at the FCC Certification, thus we would be seeing the device pretty soon along with the announcement of the Android 4.4 KitKat version. It’s the LG D820 model which passed the FCC certification. We have mentioned some of the Pictures of the Nexus 5 smartphone which was caught at the FCC. </p>
<p> Source: The Verge </p>
<p> Earlier: Sep 4th 2013 by Pradeep Neela While Google and LG are still tight lipped on the upcoming Nexus 5 Android smartphone which is now long awaited, in the recent KitKat’s statue erection Video, camera seems to have caught the upcoming Nexus 5 Android smartphone mistakenly. Oops Google! Camera has got you! When asked to LG Electronics, LG refused to comment on this and further added that it has nothing to comment on specifically on Nexus 5 as of now. Though, Google has removed the Video from its official website, we have mentioned the image below for your ready reference; </p>
<p> Update on 18/3/2013 In the latest, Google is set to be working with Nikon to bring on board Nikon’s expertise to the next version of Nexus 5. If you could just recollect, then Google and Nikon have worked together in coming out with the Nikon Coolpix S800C smart camera which is based on Android OS. Also, Google has acquired Nik software last year who are the makers of the popular app “Snapseed” and in which Nikon has invested substantially. So, indirectly Nikon and Google wants to leverage each other’s expertise. Google wants to have a level playing field with Nokia’s Pure View technology, HTC’s Ultrapixel war and Apple iPhone’s brilliant camera. </p>
<p> Updated on 16/3/2013 After riding success of Nexus 4 from LG Electronics, it now seems that LG bought an amazing technology on the table for Google for the second time as well. If we go as per the Rumors then LG and Google might just release the much awaited sequel to hit that is for Nexus 4 dubbed as Nexus 5. If Nexus 5 is launched by LG then this is the second time that a Nexus device is being launched twice by any handset manufacturer, as Samsung had come up with the Nexus S and then the Galaxy Nexus. Nexus 5 is slated to arrive this Google IO event which is scheduled for MAY 2013. So, let’s check on what are the purported specs and features of this Nexus 5 in the due course of this article. </p>
<p> Purported Specs and Features of LG Nexus 5: LG Nexus 5 is slated to come with the state of the art features which not just includes the OLED display which was talked about the most in CES 2013. LG Nexus 5 is pegged to come with the 5.2 inches of Full HD 1080p OLED Display along with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor which is clocked at 2.3GHz. Nexus 5 is also rumored to come with the highest 3GB of RAM, 16 / 32/ 64 GB of internal memory option with no signs of external SD card slot, 2.1MP of front facing camera along with the 16MP of rear camera with 4K recording capability at 30 FPS and 1080p Quality. And Oh! Buoy, if we got as per the rumours then this device is pegged to come with super huge 3300mAH of battery life.

<p> 3GB RAM, </p>
<p> 16 / 32 / 64 GB of Internal Memory Option, </p>
<p> 16MP Rear Camera with 4K Video Support @ 30FPS and 1080P Video Recording at 60FPS, </p>

<p> Note: Please note that the specs mentioned below for LG Nexus 5 are only mentioned based on the speculations and rumours. We will keep you posted about all the latest on the specs front as in when we come across with any info about the same. </p>
<p> Pricing and Availability: We will keep you posted about the exact details of Nexus 5 Availability and pricing but as per the close sources, Nexus 5 is slated for the showcase in the upcoming Google IO event which is scheduled in this May 2013 and is expected to be priced around $399 / $449 / $499 for 16 / 32 / 64 GB variant. The reason for such a pricing makes sense as the BOM (Bill of Material) cost for making the above specs laden phone is no more than $249 and considering a premium of around $100+ as Google will save on marketing cost and other dealer incentives for selling its Nexus 5 smartphone. </p>
<p> Quote: ” If Nexus 5 is launched by LG then this is the first time that a Nexus device is being launched twice by any handset manufacturer.” </p>
<p> What about Nexus S (based on Samsung Galaxy S) and Galaxy Nexus (based on Samsung Galaxy S2) ? </p>
<p> AAh nexus is one of my favorite series…. and i m waiting for nexus 5 launch from long time….. Hope it will launch soon….. Thanks for giving this updates….. </p>
<p> Right… So…. Nothing to add. No release date? No factual specs? Nothing “hard” to report? I guess they’ve got until October 2. No hard release date by then, and I’m scooping up a note 3 lol </p>
<p> And to add to this fine piece of journalism : Nexus 5 will run on solar powered cells,its Bluetooth will emit peace and love and the WiFi is supposedly a beacon of hope. </p>
<p> I think the author wanted to say that it would be the first time two Nexus devices are launched in the same year by the same manufacturer. </p>
<p> Jesus Christ ,this is supposed to be journalism… And they are specialised about android no less. And yet they don’t know Samsung made 3 nexus devices for Google. 2 freakin phones and 1 tablet. Yeah,never before my boot! </p>
<p> I think you are wrong in this line -> If Nexus 5 is launched by LG then this is the first time that a Nexus device is being launched twice by any handset manufacturer. Samsung launched the Nexus S (Dec, 2010) and Galaxy Nexus (Nov, 2012). Means Nexus device is launched by Samsung twice. </p>
<p> lg too lame.. nexus 4 camera too bad.. hope google works on nexus with others campany </p>
<p> “If Nexus 5 is launched by LG then this is the first time that a Nexus device is being launched twice by any handset manufacturer.” </p>
<p> Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, and Nexus 10 weren’t all made by the same manufacture? </p>
<p> nexus S , Galaxy nexus, nexus 10 and up coming nexus 11 made by Samsung…. just clearly say u hate samsung….. </p>
<p> Didn’t Samsung launch 2 Nexus devices, specifically the Nexus S and the Galaxy Nexus? </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Google Nexus 5 vs Nexus 4 Comparison – Is the new Nexus 5 worth an Upgrade? </p>
<p> Google has just launched the Nexus 5, the flagship smartphone for this year along with the Android 4.4 KitKat OS. The makers are again the same – LG. The smartphone has come with quite a lot of changes, in size, in the internal power provided but the main fact that would bring in a lot of attention – same pricing. For us, it is already worth an upgrade because of the changes made, which in the current time are the best in the market for the pricing asked. But let’s see how Google has improved the overall device to release the Nexus 5. </p>
<p> Display, Design </p>
<p> Design wise there’s not a lot to talk about the Nexus 5, but some disappointment would be for the hood on the back for the camera. That would not make the phone lay flat on the table, and that again would make the glass easily prone to any scratches. The hardness of it cannot be already tested, but LG has given enough protection around the lens. But the overall design is quite decent, just like it was with the Nexus 4. The power and volume buttons in the Nexus 5 have got a ceramic powering and there are two microphones contrary to one in the Nexus 4. </p>
<p> Display is changed quite a lot – you get to see a Full HD display now, with the 445 ppi pixel density, as well as a protection by Gorilla Glass 3. In the Nexus 4, it was the Gorilla Glass 2 protection on the HD display with resolution 1280 x 768 pixels, which has a pixel density of 320 ppi. With the new glass protection technology, the resistance to scratches and damage goes to 3x in the new Nexus. </p>
<p> Processor, RAM and GPU </p>
<p> The processor packed into the Nexus 5 is Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 (the same which we saw in the LG G2, US version of Note 3), while it was the Snapdragon S4 Pro in the Nexus 4. The clocking speeds are 2.3 GHz and 1.5 GHz for the quad-core chipsets respectively. The graphics performance too is enhanced, with the latest Adreno 330 GPU powering the Nexus 5, while it was the Adreno 320 in the Nexus 4. </p>
<p> We haven’t tested the Nexus 5, but from what we get to know through the different sources, the Nexus 5 blows away the Nexus 4 in terms of overall performance. Both of them have got the 2GB RAM though. </p>
<p> Camera </p>
<p> Both the smartphones have got a 8-megapixel camera on the rear side, but two reasons why we expect the Nexus 5 camera to be easily better than that of its predecessor, are: </p>
<p> Optical Image Stabilization – we mentioned quite a few times why the 13MP camera of LG G2 captured better photos than the 13MP camera of Note 3 and Galaxy S4. The same is now included in the Nexus 5 camera </p>
<p> HDR+ – the list of Android 4.4 featuers included the HDR+ as a feature exclusively for the Nexus 5 for now, although the Nexus 4 might be running the 4.4 version any time soon. </p>
<p> The front camera is the same in both, a 1.3-megapixel shooter which is not expected to do any exceptional stuff. The rear camera in both the devices would capture 1080p Full HD videos. </p>
<p> Battery & Storage </p>
<p> The battery included in the LG Nexus 4 had a capacity of 2100 mAh, while that in the Nexus 5 is 2300 mAh and thus there are some extra hours of talk time or usage. Both the smartphones support wireless charging. The Nexus 5 has got the LTE support and it is said to provide 7 hours of battery life on LTE data connectivity. </p>
<p> The storage options for the Nexus 5 are – 16GB and 32GB, while the Nexus 4 had come with the 8GB and 16GB internal storage and both of them have no support for the MicroSD cards. The pricing of the versions depend on the storage included. </p>
<p> Connectivity Options </p>
<p> This is yet another area where the Nexus 5 sees some boost, because there is an addition of two new options – </p>
<p> Dual Band Wi-Fi </p>
<p> LTE </p>
<p> The other common options that we see are the Android Beam NFC, Bluetooth (4.0 version in Nexus 5) and the Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n. </p>
<p> Is the Nexus 5 worth an upgrade? </p>
<p> When you look at the price charts, there’s no question why you shouldn’t be upgrading this if you are looking for a new smartphone with the latest best specifications. The Nexus 5 shows an improvement in every aspect, and Google has kept the pricing at $349 and $399 for the 16GB and 32GB versions, which is no different from the predecessor. The operating system version should be the same very soon in both, as the Nexus 4 is one of the devices to receive Android 4.4 update. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Google Nexus 5 with Sprint available for $49.99 on Contract, $449.99 off-Contract! </p>
<p> The newly launched Nexus 5 from Google has been made available on the Play Store already, but with the various networks in the US, it is slowly showing up and one of the early birds here is the Sprint network, which would be selling the Nexus 5 for just $49.99 with a new 2-year contract, and this offer has popped up on Amazon. But crazily, Sprint has kept a price of $449.99 for the unlocked one which the users wanted without a plan – $100 more than what it is available for at the Play Store. </p>
<p> This off-contract pricing is only on Amazon because this price is again $50 higher than what Sprint charges on their official site, so we don’t find a reason why one would want to buy an off-contract device from Sprint on Amazon. The offer on Amazon that one can take advantage of to save some money, is the contract one with Sprint, as this is one of the high-end smartphones you are getting for an initial pay of $50. </p>
<p> Here’s the math for the pricing set by Sprint for Nexus 5 on Amazon: </p>
<p> Regular Price $449.99 </p>
<p> Instant Savings -$250.00 </p>
<p> Web Only – Switch & Save -$100.00 </p>
<p> Mail-in Rebate via Reward Card -$50.00 </p>
<p> So the final pricing comes down to $49.99. A pretty good deal, right? The buyback offer with Sprint can take it further if you are willing to sell off your current phone before buying the Nexus 5, because you can sell it off to Sprint, even if the device is from the other networks. Though you might not get what you expect from a particular smartphone (we tried the LG G2 and the credits we were getting is $115). </p>
<p> The Nexus 5 comes with a 4.95-inch Full HD display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB RAM, 2300 mAh battery packed in, and it runs the latest Android 4.4 KitKat OS. Head over to Amazon to check out the deal, and if you opt to use the network, go for the offer right away. </p>

<p> Google Nexus Foo appeared with Full HD 10.3″ Display & Tegra 4 Processor </p>
<p> Recently, it was believed that HTC is in the run to make the next generation nexus tablet, until today. The benchmarking website, GFXBench has an interesting addition to its latest database. The device goes by the name Google Nexus Foo has appeared on the popular benchmarking website. </p>
<p> According to the GFX Bench, the Google Nexus Foo will feature a 10.3-inch (1920 x 1080 pixels resolution) display, a 1.9 GHz Tegra 4 processor and 2GB of RAM. Although, it is notable that the screen present on this device is not the touch screen, which initiate the prime concern that the information posted regarding this device on GFXBench is probably false. So, we’re not sure that this is a tablet, let alone a real device. </p>
<p> Additionally, it has no rear-camera, but features a single (unspecified pixels) front-facing camera. And the device also poorly lacks in the sensors, there is an absence of accelerometer, barometer, gyroscope, lightsensor, proximity, compass, and GPS. The only connectivity options present on this device are Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. There is no SIM card slot present in this device, so 3G connection support is out of the picture. </p>
<p> The strangest thing about this device is that it is listed to be running Android KKWT, which is the Android Wear build number. And the device is also in support with the OpenGL ES 2.0, which is more linked with the Android Wear OS. To give you a basic understanding, the recent versions of Android (4.3 Jelly Bean or 4.4 KitKat) use OpenGL 3.0, and with Android L the OpenGL 3.1 is introduced. Basically, nothing about this device makes any reasonable sense. So, we advise you to take this rumor as a grain of salt. </p>

<p> Google Nexus One – Steps to Install Android 2.3 Gingerbread OS </p>
<p> What if Google came with a new phone with the latest Gingerbread in it in the latest Nexus S. If you own an earlier version of Google Android Nexus One device, then here’s great news for all of you as now today we will see on how you can install the latest Gingerbread 2.3 on your Nexus One, yes you have heard it right. Gingerbread on Google Nexus One. Though it is not official but since it is an open source device many builds are made un officially which can be installed in your device. So let’s quickly proceed and look on how you can install Gingerbread on Google’s Nexus One device. It is highly recommended to take necessary backup of all contacts, messages and other information which is stored in the device though the data in SD card will be safe and also most importantly please follow the steps carefully or else your phone may become unusable. </p>
<p> Now, read this step carefully, if you are at presently running on a stock Nexus One, then you will need custom recovery for flashing the Gingerbread build into your Nexus One. But for this you need to download Amon Ra’s Recovery and then you need to copy the same to /tools folder of your Android SDK directory. You can download the Android 2.3 SDK from here. Please note that if you already have custom recovery then directly you can proceed to recovery as mentioned after 2 steps below. </p>
<p> Now simply you need to reboot the phone into the boot loader mode which can be achieved by first turning off the device, holding the trackball and then press the power button after which you need to connect the Nexus One with your computer. Make sure your hboot version is 35.0017 after the reboot. </p>
<p> Now, key in the fastboot flash recovery xx where xx suggests the exact file name of the recovery image which is downloaded, including the extension name. </p>
<p> Now you need to enter the recovery mode and need to choose boot loader option from the long list and then you need to select recovery option and then you need to Wipe data and cache from that list only so as to fasten up your device as all the cache system content which is not useful gets deleted. It is recommended to empty or wipe the cache contents </p>
<p> Now you need to flash the gingerbread_passion.ctso.zip file which you have downloaded in the above step into your Nexus One. </p>
<p> After flashing you need to simply reboot. Bingo! There you go you have now successfully upgraded your Nexus One with the latest Android 2.3 Gingerbread version. </p>
<p> However, the phone went into an endless reboot. I flash back to Cyanogen 6.1.0 (early Dec, 2010) release and added the add-on and so far, I am good. Looking forward to getting the Google tools in 2.3. </p>
<p> I got it installed after rooting my N1. Now, I am trying to figure out what OS this is. It looks like a CyanogenMod-7.0.0-Alpha-N1 I am not sure that was what I was expecting. It does say Android Version 2.3.1. The first thing I wanted to do is connect my Google Account up and there is no provisioning. So I am a little thrown. I’ll hunt around a bit more. </p>

<p> Which Android App is the Best – Google PDF Viewer or Adobe Reader? – With APKs </p>
<p> While there are many PDF readers on Google Play Store and since most of the devices doesn’t have the native PDF openers the need for one app is a must. The reason for this article is simply because of an all new app from Google which is dubbed as “PDF Viewer”. Considering the fact that PDF has always remained very closely with Adobe as no other app is as popular as Adobe PDF for obvious reasons, let’s check out on how Google PDF Viewer app is when it comes to features. This new app from Google is a step towards strengthening its foothold even in the apps which are used by most of the users on Android ecosystem. </p>
<p> Google PDF Viewer: </p>
<p> To start off, this app is free to download app for all android users. This app lets users to view all the PDF files which are stored in the device, but currently this app doesn’t offer feature to edit the PDF files in any option. This app has the capability to search through all the PDF files which are there in the device. This app from Google is mainly for the users of “Google For Work” Program but this app can be used by all the users irrespective of the country/ region you are from. Even if you are using this app for the very first time, this app is very friendly in use. We have also shown some of the screen captures below with more details on what are the options available in the Google PDF Viewer app. </p>
<p> Adobe’s PDF Viewer too is a free to use app with which you can easily view the PDFs in your device and also this app opens all the PDF files from web, email and from other apps along with the share button. The best part of this app is that this app also allows users to highlight, make notes and also lets users to leave a sticky note feature. Adding to the list of features, this device also comes with the night mode and brightness lock for easy reading experience. Also, this one allows users to create the new PDFs and also one can experience added features like sign the documents, esign with the help of finger and also users can store, share and print the documents easily in the premium version of app. </p>
<p> So, all in all while Google’s PDF Viewer app is nowhere near when compared with the features offered by Adobe. Going down the line Google might want to add more meat to its own PDF app. Do let us know in the comments section just in case if you used both the apps. </p>

<p> Google Play – How to auto-update apps </p>
<p> Do you feel annoying with the app updates popping up frequently on your Android smartphone? There is a simple solution for this; Google Play Store has given the option of auto updating the apps without having to do manually every time without any interaction from you. Below are the easy ways to set the apps on your device to auto-update. </p>
<p> Go to the Google Play Store on your device </p>
<p> Tap on the menu that is located on the top left corner </p>
<p> Now click on Settings </p>
<p> Under the General, we have the option called Auto-update apps </p>
<p> After clicking this option, you will be getting three more options as </p>
<p> Do not auto-update apps </p>
<p> Auto-update apps at any time </p>
<p> Auto-update apps over Wifi only </p>
<p> The Do not auto-update apps option will completely turn off the auto-updates and you will be receiving a notification whenever there is an update available. </p>
<p> Auto-update apps at any time option will auto-update the apps with your permission, whenever there is an update available. This happens whenever there is internet connection, be it on Wi-Fi or on cellular data. </p>
<p> The Auto-update apps over Wifi only option will update the apps only when the device is connected to a Wi-Fi network and do not use your cellular data. </p>
<p> I would rather prefer using the Auto-update apps over Wi-Fi only option because, the apps will be updated where ever the device connects with Wi-Fi and moreover its saves lot of the cellular data and we don’t have to worry about high data bills. </p>
<p> Note – If you are enabling the automatic updates, you won’t be able to accept the permissions of all the updates, only if they are included in a permission group that has been already accepted. And these app needs access to additional permission and you need to accept them manually even if you are on the auto-update mode. </p>
<p> You also have the option of updating one particular app that you want to use it on cellular data if you are on Auto-update apps over Wifi only. You just need to go to that particular app and manually update the app. </p>
<p> So this is a simple way to get rid of those annoying updates every time. And make sure you wont be able to read the changelogs if you are auto updating. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Google Play – How to clear search and apps history </p>
<p> Everyone wants to clear the history on their device regularly, be it official or unofficial data. Google play store is another place where it shows the entire search and the app history. Whatever is the reason, you would like to delete all the information but some find it difficult to do so. Google made sure that you can delete all the information easily so that you do not have that big list of history. Below are the steps to overcome the issue and clear it easily. </p>
<p> Go to the Play Store app from your smartphone </p>
<p> Open the menu that is located on the top, toward left </p>
<p> Now click on the Settings option </p>
<p> Under General, you can find the Clear search history option </p>
<p> From here, you can easily clear all the search history of your Google Play Store. Isn’t that simple? Well, deleting the list of apps that you have purchased, or downloaded is not that easy. We do not have the option of clearing all this data at one, so you have to do it manually by selecting each app. </p>
<p> Open the Play Store app and go to the Settings </p>
<p> Now, tap on My apps </p>
<p> Here you will be getting the list of installed apps and all apps on the top. Not click on the all option, and you can find a cross mark on the apps that are not installed on the device. You just have to click on the cross mark to remove that un-installed app from the list. You can also delete the apps that you have installed on the device and do not want to use it anymore. Just click on the app that you want to remove, and you will get the option of uninstall on it. </p>
<p> It is easy to clear out the applications, but it will consume your time if you have a big list. Drop your comment if have more queries around it. </p>

<p> Google Play Store Paid Apps in India gets INR Pricing </p>
<p> The Google Play Store is the backbone of Android success in the market. Android Marketplace which is now known as Google Play Store is the place where Android powered smart phone users can download apps which are collection of tools, widgets, wallpapers and games. The apps listed in Google Play Store mostly are free to use and are been submitted by various partnered developers. Not all the apps are free and this is where paid apps comes into scenario. </p>
<p> You might be wondering how will users pay for a paid app? Not to worry as Google has simplified things into easy manner. You might be aware of Google Wallet the online payment processor launched by internet giant. You need to login into Google Wallet account using the same Gmail ID by which you have registered your Android phone and then attach your Credit Card (provide your Credit Card info) with Google Wallet. Once that is done you can easily purchase apps. We have gone through an exclusive guide on how you can purchase an Android app using the Google Wallet directly on your mobile phone. </p>
<p> Over a period of times the Google Play Store will not be limited to apps and widgets but Google has plans to introduce several of their services like Google Music, Google Movies, Google Books, Google TV and lot more in development. Several of these features have been introduces for the users in United States and other countries but as of now it’s not seen available for the India users. </p>
<p> One of the biggest concerns about purchasing a paid app in Google Play is that you are not sure how much you are charged in your local Indian currency. Each app is listed with its price but the currency used is United States Dollars. Before anyone raises a voice, Google takes action and have introduces apps payment in Indian currency of Rupees. So all the paid apps accessed on to Google Play Store in India will carry prices in Indian Rupee (INR). </p>
<p> All the developers have been notified to set prices for their paid apps in INR and they can do it by October 25. If not Google will automatically assign the INR prices to each paid apps. Interestingly all the payment to the app developers however will be made in one currency ie., USD which is the currency of Google Checkout account. </p>
<p> Along with this introduction in India, Google has enabled the same for the buyer’s in Russian. </p>

<p> How to Activate & Use Guest Mode on LG G Pro 2 </p>
<p> You always are worried to hand over your device to any known ones, because they might be accessing your personal content, right? That’s when there is a need for a separate mode is needed in the device so that you can give limited access to the content, and if possible, give access to only a few apps which do not show any personal information. </p>
<p> There is a separate guest mode provided in the LG G Pro 2 which does what you desire – keep the content private and provide just a limited number of applications available for usage. </p>
<p> Now, to enable the guest mode you need to go to Settings > General > Personal > Guest mode and there, turn it on so that it takes you through the various set up options. You need to remember that there are two patterns you need to set for lock screen, one for the guest mode and one for the normal mode. The first one would be the guest mode lock screen pattern which is to be used when you wanted the device to enter the guest mode. </p>
<p> When you turn the Guest mode on, you will see a message “To use guest mode, set the Lock screen to pattern lock” and here you need to select “Pattern” as the locking option. Once the pattern is recorded and confirmed, you have to enter a backup PIN which comes handy when you forgot the pattern. The PIN would automatically be asked when the wrong pattern is entered for 5 times in a row. </p>
<p> Once these both are set, you will now have to set the pattern for the lock screen when you wanted to open the interface normally, and not enter the guest mode. All set, try to open the guest mode by going to the lock screen and using that pattern which you had set. It would welcome you with the four apps on the home screen – Camera, Videos, Music and Weather. Everything else gets hidden and inaccessible, and there’s no app drawer too. The photos and videos too are hidden, except for the ones which are captured while in the guest mode. How good is this, for content privacy? </p>
<p> There are a lot of applications which give such modes and separate interface when someone else is using the phone, but with the default option in the LG G Pro 2, it’s always good to use it. </p>

<p> When it comes to Android, customization is the key but when it comes to optimization, unfortunately the stock tools / options are not sufficient enough. So, to address this, here comes and all new android app which is dubbed as “Super Optimize”. This is of great help as we have tested this in the Nexus 4 smartphone which is currently encountering huge issues with the battery drain after it received the Jellybean 4.3 Android OS update as OTA. So, let’s check out on what are the features of this app. </p>
<p> Features of Super Optimize: </p>
<p> Super Optimize is a Free Android app which comes with enhanced features and capabilities which allows users to make the most of their battery by selecting each and every single parameter. While there are tons of apps which claim to help you save the battery but in return the very same apps are responsible for battery drain unlike this app called “Super Optimize”. Let’s check out the detailed feature list below; </p>
<p> Battery management: extend battery life by switching off components you don’t need. Put your phone into “Eco mode” with one tap. </p>
<p> System management: remove temporary files and claw back your precious disk space, app by app. Terminate apps and processes you don’t need. </p>
<p> Uninstall apps effortlessly: With just a tap, the app can be uninstalled, </p>
<p> History management: clear your call history, message drafts, email search history and more. </p>
<p> Transfer apps to and from the SD card: Hassle free transfer of apps from phone memory to memory card, </p>
<p> Manage volume and brightness settings in a simple interface. </p>
<p> To download the “Super Optimize” Android app, you can head over to the download this from the below mentioned link. Do let us know in the comments section on whether you liked this app or not. </p>
<p> I am running Android 4.1.2 on my S3 LTE but cannot transfer apps from my internal to my external SD card – the function does not appear in settings. Do you know why? As for those worried about the phone call permission, you can remove that one permission using an app like permission manager which deletes the app -removes the permission then reinstalls it with that permission gone of course you must first root your phone to do this. </p>
<p> Displayed ads every time I started it up,which is annoying but understandable in a free app, but soon started sending push ads, including SMS ads.That is not acceptable,so I uninstalled. Perhaps you should check apps out moe thoroughly before recommending them.I’m a lot more hesitant now to follow your advice. </p>
<p> please be aware that there was no response to my email to the developers asking them why it is necessary to be able to make phone calls from the app. </p>
<p> The thing I didn’t like about the app was after installing was the ads that popped up and the feature to move apps to sd. We all know that since jellybean you can no longer do that so why have a feature you can’t even use uninstalled. </p>
<p> This app pushs ads. It’s full of adware. Lookout doesn’t pick it up but Norton Mobile did. </p>
<p> The Google play page says this is not compatible with my Nexus 7 with Android 4.3 </p>
<p> I read your review and recommendation of super optimize. I downloaded, and while the app was being scanned by my virus scan, the virus scan found it to be malware. I immediately uninstalled. Have you found this app to be malware? or is it because of its system management and altering capabilities that it is flagged by antivirus as malware? </p>

Have you found this app to be malware? or is it because of its system management/altering capabilities that it is flagged by antivirus as malware? </p>
<p> wonder why the app needs to make phone calls. will not install until I get an answer! </p>
<p> Loved dripper since I downloaded it but this app super optimizer makes me nervous. Once I get to permission settings it says it will be able to make calls and send text messages… Could you please explain why I would allow an app to do that or is there another reason? Your assistance will be greatly appreciated. Samsung S3 </p>
<p> wonder why the app needs to make phone calls…will not install until I get an answer. </p>

<p> HCL ME Android Tablets Models Features Photos & Pricing </p>
<p> HCL Computers, which is one of the largest Indian computer giants has now silently stepped in the shoes of Android Tablet computing by launching the Me range of HCL Android tablets, with no prior experience in tablets this is the first ever HCL came out with its tablet range in three different variants which varies from 7 inches to the 10 inches. In the Android tablet range, HCL launched two versions of 7 inched tablets and one variant of 10 inch tablet. So, let’s check out all the three different versions of Android tablet one by one in the due course of the article. </p>
<p> HCL ME Tablet AE7-A1 </p>
<p> Specifications and Features: Straight away this Android tablet comes with Froyo 2.2 version unlike some other tablets in the market which come with Android 2.1 version though it can be upgraded to Android 2.2 version. Apart from the Froyo Operating system, this tablet comes with the ARM Processor with 800 MHz processing speed along with the 7 inch Resistive Touch Screen display 800 x 480 pixel resolution with 256 MB of DDR 2 RAM, NAND Flash 2 GB which is in built on board along with the Micro SD card which can be expanded up to 8 GB. If we talk of other standard features then this one comes with GPS, WiFi support with 802.11 b/g support, Blue tooth 2.0 with Enhanced Data Rate EVDO dongle with the USB integration support and also the 0.3 MP camera along with the Orientation G Sensor. In all this tablet weighs 400 gms. </p>
<p> Multimedia and Battery: The other multimedia support includes 3.5 mm jack, USB 2.0 Support, SD / MMC support with inbuilt high quality support. If we talk of battery life then this Android tablet comes with Built in Li Polymer rechargeable 2400 Mah support and also this tablet supports MP3 files with bit rate from (64-320Kbps). </p>
<p> Cost and Availability: This 7 incher tablet comes at a cost of Rs. 14, 990 which comes with the warranty of 1 year and can be purchased from all the leading electronic mega stores and can also be bought from the HCL web stores. </p>
<p> Pros: Comes with a huge battery power of 2400Mah, Comes at an affordable cost compared to other 7 incher tablets </p>
<p> Cons: Resistive touch is simply not worth of. Worst camera clarity as it has just a mere 0.3 MP camera Very bulky as it weighs a whopping 400 gms </p>
<p> Gallery: </p>
<p> Final Verdict: If you are the one who wishes to taste an Android tablet with Froyo in it and has a budget constraint then only this one is advised or else there is no reason on why you want to buy this. </p>
<p> HCL ME Tablet AM7-A1 </p>
<p> Specifications and Features: With a second and improved 7 incher tablet, this model of Android tablet comes with a better set of functionalities and offerings as this one not only comes with the Froyo 2.2 version of Android operating system version but also comes along with specs like 512 MB of DDR RAM, 8GB of i-NAND which is in built and also comes with the microSD card slot which can withstand a max memory of 16 GB. Other standard feature list includes A-GPS support, Bluetooth 2.1 with EDR and also has 3G and WCDMA capabilities with WiFi 802.11 b/g support. This tablet in all weighs a decent 300 grams which is lesser by 100 grams than the previous version which is stated above. Not to forget this Android tablet is powered by a high performance Cortex A8 800 MHz processor. </p>
<p> Multimedia and battery: With a 1.3 MP camera along with the G Sensor with a Full HD video support and MMC/ SD card support slot with a direct Plug and play USB support with a standard 3.5 mm jack and a 2 x 1w speakers which are of high quality. If we talk of the battery then this one comes with almost the double battery life than the previous version which is mentioned above as this one comes with the super 4200 MAH of battery strength. </p>
<p> Cost and Availability: This 7 incher tablet comes with a sticker price of Rs. 22, 900 which comes with the warranty of 1 year and can be purchased from all the leading electronic mega stores and can also be bought from the HCL web stores. </p>
<p> Pros: Comes with the better battery life Weighs lighter than previous version </p>
<p> Cons: You have better tablets at same cost which has a better name in tabs and support, No details on the future Android upgrade ability like 2.3 or 2.4 </p>
<p> Gallery: </p>
<p> Final Verdict: There is simply no point in buying this as in the same price range with the addition of just 2k bugs you have better tab available in the market in the form of Samsung’s Galaxy Tab which no doubt wins on every single parameter if compared with this one. So, no buy at least from me. The only reason to buy this is if you are getting this one at Rs. 15, 000 or probable free but definitely not more than 20k. </p>
<p> HCL ME Tablet AP10-A1 </p>
<p> Specifications and Features: With Android’s 2.2 Froyo packed in the 10.1 inches screen size, HCL has finally brought out a tablet which actually makes sense unlike the former two which are described above. In terms of specs, this one wins over in all terms as this one comes with a high performance ARM Cortex A9 1GHz processor, 1 GB of DDR2 RAM, 16 GB of i-NAND which is in built as usual with the microSD card slot which can hold up to 32 GB of space along with the Capacitive multi touch display with the maximum resolution of 1024 x 600 pixels. This one in all weighs a whopping 750 grams. </p>
<p> Multimedia and battery: If we spread the light on the multimedia offerings then this one comes with an improved WiFi with b/g/n support, Bluetooth 2.1 version with Enhanced data rate capability along with the built in 3G / HSDPA/ HSUPA along with the 1.3 MP camera and 3D accelerometer and with Full HD 1080p video recording capability. This tablet also boasts a 3.5 mm jack, USB 2.0 slot, SIM card slot, Ethernet Port, Speakers HDMI Port along with the better battery of a whopping 3650 Mah of battery strength. This tablet also supports wide range of codecs like MP3/WMA/OGG/AAC/AAC+/EAAC+/MIDI. </p>
<p> Cost and Availability: Hold your breath as this tablet with not so many features compared with the Apple iPads or with the well-known Galaxy Tab comes with a sticker price of Rs. 32, 900 which comes with the warranty of standard 1 year and can be purchased from all the leading electronic mega stores and can also be bought from the HCL web stores. </p>
<p> Pros: Better battery strength, Better Processor and Processing Speed </p>
<p> Cons: Very bulky as it weighs 750 grams Camera is just 1.3 MP. </p>
<p> Gallery: </p>
<p> Final Verdict: This is only suitable for those people who love HCL brand and also for all those who can’t think of a camera whose resolution are not more than 1.3 MP cameras. Valued at Rs. 33k is definitely not worth as the likes of Apple and Samsung Tabs are available at a much lower price than this. </p>

<p> HDFC Mobile Banking App for Android Review, Problems & Features </p>
<p> HDFC is an international Bank and the standards set by the bank are very high, HDFC Mobile Banking App is also a very good App to help its customers by getting Banking into the Palm of their hands. This App lets users do many of the things for which you had to go to the Bank or ATM and also things like Bill payments for multiple number of things from just one App. </p>
<p> With HDFC Mobile Banking app you can do the following: </p>
<p> Pay Utility bills like Telephone Bills etc. </p>
<p> You can also View your Account summaries and Fixed Deposit summaries right from your house without even turning on your System or Laptop. </p>

<p> You can Locate the nearest ATM or Bank Branch from the App </p>
<p> HDFC Mobile Banking app is a well designed App with clear and good User Interface which is very easy to use for a new user. The thing missing from this app is the option of Mobile Recharge and DTH Recharges like tata sky, reliance, dish tv which is present in almost all the other Bank Apps. </p>
<p> If you are accessing this app form a Tablet device the App will appear a bit stretched and I must say HDFC should look into it as this gives a very bad impression to users. </p>
<p> There is no option to pay your Credit card bill from this App but you can check the Credit card bill and its balance. </p>
<p> There is no Option to transfer funds through IMPS (Inter Bank Mobile Payment Service) and NEFT in the App </p>
<p> Other Apps like ICICI and Axis are having options like booking Airline, Train tickets directly from the app but this app does not have any such options for its users. </p>
<p> This app is accepted by almost all the Smartphones and have hardly heard any reports or Errors </p>

<p> High Speed internet tethering App for Android Phones </p>
<p> As discussed in the last articles we saw how to tether using PDANet and easy tether, so what’s the difference between the both. No need to analyze as we are here to present the same in a simple and easy manner. While PDA net will cost around 30$, easy tether will cost you around 10$. While easy tether offers you a trial period for a week’s time while PDANet lets you use a version that restricts HTTPS access for free, then charges for the full upgrade. Most of the cellular operators in US offers costlier tethering option if chosen one out of both tethering option then i would suggest to stay away from the cellular operator’s tethering option as the same cost can be recovered within 1-2 months depending upon your selection. </p>
<p> While PDANet offers Bluetooth based connection to you, easy tethering provides the USB connectivity. Now, if we look at the speed of data transfer after tethering then the speed just scales less than 2.5Mbps in download for easy tether and marginally less in PDANet tethering tool. There were many compatibility issues reported with PDANet but easy tether supports Android devices versions greater than Android versions of 1.5.While Tether downloads for free in the Android Market place but it asks for the license after the expiry of the trial period. Also if you are a MAC user then easy tether is not for you but if you are a windows or a Ubuntu user then PDA net is best suited for you. </p>

<p> I bought SPB Shell for my Samsung Infuse and at first it worked perfectly. Now, however, when I touch the home icon it goes back to my original home. I’ve been using Home Switcher and SPB shell will launch from there but I can’t set it as my default home. I keep getting a message when I try that says: </p>
<p> “Sorry! The application Home Switcher (process ymst.android.homeswitcher) has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again. Force close Report” </p>
<p> Installed in my GT I9000 (GB XXJVR 2.3.4 / Amestris 2.3.4 ROM). Really great animated features but I find the phone is very lagging. It takes a few seconds to open apps. Any way to solve this as I love their features. </p>
<p> Yes the app is working fine but how to ensure or test whether my phone is running at optimum performance? </p>
<p> The only thing missing are the samsung widgets, I really liked active application widget but is there any way to get samsung widgets in SPB shell. </p>
<p> r u from Hyderabad ???? as the location is set to Hyderabad in the app review …… just asking with curiosity as I am from Hyderabad …. </p>
<p> …yipiii….found da free version…ppl download it asap b4 link gets expired….heres da link……..www.megaupload.com/?d=VHPOJ4CG …. </p>
<p> Downloaded it but couldnt found icon & no option of OPEN after completion of download. pls help. </p>
<p> Which one did you download? The paid versions that we have gone through or the download version link provided in the comment? The free download versions may give your errors because its free where the original app is not. </p>
<p> I was having problem with free download version on my Samsung Galaxy ACE, however the same application is working on my brothers LG Optimus 1 with help of Home Switcher launcher. </p>
<p> You could recommend “Regina 3D” for those who can’t bear paying more than “Jero” (sic) 😉 It offers similar 3d-like homescreen flipping and works reasonably smoothly. SPB gave me a few laggy headaches and FCs on a Galaxy S while on Darky’s ROM (9.5 & 10.1). </p>
<p> Also, I suspect you mean “Launcher” instead of “Home switcher” in your headline. The latter sort of app allows one to switch *between* launchers, while a launcher, well, does what you’ve described in your article above. </p>
<p> Sure buddy we will sure come out with that article as well. Thanks again for ur comment. </p>
<p> you can download it free and install.but since you cannot control it’s access to the internet it will connect to market ,check for invalid copy and uninstall the copy </p>

<p> Hospital finder app for Android – Helps find hospital based on location </p>
<p> Google maps is there for any particular location, any particular landmark etc. but there is an application for Android phones which helps people find only the hospitals, clinics and health service places at and around any particular location, which is indeed a helpful thing when someone needs to find a health care center around the place they are, in emergency but can’t find anything through Google maps because of the limited knowledge of the usage where one could not sort the results in particular. </p>
<p> One of the best advantages of this Hospital Finder application is that you even get to know all the locations of the dental hospitals, apart from the medical health care centers, and you get the options to call the phone number given in the listing. i.e. you don’t need to type in the phone number by noting it down, but you can just click on the phone number and it would initiate the call. The application is linked to the Google maps from within its interface, and when you wanted to find the particular hospital and its location on the map, it would take you to the highest zoom and most of the other landmarks around it are given, making it easier for you to find the exact location while you are traveling. </p>
<p> In case one has an option to call in case of emergency, the services like Justdial would be helpful but for those with an internet as option to search, the Hospital Finder application is a lot helpful where you don’t have to search for the location and hospitals around, where you get the other listings such as restaurants, pubs, coffee lounges, banks, stations etc. along with the hospitals and health care centers which you are searching for. </p>
<p> Features of the Hospital Finder app for Android: </p>
<p> Enter your location, or it searches based on GPS – and it finds the hospitals around your location </p>
<p> Separate listing for each hospital, having options of calling the number, checking the details of the hospital </p>
<p> Opening the location of the hospital in Google maps, where people could search for the directions </p>
<p> Adding any hospital to the “My favorite” section, from where you could access it anytime without having to search for it again </p>
<p> If you are not familiar with the places which you are searching for, the option of searching based on the radius around a place comes out handy. One can search for hospital within the area of maximum 20 km from the place where you are searching. Increasing the radius area would help in getting more results, and also you could find the places which you are familiar with, making things easier when you are in an emergency. There aren’t always the same times when you would not be able to make a call for emergency, and would need to rely on the applications or the internet. The Hospital Finder app could be the best help in such cases. </p>
<p> The Hospital Finder app for Android is available for free in the Android Market. </p>

<p> This app is not that great. You might as well use browser to google it since it uses google data anyway. A better app is US Hospital Finder app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ushospitalfinder&hl=en . It has its own data and have more detail info on each of the hospital. </p>

<p> Housing Android App Review: One of the Best Property Finder Apps </p>
<p> We’ve seen everything. From restaurant finder to a cab service, all on an Android smartphone. But, there are some areas where we might be missing out of information available in the wild, and the reason for that is, these are such sectors which we might not indulge into, in our daily lives. One such is the house renting or buying, as we try and tend to stick to the same sweet home as long as we can. And everyone knows how hard it is to find a right house to shift to, if there is a need. </p>
<p> But recently, there have been some very good apps for smartphones, that have done the job to find a house for rent quite easier. Not limiting itself to renting, there are purchases and sales of houses as well possible through them. One of them, very worthy of a mention, is the Housing App for Android. The company does have a beautiful iOS app as well, but here, we limit the review to the real estate app for Android one that looks the best in interface and does the job one would expect it to do. </p>
<p> Housing Android App Features </p>
<p> To start off, here’s what you can do with the Housing App – </p>
<p> Real estate search: It is not limited to house, but apartments, paying guests and hostels. The search is filtered with several options, which I would be explaining down below, but before that, you get to see the high quality images of each of the listing, price and accurate information and the contact information of either, the broker or the owner of the house. </p>
<p> Search filters based on requirements: Not everyone would want a large house with three bedrooms, right? that is where the filters come to the rescue. The user gets the option to select the number of bedrooms, price range, bathrooms, property type, lease type, furnishing type, date, amenities, and whether you want to see houses with ACs, TVs already available. </p>
<p> Location based finder: The app has a map where you can specify the location, or search with the areas given for the particular city in the beginning of the search itself. The map shows a radius within which all the available houses are shown, and the price / summary is shown there itself, on a single tap. Makes it easier for those who wanted to search for houses close to their workplace. </p>
<p> Shortlist: Finding one, checking it out and finalizing it. Home finding is a relatively harder task. One would probably want to see more than what he has already done, and list out the best choices. The Housing app lets the user shortlist the houses they like, and then let them review and finish the deal. </p>
<p> Digging into the company’s information, we got to know that whatever the data is listed in the application (or their website, no difference), is all genuine, because there is made-up photos sent by the owner or broker, but it is the Housing team that does most of the capturing and approvals. That makes it even more trustworthy, and a companion to find the dream house for renting or purchasing for life. </p>
<p> Using an app against the web version of the same is advantageous, for the reason that while on-the-go, you could simply hit the map and reach the exact house with the estimated directions. And, before getting into our thoughts about the app, we’d say frankly, Housing is indeed one such service that we blindly recommend as a property finder. </p>
<p> Now, a few points about the app that should be helpful for you to understand whether the app is a tidy option. </p>
<p> Housing Android App Review </p>
<p> The interface is simple, neat and clean. This isn’t obviously a third party classified service, but a client system linking both the parties. So, no ads and no fuss. As soon as you open the app, you are asked about the requirement directly. </p>
<p> The way the Housing app showed the filters, deep but important ones such as availability of AC, TV, Cupboards and Beds along with the flat and society amenities (including gas pipeline, parking, lift, refrigerator) is something very important for someone shifting to a new city, and looking for no such issues about buying new ones and roaming around to sell the old ones, or all in all, moving the entire goods. We’ve locally seen several people asking for flats for sale in Bangalore, and not each of them might be shifting their old goods to the new place. And that is the reason, knowing about furnishing is important. </p>
<p> The data is accurate, and each listing has a gallery of photos about the property (house, apartment or any other) with information about the number of rooms, furnishing and the amenities. There is no hidden information, whether you are going deal with the owner directly, or a broker. The other way, you don’t have to work hard to put your house for sale or rent when the need arises. The app has a direct option of listing the house, and that would be later verified before going live. </p>
<p> Finally, Housing Android app is one such credible and reliable app you should have in your smartphone, if you are a student, job seeker or someone who hops around every few months. You don’t really need to roam around on streets to find the available spaces, when you are getting it on your smartphone’s screen. Isn’t it? </p>

<p> How to Access New Android Market Place in India </p>
<p> Seems like Google is on an update spree as in the latest Google said that it will be rolling out the new and improved Android Market Place so that users can now get a streamline experience by which users can access all the information right on the single page itself without having to flip through different tabs for more information. Also this update is termed as a developer friendly update as the refund window period for the users which was 24 hours earlier has now been reduced to mere 15 minutes as most of the users initiate the refund process within minutes of purchasing the application. </p>
<p> Also for developers, the new file size limit has been increased to a new cap of 50 MB, this has mainly increased to encourage developers to design richer games which also indicates a good move with the start of Gingerbread. Also the, on tap support for better device targeting is now embedded to further fine tune the user experience in terms of better displays and densities. </p>
<p> In a recent release, Google said that it will be releasing the new Android market Place within a spread of 2 weeks but you need not wait for that much of time as the curiosity levels might have already raised to a huge level to get the same. So, here it is, you just need to download and install the New Android Market Place apk file from here into your device and there you go you have now got the new Market Place which will be rolled out in the coming weeks. </p>

<p> I wanted to thank you for this great read!!I have been looking for this kind of info on other blogs and none of them went into the details as you did. </p>
<p> Do not enough money to buy a house? Worry not, just because it is real to get the credit loans to work out all the problems. Therefore take a consolidation loan to buy everything you want. </p>
<p> I liked the carousel view in the revised version of Android market but it has got quite slower than the previous market. Still the new market is quite good with the related apps in the app pages. </p>

<p> How to Auto Reply SMS & Calls on Android Phone </p>
<p> Android Applications are helpful ways to make your work easy and this has led to quick popularity of Android. Last time we have explain about app which reads the message automatically and this time we are going with something like auto reply when you can’t answer a phone call or can’t reply to a text message. </p>
<p> At times I find the auto reply (generally called as Vacation ON or Vacation OFF) feature available in Gmail in which whoever sends me mail, they would be quickly notified with the a custom message set by me, that works only when I have Vacation ON turned on in my Gmail settings. I was thinking of something similar on my Android mobile phone in which I am in the middle of interview, I would like my mobile phone not to disturb me and also notify the calling party about the same. This is only possible by setting up custom reply with automatic reply to person whoever calls me or send me message at that particular time. Wait for me was over and I got the Can’t Text Android application installed on my Android device then and there itself. </p>
<p> Can’t Text Android App </p>
<p> Can’t Text is a free Android app which provides a smart way for auto replying needs to text messages and missed calls. With a simple user interface you would be able to auto reply needs. </p>
<p> The interface is very simple and easy looking with three buttons at the bottom makes provisions for the users to activate auto reply for text messages, missed calls or both. Enabling the auto reply for calls will lock the Ringer Volume to Zero for as long as the app is active and if suppose someone calls you or message you they will get the custom message that has messaged you or called you. </p>
<p> Tapping on the current Message text field in the app will bring up the Select Message list and now you can choose from several predefined auto replies. You can also set your own custom message. </p>
<p> The free version of Can’t Text contains text advertisements. There is also availability of ad free paid version of this app which is available in the Android Market for $ 0.99. Download Can’t Text application for Android. </p>

<p> How to Close all Active Apps in Samsung Galaxy S </p>
<p> In Android devices there is still no proper ways to close the applications like option say, Exit or even Cancel so we always need to use some task killers which searches for the applications that runs in background Out of many such applications we will now see about a tool which is called as Advanced Task Killer which is also known as ATK in short. It is one of the most advanced tool to kill applications which generally runs in background without our notice or the apps which we want to close. Use can either use following QR code to download this app for free as given below or you can download the same from the Android Marketplace just by selecting searching Advanced Task killer. Once this application is downloaded and installed, go to the home-screen. </p>
<p> Scan to download </p>
<p> Procedure to kill the applications using Advanced Task Killer: </p>
<p> First you need to Click on Options Button which is located at the left side of your phone and then click on Add button. </p>
<p> As soon as you tap on Add tab, you will have to select Android Widgets from the list of other applications. </p>
<p> Now, after selecting Android Widgets, you will see a list of available widgets, from this list you need to select Advanced Task Killer Free. </p>
<p> Now, you will see the icon of the application which is green colored on your home screen of your device as shown below. </p>
<p> Now whenever you wish to kill or close any running applications in your Samsung Galaxy S phone, all you need to do is go to the main home and all you need to do is to just click on the icon of the Advanced Task Kill Free. Once you click on it you will get a notification of the list of applications which got closed / killed or even which are opened and are working in background and the amount of memory which got freed. As in this example 4 Applications were running in the background which was using the resources of the phone. After clicking on the Task Kill app 4 running applications were closed and also 118 MB of memory was freed (available) from the RAM.. </p>

<p> Just my opinion , This Kind of task killers is not good as you kill the application then later the apps that you killed will run again , Why not use the Running applications method in settings as this one could also end some of backgroud apps .. I Tried this on my Samsung Galaxy Y but nothing happens after i leaved my phone then after they’re back again . Thus this will drain your battery or if you killed a system background it will make your phone unstable such as unknown or weired errors can happen with your phone </p>
<p> hey. i have tried this software n it works only for a few minutes. after that all of the data will run back. how to solve this as my fon consumes a lot of batt because of this problem. thank you. 🙂 </p>
<p> Just in my opinion, as the author of this application. Most of the task managers show what are not necessary. Program monitor has done the right thing to only monitor those that are potentially consuming battery and instead of having user controls what to kill, the program shows you what are necessary to kill and to those who are not savvy enough to decide, the application helps a lot. 🙂 Check it out. </p>

<p> I installed using the recovery mode, now the Cyanogen logo just keeps on recycling. I cleared the cache and guess I will try to reflash… </p>
<p> I installed the CyanodenMod 7 without any problems. I installed it before but the market was not in the rom so I searched it on google and came here. I downloaded the googleapps.zip and installed it from recovery menu. Everything works perfect now 🙂 thank you so much </p>

<p> There seems to be alot guides with simular instructions. My question is ; with wildfire and 2.2.1 plus bootloader of (Hboot-1.01.0001) can this process be done. Some other forums seem to say that due to the bootloader there is nothing that can be done …..yet. Is this true? </p>

<p> Hi! I was thinking about flash my Wildfire or not, but I’m no sure yet. I have a few questions. First of all, HTC have any features like mute phone when you put the phone upside down, is that feature implemented on Cyanogen Roms? Is really Cyanogen Rom faster than original rom? My HTC is running 2.2 with original rom but I don’t know if it’s really faster and better Cyanogen over original. Battery life is longer? Finally, is it possible install original rom and recover warranty? </p>
<p> hey carles, you can go back to original ram whenever required.!! though u can get back into warranty mode once u flash back to og rom! </p>

<p> How to Increase Motorola Xoom Battery Life </p>
<p> So, after rooting your Motorola Xoom and also if you have recently installed the latest version of Ubuntu on your Motorola Xoom then you would like to know on how to increase the battery life for your Motorola Xoom. Though this phone comes with the 25 Wh of battery strength it only lasts for about 336 hours of stand-by time or can last up to a talk time of up to 9 hours on paper or even can last for up to 80 hours if you are playing the music. So, let’s check out the ways with which you can easily save on your battery life which will eventually lead to an increased battery life. </p>
<p> As you all know that the Motorola Xoom comes with an all new Honeycomb 3.0 Android version which is specially optimized for all the tablets which will be rolling out in a full fledged manner in the second half of FY 11. If we look at the history of Android smart phones these are not that much effective and efficient if compared with the battery life of other platforms like Nokia’s native Symbian or even say an Apple’s iOS. </p>
<p> Use Battery Manager Smart Application: </p>
<p> There are so many things and parameters depending on which you will see a fluctuation on the battery performance but since there are many things we will not recommend you to do every single thing which is near to impossible as after all you need to use the Motorola Xoom tablet. </p>
<p> If your Motorola Xoom comes packed with the battery manager which almost comes with almost all Motorola products, to access the same you will have to press the “Menu” key and need to tap on the “Settings” after which you will have to tap on the “Battery manager”. After this now the battery manager will be opening up after which you will see that there are three different modes in the battery saving options which are “Performance Mode”, “Smart Mode” and the “Battery Saver Mode”. </p>
<p> Performance Mode – In the performance mode, the features like data time out as well as the auto brightness functions are turned off so that the battery is saved and the performance is not hindered by these features. Please note that if you haven’t changed the settings before, then this remains the default option for the battery management. </p>
<p> Smart Mode – In the smart mode, basically the things like the data timeout as well as the auto brightness are kept ON with a set of variable settings and also users can define what other parameters </p>
<p> Battery Saver Mode – In the battery saver mode, this one saves the battery to the maximum and which optimizes the battery in such a way that it will maximize the battery performance by reducing the battery use. You can also choose to change the default brightness which is set in this mode by default. </p>
<p> Use applications wisely: </p>
<p> Rather than using all the applications all at once, you can use applications one by one as the applications which are there in the stand by too eats up the battery. Also, in the world of applications in Android many of us tend to use the applications which assist in killing the tasks and application but it’s really not recommended to use such applications like the task killers as since such applications are on and search for the applications which are active, it eats up the battery continuously and instead of reducing the battery usage by closing down the applications it increases the battery usage in whole. Also, if you are using the social networking applications then the frequency of updates should no be set as lower or else it will continously refresh or use the data service for fetching the updates, so choose the manual updation of the updates to save on the battery life. </p>
<p> Turn off the biggest battery drainers </p>
<p> Do you know what are the parameters which constitutes the biggest battery drainers? No, then the biggest battery drainers are GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, Wi Fi and also the 3G. You always have to make sure that these are used very wisely or else these will constantly eat up the battery power which could lead to some serious battery drain. To manage these network settings you can change from HOME > MENU > Settings > Wireless & Networks from where you can easily manage the important settings. </p>
<p> Wall Papers: </p>
<p> Since Motorola Xoom is a 7 inched screen, you need to optimize the wallpaper which you will be setting as lot will depend on this as the wallpaper battery drain constitutes to a whopping 19% of the total battery drain which Xoom encounters with. We would love to see lot of vivid and differentially looking wallpapers on Xoom but sorry to say that with the use of darker as well as the moving wallpapers the battery drain will be at the maximum, so always prefer to set and use lighter looking wallpapers. With the use of lighter wallpapers phone tends to use higher battery life as to make it visible it needs to burn higher pixels which need to be made to glow while the darker screens tends to not to burn the pixels which in turn saves the battery life. So, always use darker wall papers preferably black. Again, by using darker wallpapers you can save on the battery life by a fair amount of percentage which can be as high as 7% on your total battery power. </p>
<p> Use Power Widget </p>
<p> With the use of power widget you can easily save on the battery life easily as all the hot listed things which consume the battery are presented right ast the home screen in the form of widget. You can easily control 5 biggest battery drainers right on a single widget. The 5 things which are available for control in this widget are Wi Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Sync and also the brightness </p>
<p> So, just by following the above tips for the battery saving, you can easily save the battery life by good amount of par and also more importantly you can easily increase the battery performance in the long run. </p>

<p> Just installed it on my galaxy s. It works fine. I just found one issue so far. When you type fastly, it doesn’t all the letter you type in. And thy is quite annoying. Going to look for another better. </p>
<p> Cette application works fine on my Galaxy S, ce keyboard is smaller and more confortable to use. ce only thing that doesn´t work is the haptic feedback, even if the option “vibrate on touch” is enabled. </p>
<p> i tried it on my Tab and it’s WORKING fine. shows support of other languages but doesn’t change letters on keyboard or even when you press them!!! so i guess the languages support is not running. also it occupies a much smaller area on the screen which good but it’s little harder to use and less accurate. good one. </p>

<p> How to Make a Skype Voice Call or Video Call on Android Phones </p>
<p> When you ask any users what do you use for video chat and video calls? The answer will be mostly Skype. The mobile phone has transformed into smartphones with capabilities including as that of any notebooks and PCs. The Skype is now available on Android OS and iOS from Apple. </p>
<p> With Skype on your Android phone you can make free Skype to Skype video calls over 3G or Wi-Fi network. You can also make cheaper calls and SMS to landlines or mobiles at the rates mentioned by Skype. </p>
<p> Supported Android Phones </p>
<p> There is never ending list of supported handsets on Android platform for video calling – </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S, Galaxy S 4G, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, Galaxy S Fascinate, Droid Charge, Samsung Galaxy S II, Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 (WiFi, Verizon, Sprint, Plus), HTC Desire, HTC Desire S, HTC Incredible S, HTC Desire HD, HTC EVO 4G, HTC EVO 3D, HTC Sensation 4G, HTC Thunderbolt, HTC Flyer, Sony Ericsson Xperia NEO, Xperia Pro, Xperia Play, Xperia Ray, Mini Pro, LG Revolution, Motorola Photo, Xoom, Atrix, Acer Iconia Smart and many other mobile phones which supports flash. </p>
<p> Don’t worry if your phone is not listed in the above list, try out going through Android Market and search out for Skype or else you can directly download it from here. We would be going to through installation, setup and using video call feature on Skype from the beginner level user. </p>
<p> Once you have installed this application on your mobile phone you need to tap it to bring it to the front. You would be then prompted to sign into your Skype account, if you have once then do it or else sign up for one. </p>

Once you are done with that, you will be then taken to the Skype main page and you will see four options which are Contacts, Recent, call phone and profile. The “Recent” option shows the recent call history or instant message history of the most recent done things. The “Call Phone” button will take you to the screen where in you can make physical calls and “Profile” option button will let your update your profile and status message. </p>

<p> hOW TO MAKE video call from HTC 826. i searched alot … but couldnt find the video call option. </p>
<p> I would appreciate if anyone can provide me with the steps for video call. </p>
<p> how can I use the front facing camera by video chatting on samsung galaxy ace?or does even samsung galaxy have one? </p>
<p> Thx for the subject But….i know galaxy mini isnt included in video calling devices since it doesnt have a frontal cam but why isnt it possible to see atleast the other sideee???????? How annoying really. </p>
<p> I couldn’t find video call option while using 3G in GALAXY ACE which I have at present. I had to install YAHOO messenger for video calling but this was limited to people having yahoo messenger installed on their device. It is ridiculous to spend so much money and not be able to video call other people on 3G . People using cheaper mobile devices can video call when on 3G but with GLAXY ACE it is simply not possible because it doesn’t have a secondary (front ) camera . Video calling is possible on GALAXY ACE only when both sides have some common application downloaded to their devices. Isn’t it misleading to say that GALAXY ACE is 3G mobile? An 3G device should be able to video call with another mobile number on 3G, which is not possible in case of GALAXY ACE. </p>
<p> Is video calling supported on Samsung Galaxy Mini- S5570 ? Is there any way for video calling in S5570? </p>
<p> Very informative. Please also include the problem of video call on skype on so many android devices. </p>

So, let’s check out how you can do it, we will see on how you can root your Samsung Galaxy S GT I9000 so that you can unlock the potential of your Galaxy S. But before that make sure that rooting actually voids the warranty and is only good for the people who actually know the rooting benefits and also can make use of apps which are only available for the phones which are rooted. But it’s recommended that normal users along with the users whose phone is locked or operator specific don’t perform this rooting process or else your phone may get unstable due to the overwrite of critical system files. Before proceeding to update ensure that you sync all your contacts with your Google Account, all sms, apps, videos and music files which are there in your phone should be taken a backup or else the data will be lost. Anything which is in SD card will not be lost, so you can alternatively move to SD Card. </p>
<p> Pre Requisites: </p>
<p> Make sure that you have installed the latest firmware of XXJVK 2.3.3 on your Galaxy S GT I9000 phone, or else if you continue without that your phone will be bricked as the base file goes missing which XXJVK 2.3.3 acts, </p>

<p> This procedure is not applicable for those who has operator locked phones as warranty voids. </p>
<p> Procedure to root Galaxy S with Android 2.3.3 XXJVK Firmware: </p>
<p> After downloading the above files, you will have to extract CF-Root-XW_OXX_JV1-v1.3-BusyBox-1.17.1_NO-CWM on your computer which you have downloaded so that you get a .tar file which we will be using it in the due course of article. </p>
<p> Now, double click on “Kernel XXJVK” and select the “Extract” option. </p>
<p> Now you will have to switch off the Galaxy S and wait till the phone vibrates which means that phone is completely off now. </p>
<p> Next up you will have to start download mode in Samsung Galaxy S GT I 9000, you need to hold the Volume Down button + the Home key button (the middle button). While holding these both buttons, you need to switch ON your device. </p>
<p> Now in Odin, you need to ensure that the options like “Re Partition” is not checked and keep the options like “Auto Reboot” and “F: Reset Time” boxes as checked and keep rest all of the options as open. </p>
<p> Now, click the PDA tab from the Odin and choose CF-Root-XW_OXX_JV1-v1.3-BusyBox-1.17.1.tar file which is extracted in the above step. </p>
<p> Now, you will have to click on the flash option and will take few minutes for flashing and will preferably take few minutes. </p>
<p> After this you will see that your phone has been rooted and you can check it as the Superuser app will be available in the app drawer section. </p>
<p> After this process, again get into the download mode by following the same procedure so that again you need to flash the XXJVK Kernel which is extracted in the above step. </p>
<p> Now, Open the Odin and connect your phone with the computer and after connecting, simply click on the “Reset” button and you will see that “Added” notification is there in the message box. Make sure that you have unchecked the “Re-Partition” option and kept the tick on “Auto Reboot” as well as on the “F.Reset time” </p>

<p> Dear Neal! </p>
<p> I own Galaxy S GT- I9000 Firmware version 2.3.3 Baseband version I9000JHJV5 Kernel version 2.6.35.7-I9000JHJV8-CL195440 Build number GINGERBREAD.JHJV8 </p>
<p> Neela, I have the same as Stas, from above and tried to root the phone, had to get jtag to get it to work again and the “lab” that did the work entered loads of Orange stuff to the system that I don’t want (phone is not on Orange and never has been)So I really need to root it to get rid of all this junk which is a nuisance. </p>
<p> PPLEEEASE HELP!!! The phone was also 19000T but now the T is gone also. I use pelephone, not Orange so really don’t like the phone opening to orange and having orange GPS, etc,etc. </p>
<p> I followed the steps above to the letter and after the first flash my phone has gone in to a loop of starting and then restarting again. If I try the second flash with the kernel it just sits indefinitely with no activity. I had Gingerbread 2.3.3 before starting. What can I do to fix? </p>
<p> Hi Neil, I am using samsung galaxy s GT I9000 locked on orange, UK. I want to unlock my phone as I am moving to India and want to use my phone on Indian network. I requested orange to provide me with the unlock code which they did. But for some reason I am unable to unlock the phone with the code provided from Orange. I also contact other unlocking code providers on internet and they also provided me with the code (which was similar to that provided by Orange) so cannot unlock my phone. It seems that the unlock code available against the IMEI number of my phone is incorrect. DO you know what the problem is and why the unlock code is not working inspite provided by Orange? any other alternative? </p>
<p> Hello Neal, I have upgraded to gingerbread 2.3.3 successfully and also Rooted using Odin successfully. But now my phone speed is around 950 while when I had Froyo 2.2. with oneclick lagfix it was 1850 on the quadrant benchmark. How can I fix the Lag and speed up my phone while keeping the stable 2.3.3. version? Thanks ! Orlando </p>

<p> I followed your rooting procedure today 12 Sept OS was 2.3.3 The unit will not start up. It will continue to re-boot or it will go into download mode. How can I get it started again? </p>
<p> THIS IS BECAUSE YOU FLASHED THE FIRMWARE ON THE WRONG PHONE! IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ONLY FOR GALAXY S GT I9000. You now need to apply update for Vibrant phone! is your phone turning on in the download mode? </p>
<p> what are the benefits of doing this to your device? as i have followed the instructions and have seen no difference in my phone. please inform me 🙂 </p>

<p> I rooted my i9000 after updating to 2.3.3 from your previous tutorial. Everything’s fine but it seems my accelerometer isn’t working, hence I can’t go into landscape mode anywhere. It’s not really an issue as such and I can live with it but is there any way to fix this? </p>
<p> Dear Neal Pradeep. As I’ll have to ask you the same question that I asked before updating to 2.3. Will my fone remain unlocked. </p>
<p> If it remains unlocked than I shell give it a try. Thanks </p>
<p> GT-I9000 Orange Unlocked updated to your Gingerbread 2.3.3 </p>
<p> Great! Now it keeps rebooting after media scan, even after removing external SD card. What should I do? </p>

<p> I followed the instructions to the letter. Odin told me fail and my phone had black screen of death. If I was not a developer my phone would have stayed dead. (i was not able to enter download mode nor connect to computer) </p>
<p> to which firmware yur phone was flashed before? Kindly follow the procedure carefully! </p>
<p> hello i did the process last night but the phone is taking self reset again and again. plz urgent response required </p>
<p> Odin is not there in the package I downloaded! It only has a zip file named “CF-Root-XW_OXX_JV1-v1.3-BusyBox-1.17.1_NO-CWM” and a file named “Kernel_XXJVK” (7zip application)! </p>
<p> hi i have rooted my phone with the above procedure . but now i want to unroot it . so haow can i unroot my device back to stock firmware . can i flash it directly with the stock firmware using odin </p>
<p> just update with any of the firmwares and then the phone will be un bricked automatically! </p>
<p> “Hey Guys, you are all awesome and doing and doing a fantastic job. Your instructions are so clear and precise that I now have Gingerbread v2.3.3 XXJVK on my Galaxy S. Now I want to Root It. I have downloaded the files from the Rooting Package successfully. When I double click on the CF-Root-XW_OXX_JV1-v1.3-BusyBox-1.17.1_NO-CWM file and extract, I do not get the tar file that you say I should get, I get another zip file with the ame name as the file I have just extracted. When I double click on that and extract, I get a file called zImage. And I get the same when I extract the Kernal XXJVK file too. What am I doing wrong?” Regards Foz. </p>
<p> I have exactly same problem and can’t find an answer?????? </p>
<p> hi my phone version is 2.3.3. Baseband version-I9000DDJV4 KERNAL VERSION 2.6.35.7-I9000DDJV6-CL198883root@SE-S605#2. BUILD NUMBER-GINGERBREAD.DDJV6 DO I ROOT MY PHONE WITH THIS PROCEDURE? YOU HAVE MENTIONED firmware of XXJVK 2.3.3 IS REQUIRED FOR THIS ROOTING PROCEDURE. </p>

<p> Thanks bro 4 this awesome instructions n want 2 suggest everyone just go with the flow… 🙂 finally rooted sgs i9000 android 2.3.3 xxjvk </p>
<p> Tnx Neal! Would my phone be rooted after the update or do I need to go through another step to root it? If the latter is rooting available for jvp 2.3.4? </p>
<p> I accidentally rooted my 2.3.3 JVO with the instructions above for JVK. Now my phone keeps resetting. I made a dumb mistake. Please help me. How do I go about getting it back to life and also rooting it. </p>
<p> just follow the instructions to update xxjvp 2.3.4 and your issue will be solved! </p>

<p> sorry just reread your above tut ???it is actually for my phone,but still have avg report superuser as an infected item </p>
<p> Hi Neal Ive used your tut for upgrading galaxy s to gingerbread xwjvb and then used this tut to root ,installed avg free on phone and it reports superuser app to be an infected file and wants to uninstall it,I then realised that my phone is actually a galaxy s gt-i9000 and there is a seperate tut for it but not for gingerbread xwjvb,apart from avg reporting virus the phone seems ok ,but i’m worried it may not last any help would be much apreciated </p>

<p> Hey vicky sorry for the delay jn replying. you can flash with xwjvb 2.3.3 again by goin into download mode…. </p>
<p> Hello, anybody else who installed this version has problems with batery? the batery will go to 0% after 8–9 hours.. </p>
<p> Sorry, can you clarify something for me? The 2.3.3 ROM that just came out for the i9000 is XWJVB. However, this guide says it is for XXJVK. Thus, it seems to me that this root is /not/ for the new 2.3.3 ROM. So yeah, can you clarify this for me 😛 Or explain it to me, since obviously I’m not understanding something here. </p>
<p> @Kieran Mitchell XWJVB is a lot more stable than XXJVK! Refer the below link for installing XXJVK </p>
<p> hey iam stuck after i rooted the phone using the above procedure, upto the first stage everything was fine. in the second stage when i again when into download mode for appyling the kernel file Kernel_XXJVK.TAR. </p>
<p> it starts the process and gets stuck after displaying firmware update start, it is stuck on zimage for ages nothing happens pls help </p>
<p> hi Neal, I tried rooting my galaxy captivate with Android 2.3.3 XXJVK Firmware but during the procedure, its screen turned green and the phone never started again. It’s not charging, not getting detected on the pc. Its completely dead 🙁 . what should I do now. Please guide me. Thanks </p>
<p> hey @haroon you were not supposed to update your phone by this methosd as this one was strictly to I9000 users and nt for Captivate, now you need to update the phone’s firmware with any of the ROM! </p>
<p> Does it support the T. Chinese? Also, I have done the upgrade of 2.3.3 and also rooted, but I can not find any lagfix to improve I/O performance, can u pls help me to get it? </p>
<p> hey @harry still there are no lagfixes, once it arrives, will surely update with the same, stay tuned to AndroidAdvices.com </p>
<p> Hi l am having problem with my phone.After l rooted my phone the screen stopped to auto rotating.l wonder if there is anything l could do to solve this.Also the kernel still showing is jv1 even after l went on second stage of istalling jvk kernel as shown above. </p>
<p> I have upgraded to Gingerbread 2.3.3 and also rooted my phone, but I am not able to find any lagfix for Gingerbread 2.3.3, can u please tell me where do I find that? </p>
<p> Hi Neal, Can you please tell me what is this rooting means? And its benefits? Once I root my SGS 2.3.3 XXJVK now, whether it will be possible to upgrade this in all future updates? </p>
<p> hi @ajith, rooting is for using the functionalities which is suited for beta testers as well as developers, its not recommended to root as it voids warranty. yes even after rooting you can upgrade the firmwares </p>
<p> After flashing the CF-Root-XW_OXX_JV1-v1.3-BusyBox-1.17.1.tar file twice because after doing it the first time, I did not see the superuser app, I then flashed again. After flashing a second time I still did not see the superuser apps in the App draw. Can you please tell me what I may be missing? FYI, I am running Gingerbread 2.3.3. </p>
<p> I’m not sure if saw my last post but please read below. </p>
<p> After I flashed the CF-Root-XW_OXX_JV1-v1.3-BusyBox-1.17.1.tar file I checked to see if the superuser app was in the App draw. I noted that it is not there. I tried flashing a second time and checked again but still the file was not there. Can you please tell me what I may be missing? </p>
<p> @Robert sorry to see that, but may be due to some reason you are unable to root! i hope you cleared the cache and all!! </p>
<p> i sew the guide you publish abuot hot to root the SGS and it seems to be working just fine (Thank you!), SU icone is appear, but where can i find the “root” folder on my SD at the phone ? or should i install something else ? *need to add region\font\lang’ or maybe you have a better idea to do so … </p>
<p> after unpacking file Rooting-Package-by-AndroidAdvices I get the next files: 1. CF-Root-XW_OXX_JV1-v1.3-BusyBox-1.17.1_NO-CWM.ZIP and 2. Kernel_XXJVK.exe After duble click on Kernel.exe I have get the file called 1. Kernel_XXJVK.TAR but I have not the file CF-Root-XW_OXX_JV1-v1.3-BusyBox-1.17.1.tar ! What I need to do ! Your description is not corect ! Or I do anything wrong ? tnx BYE </p>
<p> Everything goes fine until I have to Flash the Kernel. The Download screen goes on forever (more than 2 hour) and seems to get stocked, then I turn off the phone and its getting bricked. </p>
<p> Can I eventually drop to flash the Kernel? What can I do? </p>
<p> Followed the guide for my Galaxy S. Gingerbread 2.3.3 ROM from samfirmware.com. </p>
<p> After the first Flash the phone was rooted (could start Titanium Backup Pro), after the second flash the phone was NOT (TB fails to get root). </p>
<p> @martin you can reflash again your device with the same by following the procedure here at androidadvices.com </p>
<p> Update on my last comment: phone WAS rooted, only busybox was missing. After installing it from TB the app works. </p>
<p> I was able to correct the problem I previously had. Now though, after flashing the first Tar file and checking to see if the superuser apps is in the App draw I note that it is not there. What am I missing? </p>
<p> I made the mistake of have the box next to PDA checked and then hit start. Nothing seems to be happening. Have I caused a problem by doing so? </p>
<p> @Riobert you can re follow the instructions if your phone is not flashed successfully. </p>
<p> Followed above guide, and after hanging first time (why does it always do that) and restarting went in nicely. Phone runs vey well best since I brought it in 2010. Upgraded to Froyo and now Gingerbread. </p>
<p> Re-installing lost apps. Always good to clean out stuff not used. </p>
<p> However phone was rooted and now is not. Do you have procedeure for rooting a Galaxy S running Gingerbread. </p>
<p> Hi! I installed JVK yesterday, straight from samfirmware.com and using ODIN. Perfect! I then started re-installing my old apps, since I lost everything. </p>
<p> Question: If i follow the procedure you described above to root my SGS JVK 2.3.3, will i loose everything I installed and configured so far? (rookie question, I know. :)) </p>
<p> The question about the kernel above.. Answered./ figured it out.. great tutorials by the way they work as described. Perfect. thank you again now rooted. </p>
<p> Hi last question. Sorry about all the questions. Ok so I have a question with this last step </p>
<p> you need to flash the XXJVK Kernel which is extracted in the above step. </p>
<p> Question> do i just do the same thing exactly over with the same PDA file as i just flased in the step above ?. or do I have to click on another button like phone or csc and then click start. Sorry I did not really understand I have to flash the kernel.. So do I now select the kernel file and put it in the PDA box on Oden.. sorry really confusing.. </p>

<p> Now, you will have to click on the flash option and will take few minutes for flashing and will preferably take few minutes. </p>
<p> I do not SEE the FLASH OPTION.. does this mean click start.. or is there a menu somewhere that i did not see. thank you for anyones time to answer my silly question. </p>
<p> Right now i am rooting my galaxys with gingerbread2.3.3, but after starting the flashing, the phone screen if off,but still showing the IDCOM in odin in yellow colour. </p>
<p> @Praveen it doesn’t take more than 5 minutes and which is the maximum time! try restarting the phone and computer! </p>
<p> Dear Neal, I own a SGS GT-I9000 which I bough in the KSA and have been using without any problem. But when I wanted to use it in India with IDEA or VODAFONE sim cards, it gives only ’emergency call’ facility. I could use an IDEA sim about 15 days which is almost 2 years old. But later it also stopped working and gives only emergency call in the same way a newly bought sim card does. All these sim cards work in other phones including another model of Samsung! </p>
<p> Finally I bought an Airtel sim card, which works without any problem. I do not know what causes my SGS to act like this. Could you advise me to get rid of this problem. The phone details are here: Model number: GT-I9000 Firmware version: 2.2.1 Baseband version:I9000JXJPF Kernel version: 2.6.32.9 root@SE-S606#30 Build number: FROYO.JPJPM —————————————- If I enter *#1234#, I get the response: PDA: I9000JPJPM PHONE: I9000JXJPF CSC: I9000 OJPJPL Buil Info: 2011.02 </p>
<p> have you tried updating with any firmware like XXJVR, as of now i feel that your device is network locked and the same needs to be unlocked first! </p>
<p> Dear Neal, No, I haven’t tried any update. How could it be network locked when I could use it in the KSA with three Serivice Providers like STC, Mobily and Zain and in India with Airtel and ,of course, with ‘Idea’ for a shortwhile before it started giving only ’emergency call’?! If it is network locked, how can it be unlocked, Mr.Neal? By the way, what is the best firmware version fo my phone to be updated? </p>
<p> Thank you very much for your consideration, Mahmud Koya. </p>
<p> best firmware is XXJVS 2.3.5 as of now for your Galaxy S GT I9000 </p>
<p> Mahmud Koya </p>
<p> September 14, 2011 at 1:58 pm </p>
<p> Hi Neal, I want to update my SGS GT-I9000. What is the best firmware version for my phone.The phone details are here: Model number: GT-I9000 Firmware version: 2.2.1 Baseband version:I9000JXJPF Kernel version: 2.6.32.9 root@SE-S606#30 Build number: FROYO.JPJPM —————————————- If I enter *#1234#, I get the response: PDA: I9000JPJPM PHONE: I9000JXJPF CSC: I9000 OJPJPL Buil Info: 2011.02 </p>
<p> yes, you can update with the latest version of Gingerbread 2.3.5 XXJVS! </p>
<p> Mahmud Koya </p>
<p> September 17, 2011 at 1:05 am </p>
<p> Hi Neal, I successfully updated my SGS i9000 with the the latest version of Gingerbread 2.3.5 XXJVS as you advised and rooted as well. After the update, I think the WIFI signal reception reduced, but the browsing and downloading speed is not affected. I mean, the previous networks showed four or three signal bars, now show two or one only. Is it common to all or should I do something more to my phone? </p>
<p> WE WILL BE UPDATING THE FIX WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS, STAY TUNED! </p>
<p> Mahmud Koya </p>
<p> September 20, 2011 at 12:12 am </p>
<p> Hi Neal, Where can I find the WIFI fix for the XXJVS which you said yesterday would be available in next 24 hours? </p>
<p> Hi Neal, Can the Voodoo Lag fix be applied on (R00TED) SGS GT-I9000 with XXJVS 2.3.5? </p>
<p> Is the Voodoo Lag fix for the (R00TED) SGS GT-I9000 with XXJVS 2.3.5 available or not? </p>

<p> How to Root HTC Aria Android Phone </p>
<p> If you are owning an HTC Aria then you would love to make the most out of it. So, the first step to make the most out of it will be only possible when you root this device. Not to worry we will guide you on how to root your HTC Aria very easily with a simple to understand tutorial which is mentioned below. its highly advisable to create a backup of all data before proceeding to the rooting of HTC Aria as in an unlikely event you may loose data. Also, please ensure that battery is fully charged before proceeding to root your HTC Aria and also rooting voids the warranty but there are methods with which you can un root your device and can make it like before as rooting as its own set of advantages and its very beneficial at times. So, let’s proceed for the procedure to root HTC Aria. </p>
<p> Procedure to Root HTC Aria: </p>
<p> First you need to visit the un revoked website and then you need to download this software for Windows, Mac or for Linux on your computer. </p>
<p> Now, if you are on Windows, then you will have to configure the HBoot Driver. You will have to download the modified USB Driver and need to unzip of desktop after which if you are on Windows then follow the below procedure or skip to next step. </p>
<p> After this just turn off your phone and then boot the device in the HBOOT menu by holding power and volume down. </p>
<p> In the options, you will have to choose “HBOOT USB” by pressing the volume down key after which you will have to wait for some time till the process gets completed. </p>
<p> Now, as soon as the process gets finished, you will have to connect your phone with the USB cable and then you will have to wait for the phone to display HBOOT USB PLUG on screen. </p>
<p> After this, you will have to open the device manager and click on the “Start”, then right click on the “Computer”, click on properties and then click on Device manager. Now here in the “Other devices”, you will see “Android1.0” device which is as shown below: </p>
<p> Now, you will have to right click on “Android 1.0” and click “Update Driver Software”, after which you will be getting the screen as shown below. </p>
<p> Now as shown in the above screen shot, click on the second option “Browse my computer for driver software” </p>
<p> Now, Click on Browse and simply select the Android USB Driver folder on on your computer which you have downloaded in the earlier step, click ok and then click on Next. After this you will be getting the status bar which indicates that the driver is installing.Just click on OK if there are any warnings.After installing the driver successfully, the screen will look like this as mentioned below: </p>
<p> Now, just simply click on “Close” and make sure “Android Bootloader Interfaceis” listed under Android Phone as shown below, </p>
<p> Now, after this connect your HTC Aria & run the unrevoked software which you have downloaded for your OS in the first step. Please note that this process takes a minute or two and in the end HTC Aria should boot into the ClockworkMod Recovery mode. </p>
<p> That’s it after competion of the process, HTC Aria will now have the SU access and ClockworkMod Recovery will be installed in place of normal stock recovery. </p>
<p> When I follow the procedure I get an error saying “Error: failed to get root. Is your firmware too new?” Can someone help me with this. I desperately need to root my Htc Wildfire. </p>
<p> What is the password for the driver stuff, because this tutorial can’t be used anymore because someone putted a password on the zip >_<" </p>
<p> I downloaded the modified usb driver, through there doesn’t seem to be any installation file. </p>
<p> When I Hbooted my phone and plugged it in to the usb port I do not get the message “HBOOT USB PLUG” </p>
<p> I also cannot find other devices where you said it should be. What am I doing wrong. Please email me. Thanx </p>
<p> check with the path where you placed the file as HBOOT is unable to find that file! </p>
<p> I’ve tried rooting my Aria (updated to 2.2 Froyo) using this method and keep getting the message </p>
<p> “Error: Failed to get root. Is your firmware too new?” </p>
<p> I have bought htc wildfire three months back……..and updated it to 2.2 froyo……but it is very slow…. and the battery life is also not up to the mark………..I don hv any idea abt rooting a phone…..but i wan t to root my wildfire……which ROM i sd best one?? </p>
<p> After rooting will i be able to get back my default htc’s rom and ui if at all i m nt satisfied wid custom rom??? </p>
<p> hi @amrit, sorry to hear that you are facing your issues with the current ROM, i would like to tell you that rooting is a different thing and flashing is a different thing. Rooting just opens up your device so that you can customize the device whereas with flashing you can update or add a new rom to your device. we have noted your request and soon will come out with a solution for you. Till then stay tuned to androidadvices </p>
<p> hmm thanks, i just want to install another ROM to save battery, the battery drain so fast or do u have any tip ? help me </p>
<p> yes justin there is no need for rooting if you will not be using hard core apps which require you to root your device so as to get the root access. </p>

<p> How To Root HTC Thunderbold & Unlock Bootloader </p>
<p> For all those who have recently bought in the latest htc thunderbolt here’s a great news for all you people as we have caught on with the trick on how you can easily root thunderbolt and also unlock with the help of boot loader. Though there are advantages as well as the disadvantages of rooting the devices of which the advantages range from accessing the root folder which in other case can’t be accessed, ability to downgrade and flash any of the firm wares as per your likings and versions it also comes with the disadvantages of no custom recovery or the custom kernels and also flashing with the beta leaks of the firm wares it could potentially lead to non working of some applications in the phone which can be serious at times and also it needs a thorough knowledge in getting back the device to life if the wrong or any other firmware is flashed. </p>
<p> So, before proceeding for upgrading the device, you will have to note that you will be losing all the data including all the applications, SMS, contacts and other data which is there in the device. Also make sure that you need to backup all the things which you will be losing them so that you can easily restore the apps and other things. So, let’s proceed and see on how you can easily root and unlock the htc thunderbolt via boot loader but before that you will have to download the below mentioned files. </p>
<p> Please note that you will have to root the device with the help of adb and also you need to ensure that </p>
<p> adb push psneuter /data/local/ </p>
<p> adb push busybox /data/local/ </p>
<p> adb shell chmod 777 /data/local/psneuter </p>
<p> adb shell chmod 777 /data/local/busybox </p>
<p> Now, all you need to do is to just simply unzip the su.zip and push the same to the root of the /sdcard by the below mentioned command </p>
<p> adb push su /sdcard/su </p>
<p> Now you will have to just unzip the misc.zip to your sd card and then after this you will have to gain the temporary root and flash the custom misc.img by doing the following command. </p>
<p> adb shell </p>
<p> Now the shell should display “$” </p>
<p> Run: </p>
<p> /data/local/psneuter </p>
<p> You will now be kicked out of adb, and adb will restart as root. Let’s confirm the md5 of misc.img: </p>
<p> adb shell </p>
<p> At this point, the shell should display “#” </p>
<p> Run: </p>
<p> /data/local/busybox md5sum /sdcard/misc.img </p>
<p> Output should be c88dd947eb3b36eec90503a3525ae0de. If it’s anything else, you just need. </p>
<p> Now let’s write misc.img: </p>
<p> dd if=/sdcard/misc.img of=/dev/block/mmcblk0p17 </p>
<p> exit </p>
<p> Next up your device should now be booting into the boot loader and checking the image. Once this flashes and you are rebooted, write protection to /system has been disabled. Please repeat step 2 and get psnueter and busybox back on your phone. Now delete PG05IMG.zip off your sdcard. After that, make sure to re-enable USB debugging and installing from unknown sources. </p>
<p> Now, you will have to rename ruu as PG05IMG.zip and this you need to place it on your sdcard and then you will have to flash it: </p>

Though there are many advantages of rooting, the only disadvantage being till now is that the warranty is voided as soon as you root the device, though the warranty can be claimed back once you un root the device. After rooting the device you can get the administrator access after which right from changing the file system to removing the factory loaded apps can be enjoyed to name the few benefits. </p>
<p> There are two ways with which you can root your Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 Mini, one is by using the Z4 Root and other one is by using the Super One click root. Both of these ways are very effective in rooting the device but some of the users have faced and reported some issues about rooting with the help of Z4 Root about device not being rooted successfully while for all those who wanted to simply root their phones temporarily or even permanently Z4 Root is a good option. </p>
<p> Make sure that you backup all your applications, messages and also all your songs, images, videos and contacts as in the process of rooting you may lose all of this information, though it’s an unlikely event that you lose everything. So, it’s highly recommended to either sync all your data or create the backup of all your data so that you can restore the same after rooting or after the firmware update. So, let’s proceed and see on how to root your phone by two simple ways that is by using the Z4 Root as well as by using the Super One click Root. </p>
<p> It’s very important to maintain a minimum battery power of 50% so as to facilitate the smoother rooting process or else there is a high possibility that your device may end up turning completely off in the process of rooting. Since the process of rooting will be taking place, all the APN settings with which you access the Internet will be wiped off completely, so ensure that you have noted all the required settings for accessing the internet so that you can configure them again back once the device gets rooted. </p>
<p> Procedure to Root Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 Mini using Z4 Root: </p>
<p> First of all you will have to download the application called z4root from here on your computer and then you will have to unzip the same to get the .apk file which can be then copied on your android phone easily. While unzipping the file if the password is prompted then you need to enter the password as “androidadvices.com”. Please note that only after extraction you will get the apk file which you will have to copy the same in your Sony Xperia X10 Mini. </p>
<p> Now, as soon as you copy the Z4Root’s apk file in your phone, you need to go to the application list and just need to tap on the same to install it on your Sony Xperia X10 Mini. </p>
<p> Now, as soon as the installation of Z4 Root is completed, you will have to tap on the application to open the same after which you will see two options that is temporary root and another one will be the Permanent Root. From this, you will have to tap on the “Permanent Root” after which the device will be rooted in seconds. Do, note that while the process is running don’t interrupt its processes or else you will have to repeat the rooting process, and also its not recommended to choose the temporary root as if you do the temporary root then the device will get un rooted just by a simple restart. </p>
<p> After selecting the appropriate option among the two, the rooting process will be finished and then you will see that the device will be restarting. If you are choosing the temporary root then the device will only stay rooted till the device is restarted as soon as you restart your phone the device will be un rooted. So, it’s always recommended to select the Permanent Root. So, after the phone is restarted you will see that you will see that a new icon of “Superuser” will be created in the screen which will be in the shape of skull. This means your device has been successfully rooted and you are ready to customize the device the way you want it. Do, let us know if you face any problems while rooting your device. </p>

Not to forget with its unique simple interface, you will never have to go through serious rooting capabilities like HRoot and etc. etc. which sometimes is very difficult to perform at times as a normal user. </p>
<p> Please note that before proceeding you will have to first install the Java SDK, not just Runtime but the full SDK which you can download from here which supports framework required to run the Android SDK. The main reason to install this SDK is that to root the device the computer will be requiring the drivers so that you can easily root the phone using the Super One click. </p>

<p> HI </p>
<p> It did not work for me. I have a samsung S4 and tried to used the same settings from s3 and got an error saying that could not verify server. I can send email but not receive with settings: incoming : </p>
<p> Dude…thanks so much. About last week, my yahoo email account on my Nexus 4 started giving me a bad username or password message, although I was accessing it fine the week prior without having to use the Yahoo application (i,.e., I was able to have my Nexus 4 automatically set it up by simply entering my yahoo email address and password during the email configuration), so I’m fairly certain yahoo changed something on their end. Anyway, long story short, I simply went into the manula email configuration and changed the incoming server address to imap.mail.yahoo.com (instead of what was already there, which was imap.yahoo.com) and changed the incoming port to 993 (instead of the erroneous port # that was there…forgot what it was), and now it syncs perfectly. SO THANKS so much for including those advanced instructions! 😉 </p>
<p> recently yahoo email server certificate expired and my android devices failed to authenticate. </p>
<p> I don’t even know how I ended up here, but I believed this publish was once great. I do not realize who you might be but certainly you’re going to a well-known blogger when you are not already. Cheers! </p>
<p> Good explanation. Please advise if you know how to setup yahoo bizmail on android 2.3.5 Samsung Galaxy S2. It was working before upgrade(gingerbread 2.3.3). I need to send email with my bizmail address not yahoo address </p>
<p> Thanks! I had to dump the Yahoo Mail app because it was killing the battery on my SGS2. Happy to find out I don’t need the app to get my mail 🙂 </p>
<p> I downloaded the app and it works fine, but I’d like to fine-tune the settings and can’t figure that out. Can I set it to 1. only check mail when I ask for it 2. only download new mail, not everything in my account? </p>
<p> It worked!!! after several tries. I upgrade my yahoo email to the latest version and tried while my email acct was open on my computer and then it finally worked. I guess was a combination of all. Thanks! </p>
<p> Brilliant…Many thanks…!!!…Made life easy, the reason why I bought my Galaxy tab…But it was near annoying untill, I read this …How to set up…!!! </p>
<p> Worked perfectly on my Asus Eee Pad Transformer. Please note that I failed to setup Yahoo mail using POP3. So IMAP is the way to go for it. </p>
<p> thank you so much. i was about to discard my android because i cant access my much needed yahoo mail from it. thank you once again </p>
<p> You’ve wonderfully written the post. I’ve liked your way of penning this. Thanks for sharing this. </p>

<p> How To Transfer your Files & Pictures on NFC Enabled Android Phones </p>
<p> Most of you by now would be aware of NFC (Near Field Communication) technology used to communicate or transfer files in short distance. This technology is expected to become widely accepted mode of file transfer and payment option. </p>
<p> The Android doesn’t get back of this and they have the File Expert application available for free download to provide NFC communication between the two NFC enabled smartphones. The File Expert app will use the NFC technology to transfer files from one NFC enabled device to another one. Technically in NFC, files are sent without any connection and so it doesn’t require device searching and pairing process and its complete zero configuration solution for transferring files and folders. But there are certain limitations of this technology as its still under development and better results can be expected in near future, this technology works for devices which are located in lesser distance say 1cms to 4 cms and the data transfer rate is very very slow. Infact you can call Infra Red way better than this, but why NFC technology is in much talk and craze? As I said you, going in the future this will certainly improve. </p>
<p> Transfer your Files & Pictures Between Two Android Phones using NFC Concept </p>
<p> Using the File Expert application for transferring files, importantly it should be installed on both of the phones not necessarily be Android phone. Once you are installed that you are ready to send files and open file on one phone and send to other. File Expert is an amazing file manager apps supporting various options like Wi-Fi sharing, SMB sharing and other sharing options. This apps not necessarily require to have NFC enabled device and can be setup on any phone, however NFC enabling adds extra advantages. </p>
<p> This tutorial will show you on how to transfer files between the two Android smart phones using the File Expert. Complete process step by step is mentioned here. </p>
<p> First of all you need to download the apps called File Expert, install it on both the phones. </p>
<p> Now as you know File Expert had various options of sharing files between two devices. It has Wi-Fi sharing, SMB sharing, FTP sharing and Bluetooth sharing. </p>
<p> Now navigate to the folder which you want to send from the File Expert navigation and send the files accordingly to your requirements. Please make sure that the other phone should be located in the near vicinity. </p>
<p> File Expert Download </p>

<p> I think the author had some misunderstanding here. Nfc nowadays refers to the tap-enabling data transfer. U dun need any app to do it, the transfer starts right after one device touches the other. </p>
<p> For heavens sake where is the tutorial Mr Patel is talking about in this post. I cannot see a step by step direction on how to do it. Am I missing something? </p>
<p> Just download and open the File Expert, you will easily understand that. And the tutorial is just the two steps as mention in the post. </p>

Though there are many notable changes in this Honeycomb 3.1 version, there are many things which are really amazing in this version which we will be seeing in the due course of this article. </p>
<p> Improvements in the Android’s Honeycomb 3.1 </p>
<p> Right from adding the native resizeable widgets which is really very visually appealing to the inclusion of the USB host support which again was a mostly demanded feature, HTML 5 playback without needing to install any third party applications which means that all you need to play a video is just a <video> tag in Android’s native browser. The user interface transitions now feel much more fluidic and also most importantly the Launcher animation is optimized for faster, smoother transition to and from the Apps list. Adjustments in color, positioning, and text make UI elements easier to see, understand, and use this 3.1 version of Honeycomb. Accessibility is improved with consistent audible feedback throughout the UI and a new setting to let users customize the touch-hold interval to meet their needs. </p>
<p> Navigation to and from the five home screens is now easier and also touching the Home button in the system bar now takes you to the home screen most recently used. Additionally the Settings offer an improved view of internal storage, showing the storage used by a larger set of file types. </p>
<p> Connectivity for the USB devices have been now enhanced, as the users can attach many types of input devices (keyboards, mice, game controllers) and digital cameras. </p>
<p> Users will now be able to expand the recent apps list, resize the home screen widgets, can enjoy the benefit of robust Wi Fi networking, all the applications have been updated like the browser app now includes a variety of new features and UI improvements that make viewing web content simpler, faster, and more convenient, quick Controls UI, accessible from Browser Settings, is extended and redesigned. </p>
<p> The Gallery has been redesigned to a very better manner as the Gallery app now supports Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP), so that users can connect their cameras over USB and import their pictures to Gallery with a single touch. The app also copies the pictures to local storage and provides an indicator to let users see how much space is available along with many other numerous developer add-ons. Not to forget the battery life too is increased in Xoom with this update </p>
<p> Note: Next up will be the Pre Upgrade instructions, if you are used to the updating of the device then you may skip those instructions and proceed to the procedure to manually update. </p>
<p> Pre Upgrade instructions </p>
<p> Ensure that you have created a backup of all the applications, messages, contacts, images and also multimedia files along with the call log too as in an unlikely event you may lose all the data after rooting the device. After updating is finished in your device then you can easily restore them back into the device. </p>
<p> Rooting basically voids the warranty, so ensure that you are ready for it and also most importantly proceed to root your device you should know what rooting is and what are its benefits, if you will make use of those then its recommended to go ahead and it’s not recommended for the newbie. </p>
<p> Ensure that your battery is charged with an at least more than 50% as the higher the battery life the lesser will be the problems as this process will require some of the battery as it will drain battery a bit as this is a very important thing which most of the users miss out. </p>
<p> Since the device’s firmware will be updated to the another version, all the APN settings will be cleared, so to access the Internet and to get the MMS you will have to again reconfigure the APN Settings to access the Internet on your Motorola Xoom tablet . </p>
<p> Procedure to manually update Motorola Xoom with the Honeycomb 3.1 version: </p>
<p> First of all you will have to root Motorola Xoom by following the instructions carefully and as mentioned in the article. </p>
<p> After rooting your Motorola Xoom, you will have to ensure that you have ADB Setup in your computer and then proceed to download the Honeycomb 3.1 update for Xoom in your computer. Please note that after downloading in your computer, you rename the same to update.zip and not to update.zip.zip as the Xoom will not recognize the firmware file. </p>
<p> Now, after this with the help of original USB cable which you have got at the time of purchase of Xoom tablet connect the same with your computer and Xoom after which move the update.zip file which you have downloaded from the above link to your Motorola Xoom without renaming the zip file to the “tools” folder which is in the SDK folder in your computer. </p>
<p> Now, as soon as you copy the file, you will now have to start the command prompt and then you will have to run the below mentioned commands as mentioned below, before entering the commands int he adb ensure that you are entering all the commands correctly and not wrongly as this may invite un necessary issues which may or may not be repairable, </p>
<p> adb push update.zip /sdcard/update.zip adb shell su cd /cache mkdir recovery cd recovery echo ‘–update_package=CACHE:/recovery/update.zip’ > command cat /sdcard/update.zip > update.zip reboot recovery </p>

<p> So I take it the file on he download link is not correct? Or do you have to download the USB driver, then change the name to update.zip? I’m not sure what to do know since this is the only place I found on-line to perform a manaul upgrade to my phone. Can someone please clearify this information. Thanks! </p>
<p> I agree with Chad, this is silly. You’re giving information that sounds comprehensive without a working link, even since december 27th when he posted. Good job. </p>
<p> You need to provide a working link at all times. Google has dropped the link and you should have already had it in a zip file on your own servers. Now you are getting 1st page search results for something you cannot produce. Nice, real nice. </p>

<p> Ps it did say I wouldnt be able to make calls or emergency calls also. </p>
<p> hello guys.. my cell phone doesnt switch on now! what to do? its sony ericson experia arc..it was hung yesterday so i thought i should switch it off and than on..but it doenst proceed to get on! what should i do? </p>
<p> I Already have an unlocked boot loader, can i directly Update my Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc to Gingerbread 2.3.3 Firmware or i need to unlock the boot loader using your instructions for that </p>
<p> my Xperia arc LT15i update failed… use PC companion step by step to update, 1.start. 2.prepare.(update failed) what happed? </p>
<p> Heyy first you say “Kindly note that by doing this process you will not be voiding the warranty” Yet you say you have to root the device first which will void the warrenty anyway. </p>
<p> Then you say “and also if you have earlier rooted your Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc before then after the firmware update the root access will be revoked and then again you will have to root the device” </p>
<p> I thought rooting was permanent and couldn’t be unrooted or am I getting you wrong </p>
<p> Hmmm – surely it is simpler to just use Sony Ericsson Update Service or there PC Companion. You should make it clear that you do not have to unlock the bootloader in your article, and that there are consequences to doing this. </p>

<p> Has Samsung has made a change to quick connect on the S6 so it works ONEY if you use their music app? On the Samsung Galaxy s6 open Samsung’s music app, start playing a song, then swipe down from the top and tap on “Quick Connect”, my DNLA receiver is displayed and I am able to play my music through this device. HOWEVER if I close the Samsung music app, open the google music app and follow the same steps as above “Quick Connect” has now suddenly lost its ability to locate or connect to my DNLA device. Is anyone else experiencing the same issue? </p>

<p> HTC 11 with Snapdragon 835 SoC, 6GB RAM, & 128GB Storage Leaked </p>
<p> With the HTC 10 launch, HTC removed the word ‘One’ from its flagship series. While the HTC 10 is not a bad device, the company hasn’t been successful in creating much hype that resulted in the poor sales. The company has been seeing losses for quite a few years, and nothing had changed in 2016. However, after the making the Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, we can at least expect something better from the upcoming flagship, HTC 11. There are few leaks about the device, but they aren’t officially confirmed. Today, we got a new leak from China revealing the important specifications. Before talking further about them in details, take the specifications with a pinch of salt as there is no legit source. </p>
<p> The device is said to run on the latest Android 7.1.2 Nougat out of the box with the customized Sense 9.0 UI laid on top. The Beta update of the Android 7.1.2 Nougat OS was recently released and is only limited to the Google’s Pixel and Nexus smartphones. Though HTC and Google are having a close relationship, we don’t think the company will get the early access to the latest OS which is just made available for the Google’s own devices. It even comes with HTC Sense 9 UI which we never heard off. Coming to the hardware specifications, the device is mentioned to come with recently announced Snapdragon 835 octa-core processor. It is built by Qualcomm using the Samsung’s 10nm FinFET process. </p>
<p> Apart from HTC, the upcoming flagship smartphones from most of the other brands will also use the Snapdragon 835 SoC. The exact availability date of this new processor is not yet known and launch of the smartphones using is also unknown. Few rumors suggests Samsung will be the first manufacturer to use this new flagship processor. While the Galaxy S8 devices are expected to launch at the MWC 2017 event, the company has unofficially confirmed to launch only the Galaxy Tab S3 at the event. The Galaxy Unpacked event is rumored to be postponed to April and all the other flagship launches might also get affected by this delay. As of now, there is no approximate launch date from HTC for the launch of HTC 11. </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 835 SoC on this device will be accompanied by 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. Last year, even Samsung launched its first ever 6GB RAM smartphone, Galaxy C9 Pro. During the recently concluded CES 2017, ASUS came with the Zenfone AR smartphone featuring 8GB RAM which most of the laptops doesn’t include. While the screen size fo the device is not known, it is mentioned to come with 1556 x 2550 pixels resolution. On the other hand, the upcoming LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8 will too feature displays with an odd resolution of 2880 x 1440 pixels. As we said above, we don’t think the upcoming device to surely come with these exact specifications. Even, we can’t confirm the upcoming HTC flagship will be called as HTC 11.

<p> HTC Desire Phone Codenamed ‘HTC A50C’ is Coming to China </p>
<p> HTC has launched number of high-end devices this year, the list started with One M9 and followed by One E9, One M9+, One E9+ and few others. There are rumours that HTC will be launching another high-end device HTC Hima Ace aka One ME9 in the next month. Now, HTC is getting ready to launch a mid-range Desire series smartphone with model number ‘HTC A50C’ as quoted Upleaks. </p>
<p> The upcoming Desire smartphones will sport a 5.5-inch HD (1280×720) display and will be powered by a Mediatek MT6753T octa-core processor. The clock speed of the processor is unknown. It comes with 2GB of RAM along with 16GB of internal storage and supports Dual SIM connectivity. </p>
<p> There is a 13MP rear camera with Samsung S5K3L2XX sensor and 5MP front-facing camera with Samsung S5K5E2YA sensor. The device runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop based HTC Sense 7.0 UI. The phones will be available in white, black, red, orange, blue, grey, gold and other seven colours. There is no information about any other specifications and even the price or the availability of the device is also unknown. </p>
<p> Later to this, the HTC A50A is renamed to HTC E9sw. By comparing with that, this also may be the low-cost version of HTC E9. We can also expect it to be the HTC 826S. With the Dual SIM compatibility, we are sure that the device will not leave Asia. HTC might get better than expected results if it priced aggressively. The Desire series had given better results in India with the launch of Desire 816 and Desire 816G smartphones. </p>
<p> A couple of months HTC back launched the HTC Desire 820S which is the successor the Desire 820. It almost has the same specifications as of HTC A50C, but with a better processor. The HTC A50C is expected to be priced at 1,999 Yuan (approx Rs. 20,500). As TENNA already certified it, we may see the launch of the device soon in China. We will update once there is any information about the availability and the launch of the device. </p>

<p> HTC Butterfly 2 Spotted at the Taiwanese NCC – Rumored Specs & Details </p>
<p> HTC Butterfly 2 is the new device from HTC that has been spotted on Taiwanese NCC that is equal to the FCC of USA. The device will be the successor of the HTC Butterfly that was released early last year. The HTC One M8 did not give the amount of success that the company was expecting but the cheaper variant of this flagship device called as the HTC One E8 has satisfied quite a number of customers, because it’s the plastic version of the HTC One M8 with a low price. </p>
<p> The phone carries the model number B810x and is expected to be launched in Asia soon. There was a rumor that the Butterfly series was discontinued by the company but that’s not the case now. The HTC Butterfly was the world’s first device with 1080p display and had high end specs considering its release time so we can expect its successor also to come packed with some decent and powerful specifications. </p>
<p> According to the rumors the Butterfly 2 will feature a quad core Snapdragon 400 chipset, Krait 400 CPU and will flaunt a 5 inch display with 1080p resolutions. Other details of the device are not yet know but can assure that it will be supporting 4G LTE networks. From the leaked images we can clearly see that the device will be coming in multiple colours like Black, White, Silver, Brown and Red so that everyone has their choice of choosing the colour. The images also reveal that this device will be featuring capacitive touch buttons, just below the screen and the back button is at the left and home screen at the right of the device. Coming to the design, it has curved edges as most of the HTC devices have. </p>
<p> We need to wait some official news to come from the company to more about this device and that should be happening in the coming days. The pricing and the availability of the device is not known yet since it has not been shown officially yet. </p>

<p> HTC Desire 516 Smartphone Review </p>
<p> It is the much-needed mid-range smartphone for HTC, which company should have made a long time ago. We take a look at the phone’s finer features and see if it matches up with devices like Moto G 2014 and Zenfone 5. Here are our thoughts on the device. </p>
<p> Design </p>
<p> First let’s talk about the design. The device has nice rounded edges and a glossy plastic back cover. With thin bezels, HTC made a slightly easy to hold 5-inch smartphone. Meaning, it is easy to use this smartphone on one hand as you can move the thumb around the corners of the device. Though, with its bulky look and plastic body it is not the best design of HTC. </p>
<p> At the front of the device, there is an earpiece, front camera and some sensors installed by company. While at the bottom, there are capacitive button for back, home and menu operations. On the right edge, you will find the power button while the volume rocker keys are given on the left edge. At the bottom edge, there is a primary microphone, while audio jack and microUSB port are present at the top edge. </p>
<p> Display </p>
<p> Next up is a display on Desire 516. The device comes with a 5-inch display with 960×540 resolutions, which makes it a 220 PPI display. While its competitors like Redmi 1S is offering a 720p display under INR 6,000 pricing. It is pretty hard for HTC to convince its consumers why they should buy this handset. Well, I wouldn’t go for it at this pricing. With a resolution lower than 720p, you cannot expect a device to offer good viewing angles under daylight. It would have been a good catch if HTC had made this a budget smartphone, rather taking it to the mid-range pricing. </p>
<p> Hardware/Performance </p>
<p> Coming to the hardware and performance on Desire 516, it is powered by a Quad-core Snapdragon 200. It is the same processor that is found on the Moto E, apparently. It is complimented by Adreno 302 and 1GB of RAM. The device comes with a 4GB of internal storage and out of which less than 2GB of storage space is available to use. There is an expansion slot, which supports microSD card of up to 32GB. With these average specs, the device does hold up to your daily routine tasks. With battery rating of 1950mAh, the device easily provides a day’s of charge. </p>
<p> Software </p>
<p> As far as the software goes, the HTC Desire 516 is running Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. It is layered with HTC Sense UI, which is the most elegant interface. Though, here we found the older Sense 5.1, which fall slightly behind in the overall experience. But nonetheless, the UI performs pretty smooth, making it a decent experience, if not the best. You also get the BlinkFeed option on the home screen, which is quite a good magazine that can be customized easily. </p>
<p> Camera </p>
<p> Talking about the camera on the Desire 516. It comes with a 5MP rear shooter with LED flashlight. The company mentioned it could shoot 1080p videos while it was not the case when we tested the camera. It can shoot as higher as 720p only. The photos were decent for a 5MP module, but with brands like HTC, we expect more. Of course, the low-light images were not that good with a low ISO, as the details were not visible in the photos. The front-facing snapper was pretty bad because the photos were blurry even when the camera module was sitting tight. It is not the type of quality one expects from a big brand like HTC. </p>
<p> Cons </p>
<p> The device is priced at a stretched price of INR 13,000, considering the specs it comes with. There would have been any flaw if this were priced under budget range. The internal memory is very low for a device this much priced. If we keep the pricing aside for a sec, then, there is still no chance that we would recommend this device. As a design, build quality and Android OS on Desire 516 is far older than the current state of the mobile industry. </p>
<p> Verdict </p>
<p> The only thing to like about this device is its good battery performance. With just 1950mAh power, the device easily manages to have a few hours of battery juice left, even after a whole day use. While the Sense UI was pretty smooth on Desire 516, the Android OS was old. It could have been a better device if few of the specs were ramped up. </p>

<p> HTC Desire 516 with 5-inch Display, Quad-core Processor, 2 Variants – Leaked Specs & Photos </p>
<p> After the HTC Desire 816 appeared, another device in the Desire series emerged online and Phonearena got to capture a few photos of this new device, the HTC Desire 516. The Desire 516 was just approved by the Chinese authorities, and thus we might be seeing this device officially, but for those who are keen about the HTC devices, this is one decent enough to check out. </p>
<p> Having a 5-inch qHD display and running the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, the HTC Desire 516 is coming with the dimensions 140 x72 x 9.7 mm, and it isn’t real light because the weight of the device is 173gm. Having the TD-SCDMA connectivity as per the certification in China, it is said to be coming for the China Mobile network. The internal specs of the HTC Desire 516 include a 1.3 GHz quad-core CPU, 512MB of RAM, the 5-megapixel rear camera with flash and a VGA front-facing camera. Of course we aren’t much impressed with the low RAM. </p>
<p> For these basic specs, we expect the Desire 516 to be a pretty basic and budget handset. And as per the source, there are two variants to be available – the one which we detailed above, and second one having a 1.2 GHz quad-core processor, 1GB RAM and running the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean OS. Another indication on this device being in the low range, is that HTC had mentioned that they would be concentrating on mid-to-low end devices this year, apart from the new HTC One 2014 edition which is yet to be announced. </p>
<p> The device doesn’t look really good in the photos leaked, but we are sure HTC will come up with a few color options for this. For now, these are the only details available and we would be updating soon when HTC makes this device official. Apart from this device, the new HTC One is expected to be announced by the end of March 2014, so you should be looking at that if you wanted something in the high-end range from HTC. </p>

<p> According to the latest reports, the Taiwanese company posted a third-quarter net profit after tax of NT$600 million ($19 million). That’s roughly a quarter of the profit made in the previous three months, but a big improvement over this time last year when HTC reported its first loss in a decade. HTC has struggled to keep pace with larger rivals such as Apple and Samsung. In China, HTC faces stiff competition from manufacturers such as Xiaomi, which became the No. 3 smartphone vendor in the world in the third quarter, according to IDC and Strategy Analytics. </p>
<p> HTC earlier this year set out to expand its portfolio beyond its single flagship HTC One smartphone, bringing back the Desire family of smartphones in an effort to increase its market share. The company hasn’t given exact figures for which phones are selling well. </p>

<p> HTC announced a cheaper variant of the Desire 820, named as HTC Desire 820s, on its Weibo account. The Desire 820s comes with almost identical specifications to the Desire 820, apart from sporting a 64-bit 1.7GHz octa-core MediaTek MT6752 processor with 4G LTE connectivity and Mali T760 GPU instead of the 64-bit octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 SoC (1.5GHz quad-core + 1.0GHz quad-core) of the original.

<p> HTC Desire 820 Smartphone Review </p>
<p> While the HTC has been known for its flagship phones, many might not be aware of the fact that HTC doesn’t necessarily compromise on the quality built of their devices. And the successor to the desire 816, is the Desire 820. We have been testing this device since past weeks, and here’s our review of the same. </p>
<p> Design </p>
<p> First talking about the design on Desire 820. HTC has taken some design aesthetics from the spiritual successor Desire 816. But it’s been improved pretty much in the overall design. Though, it’s still made of polycarbonate glossy material and round corners, and sides. But this time around the device is completely Unibody, as well as a lot thinner. Whether it is plastic or metal, HTC has proven to build quality phones over the time. And they have done it again with the desire 820. However, it does feel slippery solid, but it also feel lightweight for big screen device with large bezels. </p>
<p> My favorite part about the design is its accent colors, which makes it stand out from the crowd. Talking about the edges, the volume is choked up to high for a single-handed usage while the power placement was much-needed improvement done by HTC. Everything is usually placed; 3.5mm jack is at top, microUSB port at bottom and a single plastic flap on the left side that houses a single microSD and two SIM slots. This won’t be an HTC device if it does not have front facing Boomsound speakers. And there are absolutely no surprises here; they sound extremely good. </p>
<p> Display </p>
<p> Between those two speakers is the 5.5.-inch display, coming in a 720p resolution. Though, it might not be the sharpest thing in the world, with resolution being spread in 5.5-inch screen. But HTC does know how to make a good display panel regardless of the display resolution. And here 820’s display is as good as it can be on a 720p display. With a nice amount of brightness, natural color, and solid outdoor visibility, it might not be the highest-end panel out there. But it still every enjoyable to use, especially for games and videos. </p>
<p> Hardware/Performance </p>
<p> Inside the Desire 820 the work starts to get interesting, as it is powered by the new 64-bit Snapdragon processor from Qualcomm, which is an Octa-core chip. While it is still running the 32-bit software, you still have the comfort to know that if and when the Android Lollipop update arrives, then your phone will have the hardware to take advantage of the major upgrade. The performance right now stands as a very snappy and responsive. </p>
<p> Considering this is a mid-range phone, for that the experience is pretty high-end. So, whether it is doing something as simple as opening an app or doing multitasking and playing high-end game, the Desire 820 handles everything pretty neat, without causing a much of the problem. As far as the battery life is concerned you are looking at the 2600mAh battery. I would say that battery life is quite good, but nothing spectacular, as I was getting around 12-15 hours of charging. So, it’s definitely enough to get you through full day, but wouldn’t expect it more than that. </p>
<p> Software </p>
<p> Taking a look at the software, you are looking at Android 4.4.4 Kitkat with Sense 6.0 on top of it. And if you are familiar with HTC’s UI, you find your way around quickly, as the experience hasn’t changed all that much. And that’s why it is still a fan favorite. Best part about sense is that it brings all the enhancements to Android, while still maintain a smooth and snappy experience, which is something you can’t say about other Android interfaces. </p>
<p> Camera </p>
<p> With the camera on Desire, you are looking at the 13MP sensor with LED flash. And the camera interface hasn’t changed much from previous HTC devices, which is a simple and cleaner interface. You can control, ISO, white balance, exposure and all the usual stuff you might expect. There are couple of new modes now like a split capture that lets you take photos front the front and back camera at a time. As well as a photo booth mode, which lets you take several photos and compile them together just like the real photo booth photos. </p>
<p> With 13MP sensor you can take pretty good photos in the natural sufficient light conditions. But more often the exposure and white balance will usually be way off, causing a lot of details to be lost. HDR however does eliminate the issue to some extent. Though, it doesn’t get much better in low-light, resulting in a lot of noise. It is virtually impossible to take useful photos in dim-light conditions. The front-facing camera is worth mentioning simply because it has a high-resolution 8MP module. So, if you are into selfies, you can take a lot of advantage from the photo booth and split capture feature that I mentioned earlier. </p>
<p> Cons </p>
<p> There are no particular things that I didn’t like about Desire 820, but the device does get heat up more than usual while playing games, and that’s all thanks to the 64-bit chipset. And as well as the glossy design goes, the smudge and fingerprints were left all the time on its back panel. </p>
<p> Verdict </p>
<p> Coming down to the verdict, the device is a great catch for the HTC fans, Even though, company supposedly placing it in mid-range, we are not sure why. With great build quality at the price tag of around INR 21,000, this will be the as closest it gets to have a high-end specs under a mid-range price point. </p>

<p> hello! everyone, how are you? I tried to root my htc desire a 1818 (orange htc with htc sense on the back) to install our Burmese font. I took my htc phone’s battery out and put in back. and i pressed power button and volume down button at the same time to get recovery mode. i enter recovery, mount and storage and i happened to do format system and wide cache/ data as well. now when i reboot my device/ open my phone, it show just light and HTC on the screen. if anyone know how to fix it to get menu/ icons back on the phone screen, please advice me how to do it. Great thanks !!!!! </p>
<p> it worked on my first try. it did not even took more than 5mins. and EVERYTHING is working!!! im really excited!!!!! thanks for the FAST, STABLE, BEAUTIFUL rom!!!!!! really appreciate it 🙂 </p>
<p> ha, it works ! i´m definitely not a geek, and made it work – or maybe i am somehow. Humm.. let´s see, some apps are more mature mainly on the look and feel side of story. all the memory i saved when installing gingerbread already consumed, and i´d put nothing but the ordinary in, battery lasts slighlty longer indeed, at least it don´t run out at 6 pm ! The mouse track lost a bit of sensibility 🙁 still to find a way to fix this… keep pushing, this is getting better every day. </p>
<p> mine just keeps loading to the green oxygen screen and stays there. i want to reverse the 2.3 install and go back to 2.2. how do i do so? </p>
<p> I try to up grade my HTC Desire to 2.3 and error come out error 152. Cannot boot and install any more. </p>
<p> I have HTC desire, wanted to upgrade to 2.3 gingerbread, followed instructions all seemed to work but now my phone is just constantly rebooting itself. </p>
<p> I’ve tried the advice I found elsewhere to solve the problm but nothing worked </p>
<p> I have updated my HTC desire to Gingerbread 2.3 without any issues so far and am posting step by step on how to upgrade, You can find it at </p>
<p> Since upgrading to 2.3, which seemed to install fine, I have major bugs with text messaging. If I start to text, then delete a couple of characters, the phone jumps in a loop of delete mesages by selection. When I finally get out of this I can’t type anything until I press the menu button and then cancel it. Then I can finish the text, but after this to send the message the phone jumps up to the first message I ever sent to the person and I have to scroll through all of the old messages until I reach the bottom to press the send button. Has anyone had this problem? Also wifi keeps dropping out which used to be really solid. HTC Desire HD on Orange. Would really apprecate a fix for this as it’s really frustrating. Phone was brilliant before the upgrade. </p>
<p> hello, anyone can help me??? i have HTC desire, after install android 2.3, my phone can’t access internet by using 3G. please reply me ASAP.. </p>
<p> hey kenny, you will have to configure the APN Settings, kindly contact your service provider for the same! </p>
<p> this also ruined my phone as it now will not boot up at all….just the white htc screen </p>
<p> I revived the update 2.3 for my phone it all works well, apart from piccasa web albums. It wing open and every so often I get a message telling me to force close piccasa even when I’m not using it. </p>
<p> i have an error during installation, the error is while attempting to run privileged command.. what i do </p>
<p> Checking for phone system software updates manually From the Home screen, press MENU, and then tap Settings. Tap About phone > System software updates. Tap Check now. simples </p>
<p> Followed complete instructions, now phone hangs on white htc boot screen. Hope it isn’t bricked. </p>
<p> Got the phone working again with restore of backup. I’ll wait for the official release… </p>
<p> I upgraded successfully from 2.1 eclair to 2.3.3 Gingerbread from rom manager premium with just a simple download.. works like a charm…. Most of all I got got what I really wanted, the hotspot option and it save battery power forever…. HTC Desire CDMA </p>
<p> Did work fine! But why the hell don’t you mention the fact that it is OXYGEN ROM anywhere. This is of no use if you really want to have the complete Gingerbread update. I guess I have to wait for the official one since it will be out in a few weeks for my Desire… </p>
<p> I have exactly the same problem that “Nare Pesso”. And i don´t know how to come back to the last 2.2 froyo android version which worked perfectly… I think people will be try those flash before to upload to ingenuous people that I, used it…. Have anyone reproduce and any solution about this issue? Best regards Juanjo </p>
<p> hi all, does anyone know for sure if htc official v2.3 update has been released ? i read some news that it’d be available by the April! </p>
<p> is this the official android 2.3 or it is edited with a developer if it is the official one why is the oxygen logo at the initiation of the phone?? </p>
<p> I followed the instructions above and all went well till it got stuck in a black screen with the word OXYGEN in sparkling green appeared. It is stuck in this screen and cannot be restarted by the power button. Removing the battery and restarting normally after 1-5 minutes brings the same black screen with green OXYGEN which occasionally blinks or goes off for 1/2 a second. Taking out the battery and rebooting with “volume – down and power button” will reboot into rooted mode and I can then do a recovery boot and install from the sd card or restore or install zip or rom, none of these attempts have ended in anything other than the black screen with the OXYGEN. Any ideas? </p>
<p> Just need to update The latest package is rc7 (Today is 27/Jan/2011) download here: </p>
<p> noob here & i’ve not upgraded a phone OS before so I must be missing something. Why do it this way (which isn’t that straightforward) when there seems to be a built in ‘system update’ facility? What are the (potential) problems with just letting the phone do the update itself? [I’m on 2.2 atm] many thanks </p>
<p> Please write a step by step tutorial on how to install JDK, Eclipse, ADT plugin & Android gingerbread SDK 2.3 on Computer. </p>
<p> Scrap that, it all working perfectly, just needed a restart then it all worked great </p>
<p> it (rc6) worked just nice… but got stuck with inability to download apps from market. Clearing market cache, etc didnt help… will be trying out rc7 and if not stable enough, will switch to leedroid 2.2 </p>
<p> It doesn’t work with my HTC Desire! After select Android 2.3 ROM, the screen shows OXYGEN and don’t initialize! </p>

<p> I have the HTC Droid Incredible. I received an update for Gingerbread on 9/7/2011 and went ahead updated. I have lost all my pictures and videos on my SD card after the update. I also lost my music files but I think I can get them back from the Amazon website. Hopefully they are still there. I dismounted the SD card and Mounted again to see if that would fix the problem and did not. Also, I hooked the phone to my PC and tried to read the SD card from there and it shows nothing. </p>
<p> I have noticed decreased battery life and weaker signal strength. I did do the *228 update to see if it would improve, it did not. </p>
<p> Please let me know what I can do to retrive my photos. This is sickning and can’t believe that just happened. I did do a back up of my phone to my PC a couple of months ago. I should have backed up before the update. </p>
<p> I had the exact same thing happen – this is really a horrible occurance, I had pictures and videos on there from years ago, in retrospect I really should have backed them up. The fact is, though, they’re gone now, through no fault of my own. Needless to say I’m pretty PO’d, not to mention deeply sad. Anyone out there know what to do for us?? </p>
<p> that us the reason we say you should always create a backup before firmware update and also tell you to follow the instructions! </p>
<p> The instructions above state this “Firstly, you will have to make sure that your phone is rooted and need to first download and install the ROM manager from the Android Market place.” </p>
<p> Is there a way to revert back to the software that originally came on the phone if you have problems? </p>
<p> if you must you can just hard reset your phone.. i beleive that should take the updates off… </p>
<p> no, unless and untill you select something like “Root” the phone will not get rooted! </p>
<p> ok my htc droid incredible came stock with 2.2 will i get OTA 2.3 i checked for software update said its up to date on 2.2 so will i see 2.3 or do i need to do anything special for it ? yes no thank you all (my droid is not rooted yet… trying to keep it that way so hoping to see the update using the OTA </p>
<p> So is the only bug for this version of 2.3 that the video camera will be disabled? </p>
<p> its nice ONLY ONE PROB. Cant video record. it freezes when u hit the record button </p>
<p> @neppah5 yes if you are on 2.2.1 then Gingerbread will be an OTA. If your manufacturer decides to power your device from 2.1 to 2.3 then you will not get OTA updates as 2.1 doesn’t have the feature to update OTA! </p>

<p> HTC One in European Countries getting Android 4.3 & Sense 5.5 Update with 25GB Drive Storage </p>
<p> The HTC One Android smartphone in the European countries is receiving the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean OS update along with the update to the user interface, to the Sense 5.5 version and this brings quite a few changes. It’s the Software update version 3.62.401.1 which is of size 675.48 MB and it brings in the following changes to both the OS and the interface, and that for sure would be making the performance of the smartphone better. </p>
<p> HTC One Update Change Log </p>
<p> Sense 5.5 </p>
<p> Improvements to Video Highlights </p>
<p> Improvements to BlinkFeed The special BlinkFeed feature, just like the Flipboard app has got a few changes which include: </p>
<p> Accessing recommended news from your social network </p>
<p> Additional global news sources </p>
<p> Save articles to read them later or when offline </p>
<p> Creating custom feeds from news media, Twitter and Youtube </p>
<p> Embedded music channel with new scenes </p>
<p> Improvements to Sense TV </p>
<p> Adding My Picks Page to improve the program management </p>
<p> Apart from these, HTC is offering 25GB of free storage through Google Drive, which the users can get by going to the Drive app in their phone after the update. Earlier the same storage was given along with the HTC One Max phablet which was recently launched. This drive space would be available for 2 years. </p>
<p> The changes made in the interface in this OS update is quite different from the one that was sent to the HTC One smartphones in the US and Taiwan. Apart from the European devices, it is the Asian devices too which would get the update with the Android version 4.2 and Sense 5.0 going to Android 4.3 and Sense 5.5. </p>
<p> It is an Over-the-air update which comes directly to the device when it is connected to the Internet, and if it hasn’t already, go to the About section in Settings where there is an option to check for the software update manually. </p>

<p> HTC HD2 – Steps to Install Android 2.3 Gingerbread OS </p>
<p> What if i say that you can install Android 2.3 Gingerbread on your HTC HD2 in simpler and in a shorter manner as many of us might agree with me that HTC HD2 has got a lame operating system that is Windows Mobile 6.0 version as the best part of this is due to the hardware of HTC HD2 you can install almost every android version ranging from Froyo to Gingerbread on your device. So, let’s proceed and check out how you can install the latest Gingerbread 2.3 version on HTC HD2. Thought the build is not a final one or 100% optimized one but is an AOSP build. </p>
<p> Procedure to install Gingerbread 2.3 on HTC HD2: </p>
<p> First of all you need to download the AOSP build file MDJ Android 2.3 Gingerbread AOSP Build for your HTC HD2 device and need to save the same on your desktop. </p>
<p> Now, you need to copy the Android folder into the root of your SD card. You need to copy the data.img file into the Android folder. </p>
<p> Now, you need to run the exe file with the name CLRXAD.exe on your HTC HD2 with the help of file explorer. </p>
<p> After running the exe file you will need to run the HARET.exe on your HTC HD2 device. </p>
<p> So within 10-15 minutes your HTC HD2 will boot up and there you go you can see that your device is now working on the Android’s Gingerbread operating system and not on lame Windows operating system 6.0. So, in just four simple steps to be precise you can easily install Gingerbread on your HTC HD2. </p>

<p> – On computer, download and unzip indicated file – “MDJ Android 2.3 Gingerbread AOSP Build” – Connect Phone to Computer via USB, copy Android folder to root of SD-Card of Phone. I am not sure what does \root\ signify? – Copy one of data.img files (1024=T-Mobile_USA, 512=European) into phone’s Android folder. I copied 512 .img file as I have a phone I bought in India , unlocked – Detach USB connection (no longer needed) and when I see to run the files on my phone I don’t see ANDROID folder which I copied – I reconnect the phone to my PC and I see that the Android folder isn’t there. </p>

<p> After spent lot of time looking for good advice how to install Android on my HTC HD2 Tmobile Usa, happily I found this excellent site. I read several times the instructions and the comments and experience from other users in order to avoid any problem and frustration in case of no success. I am extremelly satisfied now with Android. I was scared when a file .7z was copied but I found how to unzipped and finally …very important…Install the application to keep DUAL applications WP6.5 and Android, because after restarting the phone , it always got WP instead of Android. Now my phone have the two systems. Do not give up. Read this thread and learn from other’s experience. Thanks everybody !!! </p>
<p> It looks like alot of people aren’t having a success, including myself, I got a few lines at the top and a black screen for more than 30mins many times still not working I’m pretty sure I followed every step exactly, but there must be something different between my phone and sucessful ones? </p>
<p> I ahve downloaded the file to my computer. If i open the zip folder i get an android folder and then 3 .img folders. Do i copy all 3 to the android folder then copy the android folder to the root on my hd2? Then run the two things inside the android folder from my cell? Also will this lock my phone if it is unlocked? I have never rooted before so please help! </p>
<p> No problems to install 😉 but there`s still one problem if i don’t talk about all the lags … but why does the battery work for 3 days if windows is active an if i avtivate android the phone turns off after 6 hours :/ </p>
<p> Following are details.of my device. Radio 204.50.22.2 Rom 143.405 Flash size 512 mb.Have done as specified but my device stops booting after 5 lines and then dark screen. My device is htc hd2 leo. Does Gingerbread work on this if not which android os should I use .Thanks </p>
<p> No offense meant; but I have the same issue of starting in windows. I went through the file explorer and ran the two exe’s in order to get back to android. But after reading these threads I may try dual boot setup. I went to the link above and the author is fairly clear right at the top about it not working on an htc hd2. Something about no snapdragon yet. This is just an FYI, not a flame. I’m a noob. </p>
<p> Here is a link to a simple program that will let you dual boot into either Windows or Android upon startup without having to go through file explorer. http://jmzsoft.com/?p=12 </p>
<p> Please advise that I should install JMZ Dual Boot on “My Device” or on “SD Card” ? Which one? </p>
<p> it was working fine utill i reboot my cell….after rebooting it booted on windows again :/ what to do? </p>
<p> download dual boot from this link & follow following steps </p>
<p> 1. install android 2.3 on SD Card </p>
<p> 2. power off cell </p>
<p> 3. remove SD CArd and install JMZ dual boot </p>
<p> 4. power off cell </p>
<p> 5. insert SD card back in and turn on ur cell…..it should ask u for android or windows boot </p>
<p> Please advise that I should install JMZ Dual Boot on “My Device” or on “SD Card” ? Which one? </p>
<p> Even after reading all the comments and replies, I’m still confused as to which img file need be copied and whereto? </p>
<p> 1. Copy all the folders (containing data.img) to Android folder? 2. Copy all the folders (containing data.img to root? 3. Copy selected file to root? 4. Copy selected file to Android folder? </p>
<p> If 3 or 4, which file? I bought the phone from India. </p>
<p> will my contacts be erased wen I install android 2.3 on my htc hd2… PLISS LET ME KNOW BEFORE I DO ANYTHING THANKS 😀 </p>
<p> disadvantages of android 2.3 in hd2 : video recording not working, gps is not working battery will charge long time (3 hours) barrery backup is very low, when compared to 6.5 internet data connection is turn off frequently because incoming call, incoming sms , outgoing cal internet data connection is donot turn on automatic camera photo is bad when andriod is running, at the same time card is removed, os is damaged when watching movie or torrent download, button lights turn on and turn off, it creat distrubance </p>
<p> u r clearly mis-informed, i run Ultimate Droid 3.3 (2.3.3) build off nand on my hd2… Video recording works (800×480)!! 720P video playback!! GPS works !! Battery charges in less than 2 hrs and last for @least 30hrs (moderate usage).. Internet connection/ Suto sync connects & remains on regardless of calls, sms or mms… Camera (5MP) works!! Android is running off NAND and so i can unmount my sd card & re-mount whenever… </p>
<p> Get ur facts straight before criticizing…Ignorance is no excuse. </p>
<p> Well Voncrane, this comment thread isn’t about the Untimate Droid, it’s about this version of Gingerbread and everything he listed is valid. It doesn’t work. So unless you are running the ROM that this thread is about, then you shouldn’t call people ignorant. Sounds like you are the ignorant one who just came into a thread that you didn’t know about. </p>
<p> All I get is the black screen — I’ve waited 20minutes, 40minutes and now, 45minutes before shutting off the phone (taking the battery out ’cause it won’t shut off normally), formatting the sd card, copying the files on it again and going through the steps one more time. </p>
<p> Any idea why it’s not working? Should I let the phone try to boot up all by itself even if it means waiting a couple of hours? </p>
<p> Hello, i have done all the steps and still its goes back to windows again, and i dont have CLXAD i have CLRCAD, i tried to put all the data files in the android map and it doesnt work, i tried to only use the data 1024 but it didnt work either.. do i have to clean the SD card before i put the android map there? </p>
<p> after i do everything it reboots and goes back to windows. what’s going on? thanks </p>
<p> Which data.img file must I choose beause there are 3 data.img file (256, 512,1024)? </p>
<p> hi im harsha i have tried this. it works super though it crashes some times. i do not have the navigation icon / program anywhere in it… </p>
<p> how to add this program, the one with an arrow usually found in android </p>
<p> i cant download the file when u go to that link there is more than one file which one do i download please help :()((( </p>
<p> y is it telling me to unzip some files. including the data.img file (which won’t unzip) </p>
<p> You should try to download the files again and unzip it. Please click the below link to download the files for Gingerbread 2.3 Android. </p>
<p> If you still facing the same problem, then I think you dont have the unzip application in your system. </p>
<p> It works super with my HD2 …. only thing is that the multi-touch-function doesn’t work. Not at big deal, but I’d like it to work 🙂 </p>
<p> is this only for T-mobile? how about singapore version of HTC HD2, i think it name as “LEO”? </p>
<p> it is working on leo model i have installed and i am using it presently great work by dev thanks </p>
<p> When I turn off my HTC will it revert back to Windows? If so, will my apps and contacts saved in the Android OS be delete? </p>
<p> that depends on the coding actually, if it has that capability to use the apps simultaneously then it can be used but generally you cannot use. </p>
<p> nice post, you are really helping people who are using androids, this particular installation guide helped me, thanks </p>
<p> To everyone who is having issues where it sits at the black screen, I had this, I fixed it by updating the window ROM from the HTC site. When windows was updated to newest version for my network I tried again and it worked! </p>
<p> @Ric no! it doesn’t you will have to unlock your phone first and then yo can update it. </p>
<p> so i did everything rite but one i try too boot it up it goes to the htc screen with green letter then goes to a black screen then reboots into windows 6.5 again…btw i had another android program download on my phoen but i took that off too download this new improved one. what am i doing wrong? and do i have too copy just teh android folder into my phoen or all 4 folders into my phone? </p>
<p> every thing working with 512 mb image except vedio recording any body have idea to solve this.please email to me .thanks </p>
<p> you just need to download from the above link and need to put the same in your phone </p>
<p> * Works like a charm. Thanks guys. Here’s how I followed the instructions; </p>
<p> – On computer, download and unzip indicated file – “MDJ Android 2.3 Gingerbread AOSP Build” – Connect Phone to Computer via USB, copy Android folder to root of SD-Card of Phone – Copy one of data.img files (1024=T-Mobile_USA, 512=European) into phone’s Android folder – Detach USB connection (no longer needed) – On Phone, use File Explorer to go to Android folder, run (click) CLRXAD.exe – On Phone, same folder, run HARET.exe – Done. Watch Android Gingerbread boot up </p>
<p> Cannot run CLRCAD.exe. Using ASTRO File manager gets me to: “File type exe not found” message 🙁 </p>
<p> I’ve copied the files to the SD used, clrad and the haret, then the HD2 screen goes black, with a message is the top left… Jumping to kernel… i’ve waited for 40 min but nothing happend.. and my phone is not operator locked.. help please… </p>
<p> I’ve copied the files to the SD used, clrad and the haret, then the HD2 screen goes black, with a message is the top left… Jumping to kernel… i’ve waited for 20 min but nothing happend.. </p>
<p> So my question is, is my hd2 actually running android or is it a ROM? In anycase, i am planning on unlocking it to use on att, so should i do this before installing android or does it not make a difference? </p>
<p> THIS IS NOT WORKING My phone shows black display with small text in left corner, ive waited for 20 minutes and nothing 🙁 </p>
<p> same here and now I had it set all night and nothing has happened and now I try again and still nothing has happened in 30min after it went to black screen with small textile in the left corner right up </p>
<p> @Matt,is ur phone is running now, i mean are you able to use all the apps in your phone? </p>
<p> My phone now shows a black screen with a small amount of text in the top left corner informing me it is shutting down the hardware and jumping to Custom Kernel. Is this normal? </p>
<p> Did you have the CLRXAD.exe or the CLRCAD.exe? With the CLRCAD.exe, it does not work and there is no CLRXAD.exe that is in the Android file. Please help, TIA1 </p>
<p> Installation procedure is not detailed enough. There is 3 data files, how we should handle them not mentioned. </p>
<p> I will say, put the data file (for T-Mobile USA 1024, for European 512) into Android root directory. </p>
<p> I am also wondering if I need to copy all 3 of the data.img files over. They are located in 3 different folders. </p>
<p> There are 3 different img files… do you need to copy all 3 in to the android file? </p>
<p> When I click on it it takes me to where it shows alot of downloads. Which download buttom do I click on? I know its suppose to be easy but im not a computer geek </p>
<p> I am trying to download the Android 2.3 Gingerbread but now sure if im even doing it right. It takes me to where I download things other than Gingerbread. Can u pls help. </p>
<p> as of now i can sense that you are on a slow network.. try the same on WiFi that might solve your issue. </p>
<p> Why the Navigation app always shown Checking navigation availability on my Samaung Galaxy S phone? </p>

<p> Comments: Instructions to find out if the device is unlocked and rooted would be in place at the end of the first paragraph. Tell users the required size of SD card if that could be a limitation Steps to wiping the cache would be nice in step 5 </p>
<p> Thanks for the guide, great help. I’ve just gone through the process and everything worked fine up until the phone rebooted; now it just stays on the Cyanogen boot screen constantly. Any advice would be much appreciated? </p>
<p> I go through the process, select the file, tick the options…it then prompts me to re-boot my phone….nothing happens after that… </p>

This rumored device is said to be powered by 1.4 GHz quad core Snapdragon 400 processor coupled with 1 GB of RAM. This mini flagship is going to have 16 GB of internal storage as seen in HTC One mini, but it did not feature a microSD card slot to expand the storage and this new mini flagship will be having that option giving the users the advantage of to expand the memory up on the phones built in memory. </p>

<p> HTC One M8 vs. Samsung Galaxy S5 Comparison – The Battle of the Flagships </p>
<p> HTC had just unveiled its latest flagship device, the HTC One (M8) after a long wait and all the rumors around it for months. We have seen this device is a powerful enough device and it also comes with the secondary rear camera that will be used to take depth information of the pictures and new features like UFocus, Foregrounder and more. So let us compare this Flagship of HTC with the Flagship of Samsung, that is the Galaxy S5 which has many new features like heart rate sensor, finger print scanner and much more. </p>
<p> Form Factor- Size, Shape </p>
<p> Galaxy S5 has the dimensions 142 x 72.5 x 8.1 and weights 145 grams, where as its competitor has the dimensions of 146.4 x 70.6 x 9.4 mm and weights 160 grams. The flagship HTC has a metal unibody with a curved finish where as the Galaxy S5 has a double dotted cover on its back that gives a better grip to the Smart phone. The HTC One M8 is thicker and heavier compared to the Galaxy S5 but the metal body might make the HTC One M8 heavier but still it gives a premium feel. </p>
<p> 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 inches (146.4 x 70.6 x 9.4 mm) </p>
<p> 5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 inches (142 x 72.5 x 8.1mm) </p>
<p> Display </p>
<p> The new flagship from Samsung, the Samsung Galaxy S5 has a 5.1 inch Super AMOLED display with 1080 pixels resolution giving out 432 ppi. Whereas the HTC One M8 has a 5 inch display a 0.1 inch lesser than its competitor with the same 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution found in Galaxy S5 and has 441 ppi pixel density. There is not much of a difference in terms of the display in both the devices </p>
<p> Internal Specifications </p>
<p> The Galaxy S5 will come with a 2.5 GHz quad-core chipset, while the U.S models of the M8 will have a 2.3 GHz quad-core processor to power it. Both the devices are coupled with Adreno 330 GPU and 2 GB of RAM and will be running on Android 4.4 KitKat Operating System. The Galaxy has slightly upgraded OS with 4.4.2 KitKat. So even here we could not find much difference between these two devices. </p>
<p> Camera – Rear & Front </p>
<p> The new HTC One M8 has a 4.1 ultrapixel camera and a secondary rear camera that takes depth information of the pictures and on the front there is a good 5 MP camera for video calling also selfies. The Samsung Galaxy S5 has a 16 MP camera on the rear that is capable of shooting 4K videos and on the other side there is a 2.1 MP front facing camera. </p>
<p> Storage/ Battery </p>
<p> Both the flagship devices come in 16 GB and 32 GB variants and also have micro SD card slot to increase memory up to 128 GB so in terms of memory there is no difference between both the devices. The battery on the Samsung Galaxy S5 is at 2800 mAh that can be removable while on the HTC One M8 it is tad lesser at 2600 mAh and non-removable. </p>
<p> Pricing and Final Verdict </p>
<p> The Pricing of the HTC One M8 is not yet known as it was unveiled couple of days back and the Samsung Galaxy S5 that was unveiled at the MWC 2014 is set for a release on April 11th 2014 and that is priced quite high when compared to the previous flagship devices, as the pricing of that in India is from Rs. 51000. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> HTC One M9 vs One M8: Should you upgrade your Phone? </p>
<p> Well, HTC might have become a victim of too many leaks this year, with even an official video and now a Best Buy listing which have nearly confirmed the rumoured specifications of the new HTC flagship. Now that the device has been announced with what was expected are looking forward to upgrading to the latest HTC flagship? If yes, let us tell you why you should go with this upgrade. </p>
<p> Design – Better than competition </p>
<p> The new HTC One M9 has the same design language that was seen on the last year’s M8 model. While many argue that HTC should have brought something new, well your complaints might be logical. But it is also true that the last year’s model has one of the best designs we have seen on flagship smartphone. Considering that you should give a chance to make M9 its case for the flagship of the year title. One of the design issues that M9 addressed was the placement of the power button. Previously it was placed on the top edge; now it has been moved to the right edge for more comfortable stance, although, it also depends on what you consider a bad or good position. </p>
<p> Display – No Quad HD is a good thing </p>
<p> You may see this as a bad thing that company didn’t include a 2K display, and some of you may would already considered that if no 2K display on a flagship, would it be any worth to me? Well, the answer is yes because a Full HD display is quite frankly enough if you are not looking to take a hit on the battery life. All these high-resolution 256 x 1440 pixel displays does is that they use too much battery, as to produce that much of resolution on a 5-inch smartphone you need a bigger battery rating, which is always not possible as it affects the compactness of the device. Therefore, it may be a wise decision by the company that they didn’t opted for 2K display, and instead packed the Full HD LCD3 display. </p>
<p> Software – Android Lollipop </p>
<p> HTC fans would love this upgrade while the non-HTC users know for a fact that the Sense UI is one of the snappier interfaces out there. The new Sense 7 UI will be based on the Android Lollipop 5.0.2. Though, we wouldn’t say that there are too many radical changes done on the new Sense 7 when compared to Sense 6. But there are enough changes done in the visual and features departments that would undoubtedly give Sense 7 some advantage over the previous version. </p>
<p> The visual changes on the latest Sense UI are more subtle. Like the Weather/Clock widget has now italic font. Though, you get more than that, there are customizable themes, a dynamic smart launcher, as well as a lock screen with contextual suggestions. It is a good thing that HTC doesn’t like to alienate their users by completely changing the features, but instead improves them not by changing their complete appearances. And that is maintained by the new Sense 7 UI. </p>
<p> Hardware – Processor and Memory </p>
<p> When comparing the hardware on the old and new flagship phones, one thing can be kept in mind, consistency. That’s what company has done on its M9, when moving from M8 hardware. While the design language is same, the processor has been bumped up to a latest Octa-Core 64-bit Snapdragon 810 chipset. It is coupled with massive 3GB RAM and the new Adreno 430 GPU for supporting the high-end graphics for gaming. </p>
<p> Talking about consistency, company has still maintained its standard internal storage option to 32GB. It is not terrible because the 32GB is still considered an abundant storage. Moreover, you have an option to expand storage via microSD card. </p>
<p> Camera – Low light Selfie </p>
<p> The gimmicky UltraPixel Duo camera on the M8 received its part of the controversy. It has been all seen when we compared the camera with its rivals last year. While it doesn’t come in line with other rear cameras on its competition, but we did like how the low light scene was captured by that UltraPixel. It probably made sense to HTC that they should shift that camera to the front, which is where the low light capture is often required. And eventually that sounds more promising than putting the UltraPixel on back. </p>
<p> And if you still want to get convinced that M8 is still a good option for you, then, there is only one reason for that; you love your M8 camera shots and believes that the UltraPixel camera is good enough for you to go by this year too. Then, you may not necessarily need to upgrade to the new device, as the Android Lollipop update for M8 has already been released while most of the things are same like display. </p>

<p> I haven’t decided on the m9 yet. I’m eligible in August for an upgrade and I’m hoping by then there will be an m9 max if not it will be a tough decision to make. </p>

<p> 9 Things You Probably Didn’t Know About HTC One M9 </p>
<p> After announcing its latest flagship today, the HTC One M9, the Taiwanese company may have finally taken a breath, as there were many rumours about the device and already leaked official video and the recent hands-on before the launch of the device. Though, there are some things about M9 that you probably didn’t know about. If you were wondering the same thing, then, we have got you covered. </p>
<p> Camera – Low-light Selfie </p>
<p> Remember the 4MP UltraPixel that was found in the M7 and M8 now has been moved to the front. Though, it is only one camera module placed on the top of the display, as there was no space for the duo setup that was found on M8 on back. Its greatest strength is low-light photography, so it does indeed a stand a chance to be one of the better selfie shooters out there. </p>
<p> Design – Similar but different </p>
<p> Company draws experience and expertise of high-end watchmakers, and how they integrate the use of metal is all about that. As it now introduced a dual finish metal uni-body design, although it is much similar to what was seen on M8. The phone has a jewelry grade finish, which makes it scratch resistant and avoid slips on distinct ridges, and for a fact that was a common problem with M8. For better or worse, the volume button has been split into two separate keys for up and down. </p>
<p> Processor – Powerful Chipset </p>
<p> The HTC One M9 is the second handset that feature a Snapdragon 810, while Samsung is not using this chipset on its new Galaxy S6. So, it makes an advantage for HTC to providing this chipset. It will be compatible with LTE category 6 standards as well as TDD for India. </p>
<p> Software – Sense 7 UI </p>
<p> The One M9 would be the first device that would be coming with out of the box Android Lollipop, which integrates the new Sense 7. And apparently the Sense 7 UI has a new photo editor with shapes and options to combine two images into a single photo, as well as it will recommend apps based on your interests. The new features include the theme auto creator, which would make it very easy to personalize the appearance of the UI with wallpaper, icons everything. </p>
<p> Though, it is not yet known if the rumored Avatar maker, where users would be able to make avatars for their profiles. We would know we go hands-on with the device soon. Sense 7 isn’t just smart; it’s also beautiful. Sense generates themes on the basis of just a single photo you provide. You would also able to customize the navigation buttons, like adding the fourth button if ever needed to. </p>
<p> Camera App – Improved features </p>
<p> While the camera is bumped up to 20MP which is probably the Sony sensor that can be found on Xperia Z2 and Z3. But to make it even better, HTC has made drastic changes to its camera app. There will be separate editor and gallery app to access the photos. You will also find a lot of new filters with prismatic effects, animations, which would help you in shaping the photographer in you. While you can also save your RAW photos too, which would be only available as an additional download. Moreover, the new Gallery app would be able to pull images from all top photo locations like Dropbox, Flickr, Facebook, Instagram, etc. </p>
<p> Gestures – Something cool </p>
<p> There are some gestures that can be found on all the flagship phones, like double tap to wake, as well as some smart motions gestures for calling, camera app, etc. But this new three-finger gesture input on HTC One M9 is some new and unique. By swiping three fingers, you can send music to wireless speakers that support the standards, including the Harmon Kardon that company announced in its MWC event. </p>
<p> BoomSound – Better than ever </p>
<p> Yes, the BoomSound speakers are still here, but this time with Dolby Audio Surround 5.1 sound that makes it the only flagship with an incredibly amazing speaker output. While most of the companies thinks that the speaker output doesn’t matter to users, that when the HTC’s BoomSound speakers prove them wrong. </p>
<p> HTC Connect – Pair Up devices </p>
<p> Even though, this feature has been around for some time with HTC’s flagship model, but with a new generation company has improved the quality of this feature. They have also partnered up with a popular Harmon-Kardon to pair up this feature with their products. </p>
<p> Dot View Case – Version 2.0 </p>
<p> So, HTC decided to improve its Dot View Case, which was originally introduced with Last year’s M8. The second generation Dot View case sports several new features including the ability to create custom wallpapers, which can be created by just drawing them on the phone with your finger. What’s more amazing than that is now you can play games on the cover, yes that’s right, because why not. The gaming is what we had always wanted from a phone case. </p>

<p> Screen protectors like the sapphire ones are a must….ZAGG, Stealth Lite, Rhino and 3M screen protectors are awesome. If you can’t get your hands on one, get a GEARMAXX screen protector. They sell on ebay for cheap and are as high quality and durable! </p>

<p> The 10 Best Features in the HTC One Android Smartphone – The Best Smartphone Yet? </p>
<p> HTC was seeing itself fall in the business of smartphones, as it was Samsung and its range of Galaxy smartphones powered by the Android OS taking the highest share, followed by Apple and Nokia. The company has not kept the spirits low, as they have just launched what can be called one of the best Android smartphones, with the name HTC One. </p>
<p> It does have the quality to threaten the various brands and the high-end smartphones, especially the simple TouchWiz UI of the Samsung Galaxy smartphones with a beautiful and more intuitive interface, and the HTC One has got a lot more to prove its worth in the market. Let’s see what are the best things about the device. </p>
<p> Blinkfeed </p>
<p> Taking inspiration from the Live Tiles of the Windows Phone OS, the interface of the HTC One is powered by the BlinkFeed feature which replaces the static and a few live icons by the personalized stream that can display news, social networking updates, photos and videos from your friends etc. The BlinkFeed feature has got large tiles on the several home screens which makes it live and a lot more interactive. </p>
<p> Excellent Design – Unibody & Aluminum </p>
<p> Frankly, although Samsung has been producing some of the best devices in the market, its’ almost the same template in them. HTC has been trying out various designs, and the engineering has been rocking with the company coming out with some great external builds all the time. After the HTC One X’s classic body, now it’s the HTC One that comes in a premium look, all packed in an aluminum unibody. It would be coming in both Silver and Black colors. </p>
<p> Remote Control Feature </p>
<p> HTC has done it better than the other smartphone manufacturers, with the built-in remote control function that opens the gates for various possibilities with the various DTH and Cable TV services. According to a few sources, the company is in deals with several operators all around the world to provide packages and help users make the use of HTC One as a remote control too for the TVs, Set-top boxes and the receivers. </p>
<p> 1080p Display, High pixel density </p>
<p> The screen size of 4.7-inch looks pretty ideal for a smartphone and as always, the 5+-inch ones are the phablets which aren’t really comfortable as smartphones. And with that screen size, the 1920 x 1080 pixels of screen resolution is brilliant, as the Pixel density is 468 PPI. HTC had recently come up with the Droid DNA too, which had a 1080p display but the 5-inch display kept a lesser pixel density, though not much of a difference but technically one would take that into consideration. </p>
<p> Front Dual-Speakers </p>
<p> HTC was wisely included the speakers on the front side, and it has got two speakers, on the top and bottom of the screen and this would enable producing stereo sound without an obstruction while watching movies in landscape mode. </p>
<p> RAM and Storage </p>
<p> Except the rumors that Samsung could be coming up with a processor powered by 8 cores, there is no better processor than the one in the HTC One, as it has got a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 Quad-core processor clocking at 1.7GHz, and it is backed by 2GB of RAM. Now comes something that is really strong for multitasking and heavy app usage. </p>
<p> The UltraPixel Camera </p>
<p> A totally new imaging technology is being brought by HTC, through the HTC One which would have the UltraPixel camera which would have 300 percent more light than that on a 13-megapixel camera, and hence the data on the image becomes a lot better. The twist in the story is that the capturing is actually done using a 4-megapixel camera, but the size of the pixels is made larger on the sensor, thus enabling users to shoot vivid photos with a very wide range of colors and density. It is powered by an advanced CMOS sensor, adding to the advantage. </p>
<p> 1080p Video Recording With Both Cameras </p>
<p> It’s not just the UltraPixel camera that would do the wonders with Video recording, but even the 2.1-megapixel front camera located beside the speaker would be able to record 1080p Full HD videos, thanks to the 88-degree wide-angle lens. The rear one, that takes everyone away from the general concept of Megapixels, would be capturing videos at 1080p / 60 fps. </p>
<p> Wide Availability </p>
<p> The HTC One would come directly through 180 operators and be available in more than 80 countries, and would start shipping from March. That could be one of the big advantages over several other brands that enter the market with limited availability, thus limited buzz. </p>
<p> Loads of Connectivity Options </p>
<p> NFC, Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi, DLNA for wirelessly streaming media from the phone to a compatible TV or computer and the super-fast 4G LTE networking. The Micro-USB 2.0 (5-pin) port comes with the mobile high-definition video link (MHL) so that it would be good for both USB and HDMI connection. </p>
<p> A few things from HTC include the HTC Zoe, HTC BoomSound, HTC Sense TV which all are the enhancements of the features for the Camera, the dual speakers and the connectivity options. </p>
<p> What all we have mentioned above, is just based on the announcement done by HTC, but it could get still better after we get the hands-on with it. What do you feel is the best feature in the HTC One? </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Best HTC One Cases & Covers – 801e M7 </p>
<p> The HTC One looks excellent already, and we rate it as one of the best designs for an Android smartphone. But to keep it well maintained and help it protect from scratches and wearing-off of the top layer, there’s a lot of cases and covers available which would do the job of protection easier, and you won’t need to have your eye on the device all the time to see whether your heavy investment on a phone is being taken a good care of. </p>
<p> Below we list a few cases and protectors for the HTC One body, and these would range from as low as around $5 to high $xx too and that depends on the brand and features, so you can choose accordingly. </p>
<p> Cimo Grip Back Case Flexible TPU Cover </p>
<p> This grip back case is a flexible case made for the HTC One, and to add to the beauty already, it’s available in various colors like Frosted Clear, Black, Blue, Pink, Purple, Red, White and Green. The case is made of thermoplastic polyurethane giving it a bit of flexibility, and the raised recess on the front prevents the screen from touching the surface when the device is placed face down. The case gives some grip with the anti-slip property due to the material. </p>
<p> It is available for $9.96 (original price $29.98) </p>
<p> Coupon code: 44K4HJQ7 – 10% discount on 2 products purchased from Cimo Technologies TBTVCFPS – 15% discount on 3 or more products purchased from Cimo Technologies </p>
<p> OtterBox Commuter Series Hybrid Case for HTC One </p>
<p> The OtterBox one is an exterior shell, which is slick enough to easily slide in your pockets and the case gives easy access to all the buttons. Apart from the buttons, the case gives full access to the microphones for the proper call quality. It comes in several colors like Black, Green, Pink, Silver and Purple. </p>
<p> This case is available for $27.12. </p>
<p> Goospery Slim Fit Flexible TPU Jelly Case for HTC One </p>
<p> This is a case with the precision cutout for all the functions and access to all the ports, buttons, speakers and mic. The Thermoplastic Polyurethane material of the case resists the oil, dust and scratches and prevents the case / phone from slipping because of the elastic nature. There’s a UV coating on the case which helps in protecting the smartphone from any scratches, and that shimmers when the light is reflected on the surface. </p>
<p> This case is available for $5.99, and you get to choose from a big list of color options. </p>
<p> Diztronic Matte Back Black Flexible TPU Case for HTC One </p>
<p> The same Thermoplastic polyurethane material which we were talking about in the above cases, is used to make the Diztronic Matte back case, in which the matte finish helps in a better grip and resistance from fingerprints. The raised wrap near the corners helps in protecting the screen and the back panel area of the device. The best thing about this case it that it does the job, and doesn’t show itself as an exterior case, being quite thin at just 1.4mm and colors matching the phone’s external color. </p>
<p> This case is available for $9.99 and the color options are Matte Back Black, and Matte Back Aluminum Gray. </p>
<p> i-Blason For HTC One – Transformer Prime Series Case </p>
<p> This is one of the best sports cases if you call it, for the HTC One, having a very sturdy body and having two layers, the inner one being impact-resistant polycarbonate along with a shock absorbing silicone inner-sleeve, and the outer shell having a kickstand which can help in placing the phone anywhere in the landscape mode. The outer panel is black in color for all the variants, while the change is with the inner panel which is available in red, blue and black colors. </p>
<p> The best part of this is the $7.99 price which is very attractive for the material and the sturdiness provided by the case. </p>
<p> GreatShield Guardian S Series Slim-Fit Case for HTC One </p>
<p> GreatShield is one of the trusted names for the standard smartphone cases and thus we list the one for HTC One here, with the price of $6.99, and the color options being Black, Purple and Red. The material is just like many of those cases, i.e. Thermoplastic Polyurethane Resin. The slots for the buttons, speakers and the camera lens are all well shaped. </p>
<p> There’s a lot more types of cases available for the HTC One, but the above ones we shared do the best job in an economical way. </p>

<p> Based on the above results which Smart Phone’s camera captures are the best in your opinion? Let us know in the below comments section. </p>
<p> 27 Comments </p>
<p> the S4 stands out way above the rest of the crowd — the sharpness quality is there </p>
<p> Sony Xperia Z ´s picture quality like sharpness and true color is much better , i think . </p>
<p> These results are all basic results ! No photographer relies on them.All the three must be having editing options and before applying these it is not fair to compare these pics in isolation.However,as the pics as they are,it APPEARS that S4 is the one which wins albeit marginally so. </p>
<p> S4 beats the crap out of all camera’s . The color look so vibrant . Damnnnn . Hope i win the S4 Giveaway 😀 😛 </p>
<p> 1/ for daylight photo, HTC one wins 2/ for HDR, Samsung S4 wins 3/ For colour, S4 win So Galaxy S4 wins 2 over 3 tests for camera What about other tests? </p>
<p> Suggest us what other tests you want us to perform and we will add them right here. </p>
<p> Awesome samsung and song have very similar pic but anyways samsung has the best quality from all this three my personal vote samsung S4……..:) </p>
<p> S4 wins in all..But in HDR, it seems Xperia Z is better….So it luks like S4 tops followed by Xperia Z and then finally HTC one </p>
<p> Why partiality against htc one, photos taken by htc one are not in a correct way. I know htc quality. </p>
<p> We invite you to our studio where we captured these photos, we will redo the same test again with your eyes open, hope you would believe then. </p>
<p> PS : What on the earth would we get by showing partiality? Seriously you need to grow up and accept the facts and the results. </p>
<p> I think the Sony is defiantly last, the Last picture the HTC kills them both Handley but otherwise I prefer the S4 in most I would say the Samsung eeks out thewin on this one. although those tomatoes look so much better with the HTC in that last pic. All three look like they have amazing cameras. </p>

In the meanwhile, let’s check out on what are the new features which will be coming out in the upcoming new Jellybean 4.2.2 firmware. </p>
<p> a). %age Battery Icon Status: </p>

The One M10 also sports a physical home button on the front of the device but is slightly smaller when compared to the One A9. The company has also removed the front-facing stereo speakers and the HTC logo that was seen on all the earlier launched One M series devices. </p>

It may also include a UltraPixel front camera with OIS, NFC support and is expected to run on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow based HTC Sense UI 8.0 laid on top.

<p> HTC One M9 and M9+ to receive Android M update </p>
<p> As soon as the Google announced the Android M, HTC confirmed that One M9 and One M9Plus will be updated to the latest Android version. Jeff Gordon, Senior Global Online Communications Manager of HTC made it public through Twitter. </p>
<p> Good news! The HTC One M9 and One M9+ will be updated to Android M, with more devices to be announced soon. </p>
<p> Even though HTC listed only two devices, we can expect the latest Android M update for HTC One M8, One E9+ and other upcoming smartphones from HTC. Android M comes with a lot of improvements and customizations. The HTC One M9 and One M9Plus are launched earlier this year and run on Android 5.0 Lollipop out-of-the-box. </p>
<p> HTC One M9 comes with 5-inch FullHD (1080×1920) Super LCD3 display with a pixel density of 441ppi and has a Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection.

<p> HTC One M9 Plus, One E9 Expected to Launch on April 7th </p>
<p> If latest rumours are to be believed, HTC is expected to announce the launch of HTC One M9 Plus and HTC One E9 smartphone, next month. The company has reportedly started sending out invites for an event on April 8th. The event invite features the tagline ‘More than One’ and shows the back of the smartphone with a brushed metal dual-tone build and a duo-camera setup that bears a massive primary lens below the smaller depth-sensing lens. </p>
<p> Purported HTC One M9 Plus specs include QHD resolution (1,440 x 2,560 pixel) display, the chipset (on at least one version) will be a MediaTek MT6795T with an octa-core 64-bit processor and PowerVR 6200 GPU coupled with 3GB of RAM. The camera on the back will be a 20.7MP unit. However, there’s a secondary camera there too. The One M9 will come with 32GB of built-in storage. </p>
<p> The HTC One M9 Plus dummy visible in a leaked video and the One M9 Plus unit in the live images by a Chinese blog apps, certainly indicate the smartphone is slightly larger than the already launched One M9. </p>
<p> Talking about the One E9, according to the TENAA listing, the One E9 (listed as HTC E9pw) will pack an octa-core 64-bit Mediatek MT6795 SoC clocked at 2GHz and 3GB of RAM. Upfront, it is listed to feature a 5.5-inch Quad-HD (1440×2560 pixels) display and include a 20-megapixel rear camera with a big camera lens that appears very unconventional in the images. </p>

According to Bloomberg, the HTC One M9 will boast a 20-megapixel rear camera. That marks a departure from the so-called ultrapixel camera on the M8. </p>
<p> Earlier: HTC One M9 (Hima) Specifications leaked via Benchmark – Details Date – Dec 30, 2014 An alleged Antutu benchmark for the rumored M9 (possibly called the HTC Hima) has surfaced. According to the AnTuTu benchmark, HTC’s newest phone will feature a 5-inch display with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels, Qualcomm’s octa-core 64-bit Snapdragon 810 processor, a 20.7-megapixel rear-facing camera, a 13-megapixel front-facing camera, 3GB of RAM and Android 5.0.1 Lollipop. Earlier leaks also suggested that the new device will have a 2,840 mAh battery although this benchmark does nothing to confirm or deny this rumour. </p>
<p> Earlier: HTC Hima (One M9) will be available in grey, silver, and gold colour variant – Report Date – Dec 16,2014 According to @upleaks, the new HTC flagship handset Hima (One M9) will be available in three color variants: grey, silver, and gold. The One (M8) was also available in exactly the same color versions at launch, with others (i.e red and blue) introduced later on. @upleaks also says that he can “confirm” that the screen of the Hima is a 5-inch 1080p one, not a 5.2-inch or 5.5-inch one, as some rumors wanted us to believe. </p>
<p> The specs of the alleged new HTC phone were revealed by Upleaks on Twitter. It added that the rumored new phone was codenamed “Hima.” </p>
<p> Earlier: According to the post, the HTC One M9 or as @upleaks calls it, HTC Hima, will have Snapdragon 810 as its processor. It will have a 5-inch display with FHD resolution. It will also have a 13 megapixel or UltraPixel 4MP front camera on board, coupled with a 20.7 megapixel main camera. </p>
<p> In another tweet, it announced that HTC is currently working on the new RE Camera 2 which has the codename “GC2” but it is unlikely that the RE Camera will be launched with the new HTC Hima. It will also allegedly come with 3GB of RAM and a VoLTE/CA/LTE connection. The phone is also likely to get a new Android 5.0 Lollipop update and Sense 7.0. It will also have a 2,840mAh battery, according to the leaked specs. </p>
<p> Another tweet from @upleaks adds that the new phone “will be coming to all major [carriers] in the US.” It said that the device is already being tested at these carriers’ laboratories. </p>
<p> Earlier: A report has appeared in China claiming to have details on the specs for the HTC One M9. We have already heard some substantial rumours about the Samsung Galaxy S6, Sony Xperia Z4 and Xiaomi Mi5 so far, and now it’s the turn of the HTC next flagship. According to the report, the One M9 will come with the feature a 5.5-inch display with a 2K/QHD resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. </p>
<p> Report also claims it would be equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 chipset and 3GB RAM. The mention of Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 instead of the Snapdragon 810 does seem a bit weird as flagships are expected to use the Snapdragon 810 chip next year, and Qualcomm has already claimed that the chip will be ready for devices by early next year. </p>
<p> HTC will use 4MP UltraPixel sensor that was also used in One M8 flagship smartphone. According to the Chinese report, the One M9 would feature a 16MP rear camera with optical image stabilization. The One M9 will supposedly pack a 3500mAh capacity battery. One M9 will come with Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box. </p>
<p> If the sources of the Chinese website are to be believed, HTC might drop the BoomSound branding on its next flagship smartphone. HTC has apparently partnered with premium Audio brand Bose for the audio on One M9.The report also mentions about a “Prime’ variant of the One M9. No other details regarding the model have been provided though. We had heard rumours about a One M8 Prime earlier this year that was allegedly going to feature a Snapdragon 805 chipset and a Quad-HD display. </p>
<p> HTC has started rolling out the Eye Experience with Android 4.4.4 KitKat update for its One (M8), for the users in India recently. HTC had brought the Eye Experience update with Android 4.4.4 for One (M8) in Europe, last month. </p>
<p> Last week, HTC had officially announced the Desire 620 in Taiwan. The smartphone will come in 2 variants: the Desire 620 and the Desire 620GDesire 620 features LTE connectivity and a 64-bit quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor clocked at 1.2 GHz whereas Desire 620G doesn’t support LTE and is powered by a 1.3 GHz octa-core MediaTek MT6592 processor. </p>

<p> HTC One Max Officially Announced with 5.9-inch Display, Fingerprint Sensor – Specs & Details </p>
<p> The HTC One Max Android phablet is officially announced, just a day after the actual specs were all leaked through a retail packaging. And all the leaked specs were all true, with the One Max having a 5.9-inch touchscreen, Snapdragon 600 processor but the pricing of the device is not known yet. Running the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean OS, the device comes with an Ultrapixel camera with the LED flash on the rear side, while there is a 2.1-megapixel front facing camera too included. Check below for all the specifications of the HTC One Max. </p>
<p> HTC One Max Official Specifications </p>
<p> 5.9 inch (Super LCD 3), Full HD display at 373 ppi </p>
<p> UltraPixel rear camera with LED Flash, BSI Sensor and Optical Image Stabilization ,F2.0 aperture and 28 mm lens </p>
<p> 2.1-megapixel front facing camera </p>
<p> Connectivity: 3G HSPA+ up to 42 Mbps, WiFi 802.11 a/ac/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 with aptX codec, DNLA, MHL, GPS with GLONASS, NFC </p>
<p> 3300 mAh Battery </p>
<p> Earlier: </p>
<p> A major disappointment in the list is the processor, where we were expecting a Snapdragon 800 processor but in the end, can see the Snapdragon 600 clocking at 1.7 GHz. The pricing that we are getting to see is NT$23,900 (USD 814, INR 49,720), which is quite a lot for what is being offered. </p>
<p> Earlier: Oct 7th 2013 by Chetan Bhawani The HTC One Max phablet again made an appearance in a few leaked live photos where it was wearing the Verizon tag, and the sources did claim that there was a removable back cover in place along with a fingerprint sensor on the back. The rest of the rumors are still the same, where one is expecting a Snapdragon 800 SoC processor, a 6-inch display with the 1080p resolution and the same HTC One camera with the 4-megapixel Ultrapixel technology lens. </p>
<p> The phone is expected to be made official in the coming week or two. </p>
<p> Earlier: Sep 16th 2013 by Chetan Bhawani More clearer photos of the HTC One Max have come out, and it’s again through Weibo, and it clearly shows the Fingerprint Scanner and a lot more things, with the specifications too. So, just like what was being expected and leaked before, is what you are actually going to see in the One Max. The HTC One Max 8088 is going to come with a 5.9 inch screen with the 1980 x 1080 pixels screen resolution, and there would be a 1.7 GHz processor (we haven’t been able to see the chipset, whether a Snapdragon S4 Pro or a Snapdragon 800, as we had found both in the different rumors), 2GB RAM and a 5-megapixel camera which could be the ultrapixel one. </p>
<p> 16GB of onboard storage is what is being shown, and the battery capacity is 3300 mAh. And as expected, it would be the new Android 4.3 version that the device would come with. The pricing is expected to be around $800, and the expected launch is around October 2013, and we might have to wait for the Android KitKat based Nexus device for the One Max to become official. </p>
<p> The HTC One Max is being rumored a lot, but the latest leaks show a very interesting feature which was introduced by Apple in the iPhone 5S – the Fingerprint scanner. The scanner though doesn’t take it’s place on the front button area but it lies below the camera lens on the rear side with a squarish design which might have just the single purpose. </p>
<p> The One Max is codenamed the HTC 8088 and it is expected to come with a 5.9 inch full HD display, and as the leaked screenshots suggest, there would be the GSM and LTE support in it. The internal powering is expected to be 2.3GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor along with 2GB of RAM and the camera is the UltraPixel one, which was introduced in the company’s flagship HTC One smartphone earlier this year. </p>
<p> The screenshots even suggest that we might be seeing the new HTC Sense UI in the Android 4.3 KitKat version that was recently announced by Google, and we might see that officially along with the announcement of the Nexus 5 device. </p>
<p> It won’t be a long wait before we get to see this device officially announced, but that shouldn’t come before the Nexus 5 entry, we guess. </p>
<p> Earlier: Sep 14th, by Pradeep Neela HTC is firing all possible guns to show some decent Sales numbers when it comes to its Smartphones shipment and adding to the same, HTC is almost there with its new upcoming smartphone which will be dubbed as HTC On MAX. Despite Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone being one of the highest selling device as of now, it seems like HTC too is trying hard to counter with the new device launch. HTC has managed to get some substantial amount of attention when it comes to High End Polished smartphone, now all HTC need to do is to push out the new smartphones regularly. In the latest, HTC is planning to come up with a new smartphone to fight against the upcoming Galaxy Note 3 smart phablet which was announced in Berlin few days back. Let’s check out on what are the specs and features of this new smartphone from HTC, dubbed as HTC One MAX. </p>
<p> Specs & Features: With 5.9inches of Screen Size, will be coming up with the Jellybean 4.3 Android OS which will be rolling out shortly. Apart from 1080p of Full HD Display, this device also comes with 2.3GHz of Snapdragon 800 Processor and with ultra Pixel camera with 3000mAH of battery power. This phablet is also pegged to come up with the Boom Sound Speakers along with the thin bezel. We have summarized the specs and features below. Whne compared with the likes of Galaxy Note 3, this device seems to be pretty much the same in terms of specs. </p>
<p> Bluetooth 4.0 LE, </p>
<p> HTC One Max will be seen somewhere around September – October 2013. We will keep you posted as in when we get any details. The pricing of HTC One Max is pegged to be around $550 – $600 and will be launched in South East Asia. </p>

<p> If the HTC One Max is going to compete with the Note 3, then it needs better or similar hardware to the Note 3. The only advantage that Max has is the camera and the slightly larger screen size. I have the Note 2. I would have definitely been more intrigued if the Max has an micro SD slot and 3G of RAM. I hope that it has the Quad core processor also. Deal breaker for me when I found out the Samsung Mega has a 1.5 GHz dual processor. The removable battery would have been good, however, I prefer just a larger capacity battery in the range of 4000mAH. It is a hassle to change battery because you have to take off the case also. Too many steps. I found out a great way to preserve battery life, one can turn off the mobile data as well as your wifi, Bluetooth, GPS. You can make phone calls and still receive word text. You won’t be able to get SMS text such as picture mail and group text. However, you will get an alert. At that point, turn on your mobile data to fetch those SMS as well as emails. </p>
<p> Here is hoping HTC and Motorola can do well and challenge Samsung so they ALL will innovate. </p>
<p> That is where HTC failed to provide what was being expected. They came up with the Snapdragon 600 boosting, unlike the Snapdragon 800 and also there’s a 3300 mAh battery, although that isn’t any less because even the Note 3 has a 3200 mAh battery but yes the draining speed would depend on several factors. And for the camera, I have to tell you that the 13MP camera of the Note 3 or the LG G2 are way better than the Ultrapixel shooter from the HTC One, and that same Ultrapixel camera is being brought in the HTC One Max. </p>
<p> Note 3 is far more better..no matter how much Htc tries to increase their screen size they can just not compete with the galaxy note series. </p>
<p> I also wish HTC luck on their new phone. I will like the size if the overall dimensions are not too large. I hope they include a SD slot and removable battery. With a phone like this, it needs to have more portable computer functionality like the Note 2 & 3. I would love to see HTC jump into a strong position for the future again. No more locked down misses like the One. </p>
<p> I love my HTC EVO 4G LTE but my phone leaves the charger at 0400 and I’m out of juice at noon. I’d rather carry an extra battery than my auxiliary battery pack. </p>
<p> Whew. The thing is… When I see that 3gb RAM by the note3. That’s it. I gotta have it. …and the Samsung galaxy series devices are just so easy to root. All the “software gimmicks” that people complain about. Swoosh – gone lol </p>
<p> what HTC lacks is software gimmicks that Samsung has like that of gesture controls. </p>
<p> Good luck to HTC they are definitely wondering into uncharted territory. This category is owned by Samsung for 2yrs now. All other participants are seriously rookies and so are their products. Nothing will compare to the Galaxy Note 3 from October 2013 to July 2014. </p>

<p> HTC One Mini 2 Official, with 4.5-inch display, 13 MP camera – Specs, Details </p>
<p> HTC has made its One mini 2 official and has introduced it today. The HTC One mini 2 comes with a 4.5 inch display and is the sibling or the mini version of the HTC One (M8) that was released couple of months earlier. HTC on its blog mentioned that, this device is compact elegance with advance features tightened in to 4.5 inch display. </p>
<p> The HTC One mini 2 has a smaller display of 4.5 inch HD display and will be run on Android 4.4 KitKat Operating system, with Sense 6 and HTC BlinkFeed on top. The device is powered by a 1.2 GHz quad core Snapdragon 400 processor which is a downfall from the 2.3 GHz processor that we have seen in the company’s flagship model and also packs a 2100 mAh battery on the back. </p>
<p> The HTC One mini 2 comes with a 13 MP camera on the rear unlike the HTC One (M8) that had dual camera in the back for depth capturing of the images. The same 5 MP front facing camera has been used for high quality video calling. The handset is equipped with a microSD card slot to extend the memory and it also has the connectivity of the NFC. </p>
<p> Peter Chou, CEO of HTC, said that the HTC One mini 2 is the latest member of the award winning family that comes with advanced features and its size and tapered edges will fit perfectly into the pocket or purse, sitting nicely on the palm to feel it better and easier to use. The device will also feature, HTC BoomSound, HTC Zoe Highlights and Zoe sharing app that allows the users to create, remix and share the videos and photos taken from its camera. </p>
<p> The HTC One mini 2 will be arriving in EMEA and Asia starting next month and will be available in Gunmetal Gray, Amber Gold and Glacial Silver colour options. The availability of the device may differ by county and region. </p>

<p> HTC One Mini banned in UK for Infringing Nokia’s Patents, HTC One could follow </p>
<p> The Taiwanese manufacturer HTC has got a big blow yet again after seeing its sales getting low already, as a London Court has ordered to ban the sales of the HTC One Mini smartphone in the UK markets. According to the court, the HTC One Mini and the HTC One were infringing Nokia’s European Patent number 0998024. The court decided against HTC’s wish of getting an injunction and the ruling with financial damages to pay Nokia. </p>
<p> The court has ordered HTC to stop the sales of the HTC One Mini (we wonder whether that would really matter with the pitiful number of sales this device is making) in the UK but it hasn’t decided about the HTC One already, and thus the sales would be allowed until the result of the appeal from HTC comes out. </p>
<p> The judgement from the UK court Judge, said: </p>
<p> “In my judgement, in the case of One, the balance comes down in favour of granting a stay. The potential harm to HTC outweighs that of Nokia, the One has been on the market for some time and the impact of HTC’s apparent lack of contingency planning is less significant. In the case of the One Mini, the balance comes down in the favour of refusing a stay. In this case the potential harm is more evenly weighted, but importantly the phone was launched much more recently and HTC designed and launched it at a time when HTC knew it was facing a claim for infringement of the patent and apparently without making any contingency plans,” </p>
<p> The reason why the result was more inclined towards the HTC One Mini was this: HTC launched its One Mini phone in August 2013. This phone contains a Qualcomm WTR1605L chip and a Broadcom BCM4334 chip. HTC has revealed that the decision to include the Broadcom BCM-4334 chip in this phone was taken on 2 January 2013 (i.e. about eight months after Nokia started the German proceedings). </p>
<p> For the HTC One Mini users who already purchased one in the UK will be still be able to get the service from the HTC service centers, but the sales are going to stop from December 6th. The HTC One sales too would follow very soon. </p>

<p> HTC One, One Mini Android 4.4 KitKat Update in Canada Coming Soon – Begin Certification Testing </p>
<p> The HTC One and HTC One Mini users in Canada will now get to taste the KitKat flavor in their devices very soon, as the KitKat version of OS is sent for the certification and all the six network providers in Canada have begun testing the OS update – Bell, Rogers TELUS, Virgin Mobile, Wind and SaskTel. Out of these, Rogers has already started the certification of the Android 4.4 update for the HTC One Mini. </p>
<p> As the testing has already started, the certification too won’t take long and we will be seeing the actual rollout of the Android KitKat update to these devices very soon, and that could be in a week or two. The providers in the US were faster in sending the updates to the HTC One users, and we expect the network providers in Canada to take around the same time to send the update to the users. Once the certification is done, the roll out of the KitKat OS will be done via the Over-the-air option, and as the company had earlier said, the HTC One would be the first device from the company to receive the update, thus the HTC One Mini users might still have to wait for at least a week more, after the HTC One update is rolled out. </p>
<p> The Android 4.4 update for both the devices will have the latest version of HTC Sense, i.e. version 5.5 which is said to be having a lot of improvements from the previous version, and this includes bug fixes, enhancements to the Blinkfeed and the Video highlights. We will be able to confirm the actual change log and list of features updated in the new OS version when it is pushed out to the devices after the certification is done. </p>
<p> For now, you can check the HTC Canada page to check out the live status of the update for the HTC One through the different network providers. </p>

<p> 25+ HTC One Tips and Tricks – Hidden Options & Useful Features </p>
<p> We have been using the HTC One from the past two weeks and have been pretty impressed with this Smart Phone. In this video we are going to share you some of the most useful Tips & Tricks which are useful if you own this Smart Phone. </p>
<p> Hide Unused Tabs in Phone App </p>
<p> The Phone app on the HTC One can sometimes make you confuse because of the five different tabs which you get. The first one being “Call History” followed by “Phone”, “Favorites”, “People” and “Groups”. Now there is a hidden option which allows you to hide those tabs which you are not going to use regularly. Tap on the Settings and you need to next tap on “Edit Tabs”, here you need to uncheck all those tabs which you don’t want to display. </p>
<p> Capture Screenshots </p>
<p> On the HTC One you can capture the screenshots pretty easily and there are actually two different ways to doing that. You can perform the following two combinations at the same time and the screenshots would be captured and stored to your Phone Memory. 1. Power Button + Home Button [Faster] 2. Power Button + Volume Down Key [Slower] </p>
<p> Multi Tasking Switch </p>
<p> If you would like to access the applications which are running in the background or if you would like to switch between the applications then there is a simple shortcut for the same. Just Double Tap on the Home button and it should show you a new window with a total of 9 applications which were recently accessed. This is a pretty useful option because there are times when you would like to access these apps and this shortcut is something which you need to remember. </p>
<p> Tap Notifications Bar </p>
<p> Tapping once on the top of your notifications bar would take you to the top of the page where you are on. You may be in your Applications page or your Blinkfeed app page where you are reading the content and you suddenly want to scroll to the top of the page, you just have to Tap on the top of the notifications bar. This at times is useful because sometimes while reading some content, you keep scrolling and end up to many folds down and scrolling up would take a lot of time. </p>
<p> Customizing LED Flash Notifications </p>
<p> Its pretty easy to change the notifications flash on your Smart Phone. This is possible by going to the settings and changing the default settings. Tap on Settings > Display, gestures & buttons > Notification Flash option. Here you can select all the services for which you wish to Enable or Disable the notification flash service. Uncheck and you are done. </p>
<p> Two Fingers Scrolling Contacts </p>
<p> If you have hundreds of contacts then its generally preferable if you search / scroll content in the alphabetical order. By default if you start scrolling the contacts then its hard to find the right contacts quickly because of the long list and this is when you need to start scrolling with two fingers. You will have to use both your fingers to scroll, following which you would find the alphabets appearing which can help you in easily sorting and selecting the right contact. </p>
<p> Magnifying Glass </p>
<p> Whenever you would like to either copy paste some data on your phone, then its very easy because you just have to long press and the option to select shows up. But the issue is that its hard to read what you are trying to select and that is when the option of “magnifier” comes up. Tap on the Settings > Accessibility > “Show Magnifier” > Check Yes > Tap the anchor to enlarge text in magnifier. This is enabled following which whenever you try to select some text, its magnified and easy to not only read but also select. </p>
<p> Touch to Capture Photos </p>
<p> The HTC One comes with a amazing camera which can be used to focus perfectly before you capture the objects. The best part is that when you tap on the screen you can select the object to focus and everything else in the background would get blurred. Again, that’s a feature which you would generally find on the DSLR’s camera’s and surprisingly this is available on this Phone. But if you prefer capturing photos with a tap on the screen, then you can enable that option through the Settings area in the Camera Application. Tap on Settings > Shutter Option > “Touch to Capture” > Check ON. This would enable this feature following which you can capture a photo by just tapping on the screen. </p>
<p> Smart Volume Rockers </p>
<p> Before we start discussing about them we would like to inform that these are not just the normal buttons which are useful for Increasing or Decreasing the volume and you can use them for multiple purpose hence we call them the Smart Volume Rockers. If your Phone came with the option of Flash Light / Torch Light Application then you can use this option to Increase or Decrease the Intensity. Along with that you can use the same to Increase or Decrease the Volume of your Television if you are using the Remote App. </p>
<p> Fast Boot Mode </p>
<p> This is a very interesting feature which you need to enable on your Smart Phone, because its one of those options which once enabled you would be proud to show it to your friends. Its the Fast Boot mode which boots up your Smart Phone super fast. Go to Settings > Power > “Fast Boot” > Check YES. Once done, give a try and it works. </p>
<p> Force Reboot </p>
<p> The HTC One comes without the option to remove the battery which means that its hard to reboot the phone whenever it gets hanged. Even though this happens rarely, but in case your Phone has got stuck and you would like to reboot the phone, then the only option is Force Reboot which can be achieved by the option of a shortcut which is Pressing & Holding the Power button for 10 seconds following which it reboots the device. </p>
<p> Enabling Power Saver </p>
<p> The next important tip would be enabling the power saving feature following which the battery would extend for a longer period. This would lower your CPU frequency, decrease the screen brightness, turn off the vibration feedback and also disable the Data connection when screen is off which would save up your battery and ensure you can use the device for a longer period. </p>
<p> Secure SMS Messages </p>
<p> Generally you would like to Hide some of your SMS Messages from everyone and for this you need to download some applications from the Play Store, but in this case the HTC One comes with a option of securing your Important or Private SMS from everyone. You will have to setup a password first before using this feature. Go to Messages > General > Settings > Password > Enter Password. Once the password is set, you can move back to the main messages application screen. Long press on the Message and you would get the option to “Move to Secure Box”. In order to read them again, you need to tap on the Top left on this screen, tap on the drop down option which says “Messages” > “Secure” > following which you would be asked to enter the password and you are done. </p>
<p> Increase Burst Mode Captures </p>
<p> The burst mode feature comes with 20 photos capture by default and this can be increased to 99, but the option of which is to be set up manually. You need to open up the Camera application and then tap on the settings option following which you would get a option which says “Continuous Shooting”, tap on that which would take you to another option which says “Limit to 20 frames”. Uncheck on that option and you would get the access to capture 99 photos in one go. </p>
<p> Hiding Apps </p>
<p> This is a option which is sometimes useful because you may have downloaded many applications which are not useful on a day to day basis and you would like to probably hide them. That is when this option is useful. Just tap on the settings options in the applications page following which you would get the option to “Hide Apps”, tap on the same and then you would be shown with a page to select all the applications which you would like to hide. </p>
<p> Easy Camera Switch </p>
<p> If you would like to Switch from the Back Camera to the Front Camera, you don’t have to go through the settings or tapping onto any options but just have to swipe your fingers on the screen. This is yet very simple but useful feature if you would like to quickly switch the camera’s. </p>
<p> Enable Car Mode </p>
<p> This is a feature which is generally not used by most people but its one of the best feature you should be using. Generally when you drive your car and would like to access some of the basic features of your phone, then its hard to scroll down the right content and also access those applications. This is when the Car Mode comes in use, because its going to show you the options which you generally use while driving in a better display, which is not only easy to reach and select but also shown in larger font. This means that you get the Navigation, Dialer, Music & Speak features / apps in a different UI which are easy to use while driving. </p>
<p> Hope you have found all the above tips useful and if you think we missed any, let us know in the comments section and we would be glad to share them with our readers. </p>

<p> HTC One X10 with Helio P10 SoC & 4,000mAh Battery Launched in Russia for $355 </p>
<p> Last year, HTC launched the high-end One X9 smartphone with Helio P10 SoC. This is the same processor that was also used in sub $150 smartphones. Recently, we have seen many rumors about its successor, HTC One X10. Now, the company has silently launched the HTC One X10 in Russia for RUB 19,990 (approx $355 / €335). The device comes in Black and Silver color options and will go on sale by the end of this month. Unlike the recently launched the U series smartphones that came with a glossy finish, the new One X10 comes with a unibody metal slab. </p>
<p> It sports a 5.5-inch Super LCD display with Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) offering a pixel density of 401 PPI. There is also a Corning Gorilla Glass protection on top. Under the hood, the One X10 still packed the 64-bit MediaTek Helio P10 octa-core processor that was first announced in 2015. The device includes 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. There is also a MicroSD card slot for technically expanding up to 2TB. The One X10 is a dual SIM dual standby device and offers 4G LTE support on both the SIM’s. </p>
<p> On the camera front, there is a 16MP autofocus rear camera with an aperture of f/2.0 and dual tone LED flash. The device also supports ‘Pro’ mode with manual settings that can capture in RAW mode. With the limitation of year’s old processor, the 16MP sensor can record videos only in Full HD resolution. For selfies, there is an 8MP fixed focus front camera with f/2.2 aperture and 86-degree wide-angle lens. The device runs on Android OS with the HTC Sense UI on top, but the company hasn’t mentioned about the specific version of the OS. </p>
<p> The One X10 also features a fingerprint sensor placed on the rear of the device. It can also be added as a shortcut for fastly accessing the camera app. Coming to the USP of the One X10, it is backed by a large 4,000mAH non0-removable battery with 5V/2A fast charging support. The company claims the battery on this device to give up to 25.5 hours of talk time and lasts up to 31 days in standby mode. Connectivity options include 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, GPS, GLONASS and Bluetooth 4.2. It also offers HTC BoomSound profiles for better audio experience. </p>
<p> There are two microphones for the active noise cancellation. The device measures 152.9 x 75.6 x 8.2 mm and weighs 175 grams. Soon the company will be launching the HTC Ocean, the third smartphone in the new U series. The images and few features of this upcoming device are already leaked. Coming to the One X10, there is no information about the launch of this new device in the other markets. </p>

<p> HTC One X10 with Metallic Body Leaked, to Launch at MWC 2017 </p>
<p> A few months back, the HTC One X10 and Desire 650 smartphones were spotted online for the first time. At that time, we don’t have any information apart from the naming. But in December 2016, the HTC One X10 specifications along with the expected pricing are revealed. In between this, the company also launched the HTC 10 Evo smartphone in India and later this month, HTC is also bringing the premium U Ultra smartphone with dual displays. Today, the upcoming HTC One X10 smartphone is listed on a Chinese site with much clearer images. Though there is no confirmation, it is expected to launch at the Mobile World Congress event that will be held in Barcelona from February 27th to March 2nd. </p>
<p> The One X10 will be the successor to the HTC One X9 which was launched in December 2015. It is rumored to come with a 5.5-inch display with Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) resolution. On the design front, the device packs an all-metal body with a protruding rear camera. We can also find the circular fingerprint sensor and the dual tone LED flash on the back. The volume rocker and power button are placed on the right edge of the One X10. While the One X9 came with Helio X10 chipset, its successor will be powered by the years old Helio P10 SoC. The leaked specifications suggest the device to include 3GB of RAM and might come with 32GB or 64GB or internal storage. </p>
<p> On the camera front, it might sport a 16MP sensor on the rear and an 8MP camera on the front for selfies and video calls. The device will be running on the latest Android 7.0 Nougat based HTC Sense UI. However, we can’t expect it to feature the Sense Companion that is included in the U Ultra and U Play smartphones. Since all these specifications are yet to be officially confirmed, take this a pinch of salt. Last year’s One X9 is backed by a 3,000mAh non-removable battery and is one of the very first devices to run on the Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. Currently, the One X9 is retailing at Rs. 21,990 and is available in Gold and Grey colors. </p>
<p> It will be launched in dual SIM and single SIM variants with 4G VoLTE support. The earlier leaks also suggested the HTC One X10 to cost less than 2000 Yuan (approx $290 / RS. 20,000) in China. While there is no news about the HTC 11, we might only be seeing the HTC One X10 at MWC. Apart from Samsung, all the major smartphones are also expected to unveil their latest smartphones at the MWC 2017 event. Instead of Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus, Samsung will be unveiling the Galaxy Tab S3 with S Pen support. On the other, LG and Huawei will be unveiling LG G6 and Huawei P10 smartphones respectively. </p>

<p> is it HTC ONEx update 4.1.1 onwards coming for Indian HTC onex mobiles ?????????????? </p>
<p> Got the Z (white) absolutely love it! No expandable memory for the HTC is it’s #1 flaw. </p>
<p> I own Xperia Z and its completely satisfying. Battery life comes for 1.5 days with regular usage (3G always switched on except night, hear songs for 1 hr, play games for 30 min, periodic checking of mails, FB and Whatsapp). You can see the difference with and without the Stamina mode. </p>
<p> @Shawn, I’m at first to give you “yes” to the missing memory card, but at a close reading, then “NO”, because the HTC have a total memory of 64Gb, while the Z “only” can have up to 48Gb – so what’s the problem – none. I’m not a HTC fan boy, but Samsung, so what I’m missing in both, are the replaceable battery! </p>

<p> HTC Rolls Out Android 7.0 Nougat Update for HTC One A9 in Europe </p>
<p> At the time of HTC One A9 launch in 2015, the company promised to release latest Android updates in just 15 days after hitting the Nexus devices. But with the Android 7.0 Nougat update, the company missed the 15 days deadline to release the latest Android update for the HTC One A9. Earlier this year, the One A9 devices in the U.S started getting the latest Android updates, and now in March, the company started rolling out OTA update for the European One A9 devices. </p>
<p> As the roll-out started now, it will take few days to pop-up on your devices. If there is no notification about the Android 7.0 Nougat based HTC Sense UI update, the user can manually check by opening Settings > About Device > System Updates. Before updating to the latest Android OS, the device needs to at least 50% of battery life. With the Nougat update, the device now includes new features like split screen multitasking, new animations, rich notification, and few other changes. </p>
<p> It comes with a 5-inch AMOLED display wth Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels) resolution. Under the hood is the Snapdragon 617 octa-core processor coupled with Adreno 405 GPU. As it packs 3GB of RAM, we expect it to smoothly handle the multitasking. The device comes with 32GB of onboard storage that can be further expanded using the MicroSD card slot. In the camera department, there is a 13MP rear camera with f/2.0 aperture and Optical Image Stabilization (OIS). For selfies, there is a 4MP ultra pixel front camera with f/2.0 aperture. </p>
<p> Both the cameras can record video only up to Full HD resolution at 30fps.However, the 2,150mAh non-removable battery is quite small considering the huge battery capacities in the newly launched smartphones. It also comes with active noise cancellation mic for better call quality. tHe physical home button on the front also comes integrated with a fingerprint sensor. It comes with a metal built body and weighs 143 grams. </p>

<p> HTC’s New Midrange Smartphone Pops up on GeekBench </p>
<p> Although HTC has not been shipping as many devices as it used to, it is not giving up hope and is getting ready to launch a smartphone. An upcoming device from HTC has been spotted on the Geekbench website with the model number 2Q7A100. There is no information on the actual name or official launch date but the listing of the handset on the website has revealed little information of the same. </p>
<p> This upcoming smartphone will be powered with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 710 processor and will be coupled with 6GB of RAM. The company might launch other storage options also which we are not sure of. Furthermore, it will come with Android 9 Pie operating system out of the box and might get further updates when available. Since Android Q is in Beta we might expect the stable update to be out in few more months. </p>
<p> It will be coming with eight core with a clocking speed of 1.7 GHz and it will be interesting what kind of display HTC will be using on the device. Since it is a mid-range device we might expect the handset to be coming with a dual camera sensor on the back and a selfie camera on the front. The device was listed on 11th of this month and we can expect more leaks to come in the further days. </p>
<p> Not long ago we have seen HTC announcing that it will be rolling out Android 9 Pie operating system to three of its device, namely HTC U12+, HTC U11+ and HTC U11 in the coming few weeks. Do you own any of the devices from HTC? Are you planning to get one of these devices? Comment in the section below and stay tuned to Android Advices for similar news and updates. </p>

<p> HTC to cut-down component orders upto 30% due to lower than expected sales of One M9 </p>
<p> One of the HTC’s supply chain companies in Taiwan claimed the orders of One M9 component are to be cut by nearly 30%. The cut-down process was not due to the lack of supply of components, but to lower than expected demand for the One M9 in the market. The above said sources explain because the lesser sales are due to many similarities between the One M9 and its predecessor. HTC declined to comment on these market reports. </p>
<p> The Hardware of the device is also just comparable to the flagship devices from other manufacturers. HTC also faces stiff competition from Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, ZTE, Lenovo and Coolpad for the entry-level and mid-range smartphones. </p>
<p> But for now HTC’s shares on Taiwan Stock Exchange dropped by NT$ 1.50 (US$ 0.05) to close at NT$ 103.5 (US$ 3.4) on 20 May, this is the lowest prices for HTC in the last 10 years. Even though the launch of One M9 is in April, HTC had seen the worst April in the last six years, where the revenues falling to 33% from March 2015 and 39% when compared to April 2014. </p>
<p> There are other versions of One M9 like One M9+ and One E9+ which have better specifications than the original M9. The One E9+ is the plastic variant of the One M9+. Though we cannot 100% believe the information from supply chains is to be accurate, the sales and share prices indicating it to be true. At least from now on HTC have to make a lot of revamps in its design and the line-up of devices. </p>

<p> HTC U Ocean with Glossy Finish Spotted in a New Leaked Image </p>
<p> A couple of months back, HTC launched the U Ultra and U Play smartphones. The device came with a complete glossy finish making them fingerprint magnets. Till now, there is no official information about the HTC U, codenamed HTC Ocean. This will be the third device in the new U-series. However, we have been seeing the rumors about the HTC U Ocean from early 2017. HTC U Ultra is the company’s latest flagship device, but that came with Snapdragon 821 SoC. Even the company has officially denied launching the HTC 11, the successor to last year’s HTC 10. </p>
<p> Now, the reliable leakster, Evan Blass has leaked the image of the HTC U. As seen with the other U-series smartphones, the upcoming HTC U also comes with a glossy finish. It sports curved glass on the front and back with rounded edges. The earlier leaks suggested the device to come with touch sensitive frame which will be called Edge Sense. The user can control the device by just swiping on the frame of the device. Beneath the display is the physical home button that comes integrated with a fingerprint sensor. </p>
<p> The rear camera protrudes out of the back body and comes accompanied with dual tone LED flash. With the HTC U Ultra, the company introduced the secondary display placed on top of the primary display. It looks similar to the secondary ticker display o the LG V10 and V20 smartphones. The same feature is now missing on the HTC U. The device will come powered by the Snapdragon 835 SoC, the most powerful smartphone processor available in the market. It will be running on the latest Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box with the Sense UI 9 laid on top. </p>
<p> We might be seeing both the Google Assistant and the HTC Sense Companion on the device. The HTC U features a 5.5-inch display with Quad HD (2560 x 1440 pixels resolution). We hope the company provides Gorilla Glass protection on front and back of this glossy finished device. The device is said to come with 64GB and 128GB storage options along with a MicroSD card slot for further expansion of storage. In the camera department, the HTC U sports a 12MP Sony IMX362 sensor on the rear and a 16MP Sony IMX351 sensor on the front. </p>

More than a competitor to Google Assistant, the Sense Companion also comes integrated with the services from Google Assistant. The devices come with a curved glass that has reflective nature, which the company calls as a Liquid Surface body. Another big change in the U series smartphones is the lacks of 3.5mm Audio port. </p>

<p> HTC One US Models getting Android 4.3 Update Soon, after HTC One Max Launch </p>
<p> The U.S. based HTC One models that came under the different network providers, are soon going to receive the Android 4.3 update, which would be the last Android Jelly Bean update, as the next one would be Android 4.4 KitKat which is to be officially launched by Google very soon. A report from HTC Insider said that the US based HTC One models are soon going to get the 4.3 update, and there might be update for the HTC One S and the HTC Evo LTE version. </p>
<p> This would come as a good news for the HTC’s flagship device owners in the U.S. because there was no Android 4.2 update sent to these devices and that would be skipped, to directly send the Android 4.3 update, and this is probably going to be the same for the HTC Droid DNA too. </p>
<p> The HTC One in the U.S. is available through four service providers, i.e. T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and apart from these, there’s a developer version too, which is the unlocked one and none of these have got even the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean update. Unlike the international version of the HTC One, there won’t be HTC Sense 5.5 and it would be the HTC Sense 5 coming along with the 4.3. </p>
<p> The good news is that once the HTC One Max is announced and launched, the HTC One and the Butterfly S international versions would see the Sense 5.5 and the Android 4.3 in it, and this indicates that the One Max is coming soon into the scene. What is clear is that the HTC One S and the HTC Evo LTE version on Sprint network won’t be getting the update. </p>
<p> We already know about the 4.3 update and the enhancements, updates that are coming in that version, but with the Sense 5.5 we can see some enhancements and additions to the HTC Zoe feature, and something in the home screen areas, along with the bug fixes. But we cannot be sure already because there’s no official word about it. The TouchWiz from Samsung is easy to use but becomes laggy because of no updates to the resources, but the Sense has been quite wonderful with the intuitive features, as well as the design. </p>
<p> So, wait for the HTC One Max announcement if you wanted to see the Android 4.3 update on your device, or if you are actually looking for an upgrade to a better device, as the T6 is coming very soon. There’s no need to panic if other devices around are getting the Android 4.2 update and then the 4.3, because HTC is skipping that version. </p>

<p> Coming to the specifications of HTC T328w smartphone, its more or less looks likes HTC one S and its bbit smaller featuring 4 inches Super WVGA display screen. The good thing is this maybe the first handset by HTC which comes with pre installed Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating system. So now spotting various devices coming pre installed with Android 4.0 and its good to see such devices coming out as they avoid the heck of updating to Android 4.0 and this may bring various errors and forces closes to your devices. </p>
<p> The handset will come out with Sense 4.0 user interface which is owned by HTC and includes internet access via Wi Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 3.0 for wireless file transfer and Beats Audio for pretty good sound clarity.

<p> Huawei and Honor won’t be receiving Android Updates After US ban </p>
<p> The conflict between Huawei and the US has been going on from more than a year now and after the ban imposed by the US Government on all the Huawei Smartphones, now Google has also officially suspended bunnies with the Chinese OEM. From now on there won’t be any update or support to the Huawei and Honor smartphones and the Tech Giant has discontinued any services that include its hardware, software or any other kind of technology. </p>
<p> As we know Huawei is the second largest smartphone brand in the world after the South Korean Giant. Even after not being in the US, Huawei has also overtaken Apple recently. With the move from Google, Huawei will definitely be affected by the ban and will also mean that Huawei smartphone will not be having access to the Google Play store losing all its access to other Google serves and applications. </p>
<p> According to Bloomberg Report, Huawei is said to have stockpiled chips and other important components which will be allowing it to run for the next three months since the chipmakers, Qualcomm, Intel, Xilinx, and Broadcom has also stopped supplying their products to Huawei until further notice. Huawei has also been preparing for this day and has designed its own chips for the smartphones and laptops </p>
<p> Trumps executive order to prohibit US businesses from using telecommunications equipment made by the companies which pose a risk for national security and made it clear that Huawei and its sub-brand Honor will not have access to the open source version of the AOSP also. What do you think about this ban on Huawei? Will it affect it in any way? Do you own any smartphone from Huawei or Honor?

<p> Huawei Ascend Mate Hands-on at the CES 2013 – Photos and Video </p>
<p> What do you call it? the king of Phablets? or a compressed tablet! Whatever you name it, Huawei is calling it the Ascend Mate which comes with a whooping 6.1 inch touchscreen and a gorgeous design. Although the large screen, the company couldn’t bring a 1080p display to it and the screen limits the display to 720p, which brings it to around 241 PPI. We spend a good time with the Ascend Mate and played around to check whether its worth the hype – and the thoughts would go both the ways. The display although vibrant and good, isn’t the best out there as there are better appealing displays with smaller screen sizes, but Huawei isn’t giving your hands or pockets a heavy weight to hold as the phablet still is quite light, thanks to the plasticky body of the Ascend Mate. </p>
<p> We initially criticized Huawei for not taking in mind, the size of the screen and the usability issues that could happen when someone wants to use the phone with a single hand. But they have taken care of it, with the Single-hand UI which would make the keyboard or phone keypad smaller and pushed to the particular side where your hand is trying to type. This is to tackle the problem of large screen where your single hand cannot reach at all the corners. </p>
<p> The Ascend Mate isn’t strong and heavy just externally, as it is power-packed by the Hi-Silicon 1.5 GHz Quad-core processor and it runs the Android 4.1 Jelly Bean OS within itself. Being almost 10mm in thickness, 9.9mm to be precise, the Ascend Mate isn’t really heavy at 198 gm and there’s no lag we could see while multitasking on the phablet. And just like Samsung, the makers of the Ascend Mate are integrating their own tweaks to the software to make it more interesting and user-friendly for the users. These tweaks and additions include the Guiding Wizard which he heard about, from one of Huawei’s representatives there but we couldn’t find an actual demo of the same, although they say its an augmented reality combo bringing high-speed look up for the places and word translation through smart reading. </p>
<p> Huawei Ascend Mate Hands-on Video </p>
<p> There’s something called as the Emotional UI that this phablet has got, which would make itself understand your need, and help you adjust a lot of options, and even the entire settings area in the notification panel can be changed. And surprise, there’s no Play Store in the Ascend Mate. We searched for it through many ways, but in vain. And what you finally find is an App Installer that is located in the tools folder which does the similar job like the Play Store, so Huawei has attempted something like the Samsung App Store, something different from the Android Play Store which all phones come with, by default. </p>
<p> Overall the Android 4.1 looks pretty great with a few tweaks that we noticed, and you will have to see yourself using two hands together a few times as the Single hand UI won’t be useful everywhere, especially when you are playing games or trying to use any heavy full-screen apps in the landscape mode, and unless you have long fingers, you will need two hands for the easy usability. </p>
<p> Hands-on Photos: </p>
<p> The camera is another excellent improvement from Huawei’s side, as the capturing on the 8-megapixel Autofocus lens with the HDR looks pretty great and the video capturing is possible at 1080p HD quality, while this quality is supported only with the video playback as the actual display of the Ascend Mate is 720p. There’s even a front camera included in the Ascend Mate, decent enough at 1-megapixel for the video chatting. </p>
<p> One of the best and biggest specification in the list is the battery, which is a whooping 4050 mAh capacity one, leaping ahead of one of the best battery powered devices, the Galaxy Note II from Samsung which has a 3100 mAh battery. An hour of usage, multitasking, web browsing and camera capturing drained just around 9% of the battery, and we had not set any battery saving options so there’s a lot to expect from the battery of the Ascend Mate, and hope Huawei doesn’t disappoint in the long run. </p>
<p> We were very eager to find when the device would be available in the market, but the company says it is aiming an International launch and this is in talks with the US carriers, so we could be expecting this device to be shipped before the 2nd quarter of 2012, and only then the pricing can be confirmed. </p>

<p> Huawei slacked from SD Association & Wi-Fi Alliance </p>
<p> After all the drama going around Huawei, we have seen Microsoft removed Huawei laptops form its online stores and then Google also removed Huawei smartphones from the Android Enterprise. Now the Chinese OEM is removed from SD association and now will not be able to use MicroSD cards slots as well as MicroSD cards. As per the SD association, Huawei is removed in compliance with the US Executive order. We already know that Huawei is now offered 90-Day reprieve to settle its business with the US companies. </p>
<p> After getting removed from SD association, Huawei phones will not be able to used MicroSD card slots while the current Honor as well as Huawei phone won’t be affected. Recently we have seen Huawei introduced its own NM card option on its Huawei Mate 20 series which is the Nano-Memory card which is smaller than the MicroSD card that looks similar to the traditional microSD cards. This NM card is supported only the latest flagship phone from Huawei and in furture, we can expect it to be used by all range of Huawei phones. </p>
<p> From now on, Huawei will be making NM card as their standard feature for all its upcoming smartphones and make their own cards. Furthermore, we know that Huawei has been suspended from JEDEC that looks after the RAM and flash storage standards and the US-based Broadcomm that supplies Wi-Fi chips to Huawei has stopped its business with Huawei in compliance with Trumps Executive order. </p>
<p> Huawei might need to source its Wi-Fi chips from other companies or might have to make its own Wi-Fi chips instead. It is really going to be a tough period for Huawei after all these since they are going to loose accesses to most of the major tech companies and they have to make their own which might take a lot of time.

<p> How to Get Ice Cream Sandwich Features on your Android Phone </p>
<p> With the launch of Samsung Galaxy Nexus, the Google phone, it was the birth of Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, an update to their existing Android operating system. It brings the most awaited Android update we have a big list of enhancements and improvements added with Ice Cream Sandwich. Though the Ice Cream Sandwich update on your phone is not yet available and it could take few months when its officially arrives. </p>
<p> You would be interested to see many applications and tools from the developers have come to add makeovers on to your mobile phone look like the new Ice Cream Sandwich. Here are few of the apps and enhancements available on the web which can be added to your existing mobile phone – </p>
<p> Tip # 1 – Mobile Data Usage & Limit </p>
<p> The new Ice Cream Sandwich update introduces the option of “Data Usage”. When you are much worried about the carrier data usage then this utility on your Android phone is very much on to that. This feature on the Android OS allows users to set data usage cycle accordingly to warn users how much data limit they set for. The usage is noted down in day, weeks and month usage and this is must for the users who go with the limited data plans on their mobile phones. </p>
<p> Don’t worry if you are not on Ice Cream Sandwich as alternative of this to Android previous versions can be found. The data usage and limitations can be set on any of the Android mobile phone using the application named ‘3G Watchdog’ which is a free app and the paid app for it is named as ‘3G Watchdog Pro’ available at a price of $ 4. </p>
<p> 12 Comments </p>
<p> You can check out the ICS table listed on this blog for the info on the same. This article will help you in giving Ice Cream Sandwich looks for your Android Device. </p>
<p> The watch dog app is not capable of detecting the carrier data usage. What I mean is that if the reception from the network service provider is stronger than your wifi reception, it takes over the network without you detecting it. So you will get a hefty bill at the end of the month if you have a limited data usage. The I-phone user does not have to worry about this as the wifi can be set as the default for data usage. I am using GalaxyS2, so the only way to solve the problem is never forget to deactivate the data network mode. </p>
<p> Is there an app or a way to come around with this problem whereby the wifi can be set as a default for data usage even though we have forgotten to deactivate the data network mode? </p>
<p> Widget locker is a paid application, right? is there any way to try out this lock screen widget before buying it? </p>
<p> Thanks! Will be grateful for more tips about this theme! Yours Sincerely: D.Kirov LG Optimus 2x(CM 7.1) </p>

<p> Identify Colors using Android Camera with Smartphone Color Grab App </p>
<p> Identifying the most basic colors is possible for most of us, but going a little deeper into it and trying to play around with the shades and color combinations, there needs some programmed tools or extra skills. For those who are using Android phones, there is an easier option by using an Application called Color Grab, which does the job in the most easiest and fastest way. This is the most simplest on-the-go color picker and recognition tool that helps in multiple ways. </p>
<p> The app would be the most advantageous for the graphic designers who would want to go deep into the exact values of the particular color, and the color blinds who find it difficult to identify a color. It comes with the Color name, Hue, RGB and HSV representation. </p>
<p> This app doesn’t need any special tricks or knowledge to use, and the functioning is simple. You need to open the app which would automatically open the camera and focus on various objects, and you can click on any particular region where you want to check for the color or the exact RGB value of it. On an instant, the result would be shown on the same screen, or you can check it later by going to the Archives where not just the color code but also the rough color and the other values are shown. </p>
<p> Here are some of the best features of the Color Grab app: </p>
<p> No click to capture required, as the color diagnosis and recognition is done instantly on the screen itself </p>
<p> Smart color stabilizer when you are selecting a particular area for color picking </p>
<p> Smart Auto-focus, and in fact works like a macro mode while focusing on very close objects </p>
<p> Works with / without Camera flash. It depends on your wish whether to turn the flash on/off </p>
<p> Almost all the phones are supported, and it works with both Rear and Front cameras </p>
<p> Instant saving of the picked color, and keeping it as an archive </p>
<p> There are 16 basic color categories in the index, while a total of 1300 colors to recognize through this app </p>
<p> The app is pretty simple, so you won’t be able to do much more productive things like sharing the color information with others, than just viewing it in the list or delete it from the list. </p>
<p> One of the other advantages of the Color Grab app is that it is totally free of cost, and there are no ads too. You would see the entire screen filled with the camera capturing area and the other options, and no annoying ads. To install the Color Grab application, you need to go to the Google Play Store – Link You can directly send the app to your phone if you have added it to your Google Play Store account, or else you would need to go to the Play Store from your Android phone and download the application by searching “Color Grab”. </p>

<p> The Internet connection and automation service IFTTT has finally come for Android OS. There’s a special thing about the IFTTT service, which gives you the connections between the apps with a simple statement – “if this then that”. </p>
<p> What IFTTT does is – it connects the applications, and these connections are called as Recipes. These recipes are the user-specified triggers which would connect the apps and services which the most frequently used ones on the web. To explain with an example, here it is: Whenever you are posting an Instagram picture, or are saving one in your favorites, you can just ask IFTTT to save them to the Google Drive. </p>
<p> The task you created above is what the app calls as a Recipe. It would be a little confusing for the first time users, but once you get into the app and try to make a recipe, it would become very easy to set the stuff, and you can even share these recipes for others to take advantage of, and set the same for their phone. </p>
<p> There are channels in which you can get the tasks and automate them. The Android-specific channels include SMS, device, location, notification, phone call and photo. Some other excellent channels which come by default and which you can use, include Philips Hue, Belkin WeMo, Up by Jawbone, Facebook, Google Drive, ESPN, AllShare, Foursquare, Gmail and a lot more. </p>
<p> The recipes / connections between the apps are all available in the collections and you can easily find the best ones in the Featured list. Overall, the IFTTT app does exactly what you wanted to do on a smartphone, the Automation at its best. This app was available for the iOS users since quite some time, after it was exclusively available for the web, but now this being available for Android, the features obviously are more than what the iOS version had, because the backup and syncing is possible in a better way here. </p>
<p> We would soon be sharing a list of best recipes which users can add to their list and automate the device in a better way. The app is available for free on the Android Play Store – Link. </p>

<p> Improve Phone Speed by Removing Apps which Run on Startup </p>
<p> Just like any other PC or laptop your phone is loaded with OS and it works like normal PC. Startup Cleaner is a third-party application for Android phones. As the name itself indicate that this application is for removing unwanted applications during phone startup. This application can improve the phone startup speed (booting speed) and that is the main purpose why we would remove apps at the startup. </p>
<p> This application will run at the start of your phone and it will kill itself when the cleaning is done, so no hassle to again close this app. </p>
<p> Follow the detailed procedure mentioned below to go through the settings – </p>
<p> From the Android Market you need to install the application called as Startup Cleaner 2.0 by Bright Wallace. </p>
<p> Now you need to launch the application. As soon as you launch the application it will guide you through the FAQs of it. Strange but true, this apps does that, click on OK to continue. </p>
<p> This application works straight forward, you will be present directly on to menu where you can see all the apps which runs at start-up of your phone. You can tap to select the app and then hit ‘Batch prevent selected’ to remove them from startup. </p>
<p> The ‘User app’ option located on the top right side will give out option select the user app, system app and installed apps. </p>
<p> Now when you are done, exit from the app and reboot your phone to see the difference. Once your phone is ON, previously I have to wait for atleast two minutes for my phone to become responsive but now this app by disabling various apps at the start-up has made the booting time to less than a minute. Really impressed with this app and it receives 4 /5 rating at Android Market and we are happy to give out same rating to it. </p>

<p> Increase Android Phones battery with Power Control Widget </p>
<p> All of us love saving battery of our phone and if all this can be done with just one widget and one application on your Android device then why not? Actually there are many ways to save the battery for longer use but most of us don’t like tips which are either not practical or very difficult to adapt those tips. So, just 2 tips and you are don with the efficient power saving techniques for your Android device. </p>
<p> First part will be activating the widget and download the app while the second part will be an explanation on how to use both of them to increase your Android battery life. </p>
<p> So, firstly you need to long tap on any one of your Android home screens. For simplicity, you can prefer tapping on the ‘main’ screen itself. Note that since the widget will require an entire ‘row’, its recommended to Select Android widgets from the pop-up menu. </p>
<p> Now, Scroll down to Power Control and select the same as shown in the below snapshot. </p>
<p> Now, a long rectangular widget with 5 ‘buttons’ will appear on your Android home screen as shown in the below snapshot. </p>
<p> If you have a QR Code Reader on your Android phone, then it’s time to use the QR code reader below to launch the Android market Place and scan the below QR Code. Or else alternatively, you can also open the Market app on your Android phone and search for the phrase any cut. As soon as you hit on search you will find the any cut application right on the screen. </p>
<p> Now, you will have to make sure that you select Any Cut 2 by taMMiz and not any other application from the Android Market Place. </p>
<p> Now, Once again return to your Android home screen and long tap till you see the option Add to Home screen option on the display. Now, you need to select Shortcuts option. </p>
<p> Now tap on Any Cut shortcut as shown in the below snapshot. </p>
<p> Now tap on Activity and then scroll down and then select Battery manager out of the long list of application as shown below. </p>
<p> Now, you will be prompted to name your shortcut. The default is the name of the ‘activity’ – in this case its mentioned as Battery as shown below after modification of the same and then after renaming, tap on Ok. </p>
<p> Now you should see a new Shortcut on your home screen. Again, ignore it for now – just make sure it’s there. Also, it is very useful in keeping both the shortcuts Power Control and Battery together. </p>
<p> Now, here we start the procedure, after downloading and installing the apps on your Android device, its time to use the same.The power control widget which is comprising of 5 buttons that can toggle services on and off. From left to right, those services are Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Data and Display Brightness. Each of these 5 services are responsible for huge battery drain. What Power control widget lets you do is to turn off these services when you don’t need any of them. Until you are not using Wi Fi service, its recommended to turn off the Wi Fi or else the continuous drain of battery takes place. Likewise, if you don’t want GPS then you can simply turn off the same from the Power control widget. If there is a green line at the bottom of the widget icon then it means that the service is currently ON and if the light is not there then that means that the service os off. It is always better to turn off things which you don’t want to use from the Power Control widget. </p>
<p> Now tap your newly created Battery home screen shortcut and then you will be directly taken to the Android Battery manager. The battery manager takes out or brings into the light many of the buried Android settings with which you can further optimize your battery life be elongating the same. Just tap on the battery icon to get started. </p>
<p> Now a list of exactly what has been using your battery the most. Now as shown in the below snapshot, you can see that a list of services and the battery consumption is listed below. </p>
<p> Now that you know that it’s the display that has been using the most battery power, you can use the Power Control widget to adjust the brightness of the display to automatic. The brighter your screen, the more battery will be draining faster. Turning the brightness display “off” doesn’t really turn the display off – it sets your Android screen to the very lowest possible brightness setting. The brightness display button in the Power Control widget also has several pre-sets. Tap the button to cycle through them. </p>
<p> If you’re a Social networking addict and update constantly, you’ll probably find that your Twitter or facebook app is one of the bigger battery-drainers. It is always better to set the refresh the list after say 10-15 minutes or instead you can set the refresh rate manually so that frequent refresh doesn’t take place and hence which will save the battery. </p>
<p> Learning which applications and services which use battery the most – and having an easy way to quickly enable/disable them is the best way to extend the battery life of your Android device. If you notice that one of your home screen widgets is using a lot of your battery power like live weather or some live updates then you can turn off the same to save further battery life of the Android device. </p>

<p> Can someone tell me what the five icons on the Power Control widget do? Two of them have symbols that I recognize, but the other three are a mystery. The owner’s manual of course does not say what they are. </p>
<p> it worked somewhat for me, I have a Samsung Galaxy S Fascinate 3G+ on Telus mobility in Canada and the only thing different is the labling for the Battery Manager, on my phone it’s called Battery Use… also Any Cut 2 wasn’t available on my android store, just normal Any Cut (by some guy named Jeff), but it worked exactly the same way, only issue though is that the circular arrow icon in power control doesn’t turn off data, just the automatic sync option of the Accounts and Sync area of the Settings program. </p>
<p> however if you do want to turn off data, (on my phone atleast) hold the power button and a menu should pop up, with Data Network Mode listed on it… that turns data on and off (good for those with small data plans (1GB or less)… </p>
<p> This is something I have not tried yet to save the battery and increase the battery life. Do these power control apps work with all the Android phones? </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Quick Tips to Increase your Android’s Phone Battery Life </p>
<p> Smart phones in general have a lot of functionality. The Android operating system (when loaded with other apps) has a ridiculous amount of functionality. In fact, for the amount of functionality that is packed into an Android device, we get amazing battery life. However, that said we can always look at ways of improving this battery life. Sometimes we are stuck in the middle of nowhere with no means to charge our phones. Maybe we are camping for a week or so and don’t have a means to charge our batteries. In this regard there are a few simple things we can do to conserve the life of our batteries. </p>
<p> 1. Halt all Incoming Signals </p>
<p> Chances are – if you are in the middle of nowhere then you aren’t getting a signal anyway. In this regard, you may even opt to turn your phone off. If you want to use your phone while travelling however, then you can just put the phone into airplane mode. This will stop all incoming and outgoing signals and will reduce the amount of power that your Android is expending. </p>
<p> 2. Turn off GPS </p>
<p> GPS is great, don’t get me wrong. However if you don’t need it, then why have it on? Turn off the GPS in your phone and shut down wireless transmission of unnecessary data. This will save a ton of battery power. It takes a lot of power to constantly communicate with a GPS satellite. Think of how far away the satellite is! </p>
<p> 3. Tweak the Display (1) </p>
<p> There are a few things you can do with your display. Consider turning down the brightness. This will cause the phone to utilise less energy to pump brightness into the display. Also decrease the screen time out. This means that it will turn the back light off behind the screen a lot quicker and won’t burn as much energy. Some phones actually have a power saving mode and both of these things (as well as others) will be altered if the phone is in power saving mode. Have a look around for this option. </p>
<p> 4. Useless Notifications </p>
<p> Although vibrate is not exactly useless – it detrimental to the life of your battery. Consider turning off vibration in order to get a bit of extra life out of your battery. Also, turn the volume down on your sound. The more energy expelled when your phone makes sound the louder the sound is. Consider putting your phone into silent mode if you are using it to play games. You will get an on screen notification of any calls anyway. </p>
<p> 5. Tweak the Display (2) </p>
<p> This is actually an old laptop trick. The less eye candy on screen the longer the battery life because the computer has to work less to make the screen look pretty. This is equally viable in terms of phone battery longevity. Consider turning off any animated icons and overly flashy graphics in the interface. This can save a massive amount of battery power. This is also a nice way to make your phone work a little quicker as you are not reliant on sliding menus and stuff of that nature to get tasks done. </p>

<p> Hi Amit, I am not able to upgrade my Samsung GT-I9003 to latest firmware. Currently it is 2.2.1. I get error message – No response from server. please check if your internet connection is activated and try again. </p>
<p> Can you please advise what to do ? Also is it necessary to upgrade to latest version 2.3 or current version is sufficient ? With this version, I am not able to connect to my office exchange server for mails through native client. But if I install Touchdown client, it works well. What I understand is that with 2.3 version, I can use my native client to connect to exchange server for mails. </p>
<p> Lekin Sir maine to sabhi, features band kar rakhe hai fir bhi battery nahi chalti mere paas samsung galaxy y cdma hai, jo maine sirf 4 days pahle hi kharida hai </p>
<p> “decrease the screen time out”, or just short press the power button to turn the screen off! Never ceases to amaze me how many people walk around with their phones lit up like Christmas trees & then complain about poor battery life! It’s a Smartphone: be Smart & press the button!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p>

<p> How to Increase Galaxy S5 Speaker Sound with Volume Boost Mod </p>
<p> The latest flagship from Samsung, the Samsung Galaxy S5 as a device has failed to impress every geek around, for a few reasons known to them, and the competitor devices Sony Xperia Z2 and HTC One M8 received the appreciation for the few features better than in the S5. The volume output of the phone’s speakers is one of the things many of its owners might not feel pleased with. For those who own the Galaxy S5, you might surely be feeling that the volume levels are too lower than expected. </p>
<p> But the sound levels can be increased, thanks to a mod that is available to tweak the internal system and raise the volume levels. A developer, stalli0nUK from the XDA community has build a mod to boost the volume levels of the Samsung Galaxy S5. The mods come packed in recovery flashable zip, so there is no need to put the mod manually. There are three versions of volume boost for Galaxy S5: </p>
<p> Version 1: Lite – All sounds in the device are boosted by 4, where the boost is quite good and there would be no noticeable distortion of sound. </p>
<p> Version 2: Medium – This is a moderate level of sound boost, where the sound levels are boosted by 5. This too doesn’t show any sound distortion, as it is just a slight increase. </p>
<p> Version 3: Extra Loud – The sound gets boosted by 6. Here, some sound distortion can be noticed when the sound levels are increased to maximum. </p>
<p> Version 4: Lite + Headphone Increase – Same as the Lite version, apart from the fact that headphone volume is increased slightly. </p>
<p> Compatibility: The mod has been tested successfully on the international Galaxy S5 LTE SM-G900F, T-Mobile, T-Mobile S5 SM-G900T, Canadian Galaxy S5 G900W8, etc. It should work on all Qualcomm models of the Galaxy S5. </p>
<p> Prerequisites: Following are the things you need ready before you can install this MOD on the Samsung Galaxy S5. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S5 rooted with custom recovery like CWM/TWRP installed </p>
<p> Recovery Flashable Volume boost MOD – Download from the links below </p>
<p> Download Galaxy S5 Volume Boost Mod </p>
<p> Warning: Do not try the loud version of the mod to avoid audio distortion. Go with either version 1, 2 or 4. </p>
<p> How to Install Volume Boost Mod </p>
<p> How to install: </p>
<p> First, take a backup of the current ROM before proceeding with the below steps </p>
<p> Download the mod file from the links above, and then copy the zip to phone </p>
<p> Reboot the Galaxy S5 into CWM/TWRP recovery mode. You can do that by turning the phone off, then press and hold the Volume Up+Home+Power buttons together for 4-5 seconds </p>
<p> In the recovery mode, Use the Install option, navigate to the volume mod Zip file and select it </p>
<p> Confirm the installation and wait till it is installed </p>
<p> Finally, reboot the phone using the Reboot system option </p>
<p> Thank the developer who was able to make this MOD which helps in getting things done, and increasing the volume levels without having to do much. </p>

<p> Hye , Do i need to root my device ? And would it avoird my warranty or affect anything on my device . </p>
<p> Having just purchased my second Samsung phone S3 and now S5 I an so disappointed at the sound. It has been recommended as a blue tick phone and I have trouble hearing the phone ring or the caller. </p>
<p> I used this mod and it worked perfectly. My galaxy st so much louder now. I used the volume mod medium. All thanks to Chetan Bhawani who made the work of the XDA Developer guy, come to my knowledge. Thanks both and have a great day. More grease to those elbows. Cheers. </p>
<p> why does everything needs to be rooted. Samsung should do an update. in the sound department HTC leads the field. I have had the S5 since release . the sound volume and playback has to be one of the worst out there. Come on Sammy lift your game. make an update available for loyalist that don’t root their phones. </p>

<p> How to Increase Sony Ericsson Xperia Active Battery Life </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson is one of the companies to introduce Android phones in the Market while Android OS was into development stages with versions 1.6 – 2.0, well the 2010 generation of Xperia Android smart phones covered all the segments like low – end, mid – end and high – end. Sony Ericsson Xperia Android smart phones from 2011 generation are enriched with Android OS 2.3 Gingerbread with features which will stun the users. One such phone is Xperia Active, an active phone for active users. </p>
<p> Xperia Active is one such phone which offers you plenty of things which will allow you to use the touch screen even when your finger is wet, yes the phone supports wet finger tracking. Well what more does it has to offer? If you are so curious then I just have one word and that is ‘Excellency’. Active is incorporated with water resistant, dust proof, scratch resistant multi touch screen, ANT+, Bravia engine, 5 MP camera supporting HD video capabilities with video light, 1 GHz Snapdragon processor and more. All of these will definitely become a reason to drain your battery and reduce the battery life if not operated with care and tactics. The battery present on this phone is standard Lithium ion 1200 mAh battery which will help you to work with most of the essential features. The phone is very well designed and will attract most of the health enthusiasts, hikers and trekkers. If you want to make optimal usage of the phone then you may just manage to keep the battery alive for a day, but in order to use phone with optimal conditions make sure that a particular function is used only when it is necessary and is turned OFF accordingly. </p>
<p> The features that will use up most of the battery are accelerometer, Wi – Fi b/g/n, Wi – Fi Hotspot, aGPS, Camera flash light, Bluetooth 2.1, LED back lit LCD Display brightness, SYNC function, Facebook inside Xperia and Android 2.3 Gingerbread OS. The following steps will help you in using each feature appropriately. </p>
<p> Accelerometer is normally used to turn the screen orientation as we change the phone orientation, well this feature can be turned OFF in Settings/Display/Auto rotate option. This option can be used only during trekking so that we get a wide view on the map. </p>
<p> Wi – Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 2.1 are normally the most responsible factors for draining the battery as it is normally left turned ON after its usage. Wi – Fi is not always available in all places, so it will be a wise decision to turn it OFF in that case. Using Wi – Fi Hot spot requires a lot of power and so it is advised that the facility must be used in the worst conditions when you have no any other options left. </p>
<p> GPS feature must be turned OFF most of the times and must be brought into use only when required like when you are out for a trek, but make sure the feature is turned ON only when you need accurate location. If you are in a city and you are receiving a network provider signal on the phone then you can rather use the inaccurate network provided location which is normally accurate up to 1000 meters. </p>
<p> Camera flash light can be used only when in darker places and its usage must be avoided in adequate lighting conditions. But if you are on an occasion then make sure you follow other steps. </p>
<p> LED backlit LCD brightness must be set to minimum to medium settings. Usually the brightness is automatically adjusted according to the outside light incident on the screen. This can be accomplished by using Power widget. The display time out must be set as low as possible; you can choose the same from 10 seconds to 15 seconds. </p>
<p> Auto SYNC function can be turned OFF when you are not on a data network or when you are connected to the internet using a computer. </p>
<p> Android OS itself require lot of resources but then we can manage certain features such that we are able to use it and enjoy it even more. Android applications that run in the background can be controlled by using certain applications like Advanced task killer which will help you manage running applications on your Xperia Active. Certain features like Haptic feedback, vibrating alert and Live wallpapers must be turned OFF or must not be used extensively. This guide will definitely help you conserve most of the battery life for more important events. </p>

<p> How to Insert SIM Card & MicroSD Card in the Moto E (Quick Tip) </p>
<p> With the new smartphones entering the market, a big issue for a new phone owner would be about the placement of SIM card and MicroSD card if there’s a slot for it. Why? because each phone comes with its own requirement which cannot be altered. Some smartphones would require a normal SIM, some need the MicroSD while some like the iPhone 5s & Moto X need a Nano SIM. </p>
<p> The Motorola Moto E comes with the Dual-SIM connectivity and both the SIM cards supported are the Micro SIM cards. The MicroSD card support is there in the Moto E, with the storage expansion possible with a 32GB MicroSD card at max. </p>
<p> Now, let’s check how to insert the MicroSD card into the Moto E. First off, you will have to remove the back cover because the slots are located beside the non-removable battery and are exposed only when the battery door is removed. The photo below would show you which is the location for the MicroSD and which is for the Micro SIM. </p>
<p> Remove the battery door of Moto E: The battery door can be removed by placing the fingernail in the bottom MicroUSB slot, and then press a finger against the Motorola logo on the center. Pull out the battery door from the bottom with some force, and it would pop out. </p>
<p> Once open, you will notice the three slots – one for MicroSD card, and two for the Micro SIM cards. The one in lowest part is the MicroSD card slot, and there is a label written over it for you to check and understand. Below is the picture showing the shape and direction in which the cards have to be inserted in the Moto E. </p>
<p> While the back of the phone faces you, you need to insert the MicroSD card in a direction where the larger flat surface is on the outer side, and the chip of the card faces the other side, just as given in the picture below. There won’t be any push noise, but a little push is needed to properly place the card in the slot. </p>
<p> Inserting the SIM Card in Moto E </p>
<p> This isn’t any different either because you need to insert the SIM where the diagonal cut on the SIM has to be on the left bottom side when the SIM chip is facing the other side. Check the picture below for a better idea. </p>
<p> The final picture: </p>
<p> Do let us know if you have any queries around the Moto E, and we should be happily solving them. </p>

<p> How to Install Android 4.4 KitKat OS Custom ROM on your Google Nexus 4 </p>
<p> The Android 4.4 KitKat update for the Nexus devices such as the Nexus 4 and Nexus 7 is going to be sent soon, i.e. in a couple of weeks as said by the makers, but if you are looking to have that running already in your Nexus 4, there is a ROM that is alraedy available, and although that isn’t an official ROM from Google, you can try it out to get an experience of what actually the Android 4.4 would be like, when Google sends the update officially to your device. </p>
<p> Although you might enjoy doing this and trying out the new ROM on your device, do remember that this would void the warranty provided by the company, and you would need to backup all the data before trying out the installation of the 4.4 KitKat ROM on the Nexus 4. </p>
<p> For this one to install, the device should have the TWRP custom recovery or the Clockworld Mod installed because it won’t be installing on the stock TWRP custom recovery. Now, to install you need to follow the steps given below. </p>
<p> Download the ROM file from the following link: Click here Now, transfer the downloaded ROM file to your Nexus 4 internal storage, by connecting the smartphone to the computer and then transferring the file to the root folder of the Nexus 4 device. Make sure it is in the root and not somewhere within any folder </p>
<p> Pre-installation Instructions </p>
<p> Power down the Nexus 4 smartphone </p>
<p> Boot up the phone in recovery mode, by holding the volume and the power buttons at the same time </p>
<p> In the recovery mode, you will have to use the power buttons to move up and down, and to execute anything you need to press the power button </p>
<p> Move down until you see the option of Recovery mode, and there press the power button so that you are booted into the recovery mode </p>
<p> In the recovery mode itself you would see the option of “Backup & Restore” which you have to do first because you might be wiping and losing all the data during the ROM installation, so backing it up is necessary </p>
<p> Once the backup is done, you need to go to Wipe Data / Factory Reset option and follow the different instructions or prompts until the reset is done </p>
<p> Now go to wipe cache partition and follow the different instructions </p>
<p> Go to the Advanced section and select “wipe Dalvik Cache” and follow the different instructions </p>
<p> Installation Instructions </p>
<p> Once all the above steps are done, your Nexus 4 is ready for the installation of the Android 4.4 KitKat ROM. Go to Install Zip > Install Zip from sd card > 0/ and then select the ROM file which you transferred (4.4_mako_odexed.zip is the name of the file you transferred) </p>
<p> Reboot the smartphone after the installation is completed and the first time when the Nexus 4 is rebooting, it would take some time. </p>
<p> If at all you got any issues while installing, you can comment below and we would try to guide you through, but make sure you read the comments at the official XDA thread too: Link </p>

<p> How to install Android 7.1 Nougat based LineageOS 14.1 on Intex Aqua 4G+ </p>
<p> Intex which is a well-known brand for launching affordable smartphones had launched a new smartphone called the Intex Aqua 4G+. This is yet again an affordable offering from the company, and it was quite popular as well. It was powered by a Mediatek MT6735 which is a Quad-core processor with 1.3 GHz, and it has 2 GB RAM as well. It also has an internal storage of 16 GB which is also expandable upto 32GB via a microSD card. In terms of the camera, we are looking at a 13MP sensor at the back and 5MP sensor at the front. </p>
<p> However, since it is a particularly old device, it is not yet updated to the Nougat, and it looks like it won’t for a long time since there is no official info on the same. So if you wish to run the latest version of Android on this smartphone then, your only option is to flash it manually with the help of a third-party ROM like LineageOS. If you are wondering how to do it, then you are the right place, since we will be showing you exactly how to install Android 7.1 Nougat based LineageOS 14.1 on Intex Aqua 4G+. But first, let’s learn something about the ROM itself before installation. </p>
<p> About the ROM </p>
<p> LineageOS is nothing but the same old CyanogenMod with a different name since the company is now acquired by CyanogenMod. It has all the exact same features as to what CyanogenMod previously had, and it is in fact just as reliable as the CyanogenMod was. There are a couple of bugs, but they won’t hinder your day-to-day user experience whatsoever. As we all know that Cyanogengen is known for performance and utility based tasks and this won’t disappoint you either. </p>
<p> Prerequisite </p>
<p> The first thing you need to make sure is that you create a complete backup of your smartphone. Since we will be using custom recovery method, your internal memory will be wiped clean, and you will loose all your data. </p>
<p> Another thing to make sure is that your device should be rooted in order for this installation to work. </p>
<p> Also, before starting the installation, you also need to make sure that you have about 50-60 percent of battery. If your smartphone’s battery dies in the middle during the installation, then you will end up with a completely bricked smartphone. </p>
<p> Be sure to download all the necessary files from the links given below. </p>
<p> Installation </p>
<p> Assuming that you have downloaded the files given in the links above, it is now time to begin the installation. </p>
<p> Now the first step is to turn off the device and enter the recovery mode. You can do this pressing Volume Down + Power Key at the same time. </p>
<p> Once you are in the recovery mode, go to wipe, and format option ⇒ wipe data, system, cache and Dalvik cache to proceed further. </p>
<p> With that you will be wiping your internal storage. </p>
<p> After that, go back to the recovery menu and click on Install. </p>
<p> Now navigate to the .zip file where you copied it earlier in the first step. </p>
<p> Once done, swipe to Install and this will begin the installation procedure. </p>
<p> After the installation, it is now time to install the GApps as well, and the procedure for that is also the same. </p>
<p> Once done, reboot and you will be running the latest Android 7.0 Nougat based LineageOS 14.1. </p>
<p> Do make a note that the first reboot may take more time than usual since it has initiate everything so we suggest you be patient with the same. With that said, if you have any queries with the installation, then be sure to let us know by leaving a comment down below and also stay tuned to Android Advices for tutorials like this. </p>

<p> How to Install Android 4.4 KitKat Custom ROM on Moto X [T-Mobile] </p>
<p> Motorola did announce it earlier than others that they would be coming up with the Android 4.4 KitKat update very soon but there is no exact date given for the same. One of the developers on the XDA developers forum has leaked the KitKat ROM for the Moto X which are on the T-mobile network. </p>
<p> This seems to be a dump from the developer edition the Moto X, and it still seems stable enough, and the little issues are quite expected. But before you try installing this one, make sure the phone has the bootloader unlocked. The ROM is said to make the phone lose the root access, but that won’t be an issue when the user is able to install a very new refreshing ROM on the Moto X. </p>
<p> The updates that are included in this are the Touchless Control, Active Display, Camera and the home screen selector. And as this is the KitKat ROM, there are most of the 4.4 features including the SMS with Hangouts, the new and improved keyboard and interface. The Google Experience launcher and the Google Now are not included, but the Android 4.4 install guide has the links to all the apk files and you can install them to get all the needed experience. </p>
<p> How to Install Android 4.4 ROM on Moto X [T-Mobile] </p>
<p> Firstly, download the needed files by going to the following link: Download Link </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to install the Android 4.4 ROM on your Moto X. </p>
<p> Put the Moto X in the fastboot mode. For that you will need to press and hold the power + volume down button when the power is off </p>
<p> Connect the phone to the PC </p>
<p> Now while the phone is connected, extract the downloaded file on the PC and run the flashall.bat file and then the process would happen on the computer </p>
<p> Do keep in mind again that everything including the bootloader and recovery would be updated and thus the root access would be gone. </p>
<p> The recent rumors with the T-Mobile Moto X are that Motorola is going to include the T-Mobile USA into the Moto Maker website and the users from then would be able to customize the panel design of the device. For now, it’s just the AT&T or the SIM-Free option of Motorola Moto X available in White and Black colors. </p>

<p> How to Install Apps on SD Card without Android Rooting </p>
<p> At AndroidAdvices, it’s our continuous endeavor to assist with all your Android needs and we are always happy to hear from you. So whenever you wanted anything about anything about your Android then we are here to help you out. So, in lines with this though in this article we will check out on how you can forcefully install the Android applications on your SD Card without needing you to root the phone as we understand that rooting voids the warranty and includes hassles sometimes. Only one thing which we would like to request you is to just follow each and every single instruction which we mentioned so as to forcefully install the apps on your SD CARD as some phones are not capable of storing apps on SD Card. </p>
<p> Before you proceed, you need to move all the applications from your SD Card to the phone memory. Once you do this, you can proceed to follow the procedure which is mentioned below. </p>
<p> Procedure to Install apps in SD Card Forcefully: </p>
<p> Download Java Development Kit (JDK) followed by which you need to download the Software Development Kit (SDK) in your computer along with that you need to download the USB Drivers and also you need to ensure that the PC Suite is installed in your computer. </p>
<p> Now, enable the USB Debugging Mode from the path “Settings > Applications > Development > USB debugging”. You can also refer to the below mentioned image to enable the same. </p>
<p> After installing the Java SDK, you need to install the Android SDK in your computer. After installing the Android SDK, you now need to run the tool called the Android SDK Platform tools. </p>
<p> Now, you will have to head to the toolkit which contains the Android Debug Bridge, a utility that allows you to communicate with an Android device from the command line. </p>
<p> After this, you need to connect the Android phone to the computer using the USB Cable. </p>
<p> Open the command prompt in your computer which you can open by pressing the “Windows + R” and then you need to type in the command as “cmd” and then enter the path as Android\Android-SDK\Platform-tools. </p>
<p> Now, you need to type in the command as “adb devices” to check whether the phone is connected or not. Now, if it appears as “offline”, you need to check with the USB cable. Enter the command as “netstat” to check with the port is in use or not. If it is in use then then you need to close the process which is in the use. </p>
<p> You will now need to proceed and check whether all the firewall and antivirus tools are disabled as these tools generally tend to interrupt the process. </p>
<p> Now, all you need to do is to enter the command as “setInstallLocation” wherein after which it will accept the three valueswhich means; </p>
<p> 0 [auto]: Let the phone decide the best location for an app </p>
<p> 1 [internal]: It installs everything in the internal storage </p>
<p> 2 [external]: It installs everything in the memory card </p>
<p> You need to now change the value from 0 to 2 setInstallLocation. For changing this, you need to run the following command, </p>
<p> adb shell pm setInstallLocation 2 </p>
<p> Just in case if there is no error message, unplug the phone and restart the phone. After this, you will be in a position to easily install the applications in the SD Card. Do let us know just in case if you face any issues as we will try our level best to ensure that the issues are addressed at the earliest. </p>

<p> after installing a game after the procedure given above won’t there be a decrease in the memory of external memory card </p>
<p> hi ive done the whole process checked my phone and it tells me im using option 2 external but it still saves to internal phone is a galaxy megaGT-19005 any adeas whats wrong </p>
<p> Thank you very much Pradeep, this is great!!! I was able to move many more apps than before (but not all) to SD-card after a few additions, which were: The connection of the phone to the computer when plugging in the cable should be as disk drive. in cmd.exe under SDK platform first cd (change directory) to get to C:\ . Then cd (change directory), so: C:\Users\your username\cd, than you get C:\ than enter path exactly like in Windows Explorer (use round ( and ), not square [ and ]!), C:\cd Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk\platform-tools C:\ Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk\platform-tools>adb devices run setInstallLocation not separately, but as C:\ Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk\platform-tools> adb shell pm setInstallLocation 2 </p>
<p> But now my questions: 1. Does this procedure also work with BlueStacks as an emulator instead of SDK? (BlueStacks was already on my PC for WhatsApp on PC purposes. It is much easier to use and much smaller than SDK. I now removed BueStacks to get rid of the error “more than one device and emulator ” in cmd.exe.) 2. Do I have to disable USB debugging in my phone afterwards? </p>
<p> I would like to know because I have to do it all over again since my HTC Wildfire S was broken and replaced by a new one. If I cannot use BlueStacks and have to remove it, do you know a way to keep my messages and contacts in WhatsApp which runs under BlueStacks on my PC? Thanks in advance. </p>
<p> Hi Pradeep Neela, My phone is Galaxy Ace Plus. After running the command “adb shell pm setInstallLocation 2” in the command prompt, my phone still follows “0 [auto]: Let the phone decide the best location for an app” while installing apps. What could be the reason. </p>
<p> i want to ask dat can i do this without rooting uo the device na.. n where can i gt usb driver?? website,, i have already installed adk and jdk.. bt my phne s nt detected at all </p>

<p> ya it worked now when i install apps like facebook flash player it direcly moves to sd card great work thanks </p>
<p> The Tutorial Worked. After doing the process stated here i used appstosd App to move the apps to my SD card. I was able to move Facebook Twitter etc apps to SD card however, Apps like Drop Box, Gmail, Maps & Play Store did not show the highlighted ” Move to SD Card” Button ?? </p>
<p> Actualy i think U’re pretty lucky, a’m wondering how is possible to move facebook to sd card ? I alredy install app2sd but i dont have option for facebook to move from phone (actualy i dont see facebook at all) Any advise? </p>
<p> Hi apps like gmail, maps are marked as System apps hence it cannot be moved. If you really want to move it then you need to root your phone and convert those apps to user app by using link2sd or app2sd </p>
<p> Is there an error in the command line?? It says “Now, all you need to do is to enter the command as “setInstallLocation” .. but if I do it it says the command is not allowed. Do I have to type in “adb shell pm setInstallLocation” to get the message shown in the command image above? Will it work on a wildfire s? </p>
<p> which java development kit that i have to download? and does it work with the samsung galaxy fit? </p>
<p> I did it, it worked, but when I tried to install an App, the phone automatically reboots without installing it, just as it does when I try to move something to the SD Card. I tried changing it for a new SD card, and nothing changed. Help, please! </p>
<p> hey, how did u do this step ?? Now, you will have to head to the toolkit which contains the Android Debug Bridge, a utility that allows you to communicate with an Android device from the command line. </p>
<p> help me plz… i’ve a HTC Explorer.. and i want to use this system… </p>
<p> 1. open the folder android->android-sdk->SDK manager(Run as administrator) 2.Check the android-sdk platform tools and install the packages 3.Now give the command in cmd 4.Select the usb debugging in your phone by selecting HTC Sync as the mode 5.Now write the command in cmd “adb devices” (w/o parenthesis) 6.It will show “List of Devices attached” .if not present then connect your phone again 7.then follow the same steps as above …..write adb shell pm 8.check for the 0,1,2 values once 9.then adb shell pm setInstallLocation 2 </p>
<p> I’m trying this on an htc wildfire s when i try and use the “adb devices” command it does not see the phone. the phone is in debug usb and in charge only mode. Any ideas? </p>
<p> not work, it does indicated apk will install to external storage. but when I try install a apk, it prompt me no enough space for the app. It has 1GB free space, the app only need 5MB. Why this happen? How to fix it? </p>
<p> Lucky I have a degree in computer science, why should it be easy to choose primary storage location. </p>
<p> After I type the command as AndroidAndroid-SDKPlatform-tools. it shows the system cannot find the path specified, so what should I do now? </p>
<p> my command prompt always show c:> how to have only c: , i think thats why my commands could not locate the platfor-tools folder </p>
<p> It always shows specified file /path not found, tried atleast 5-6 times. can someone do it for me over team weaver or skype, I will pay 🙂 </p>
<p> it should work, we haven’t tried it. You can try the same! there won’t be any issue </p>

<p> Hi, Yesterday i bought HTC Explorer Android 2.3 Mobile. I’m a beginner of the Android services. Please suggest me any tutorial, how to operate my cell such as how to install the new apps from sd to cell, how to install the live wallpapers from pc to sd to cell…..etc. Please make reply…. </p>
<p> Pradeep Neela… Is it mandatory to move all the apps to SD card before following the instructions. If yes do I’ve to move the apps including the one which are there by default. Frankly speaking… I am fearing of what will happen to my mobile, if my memory card gets corrupted. </p>
<p> hi neel, i have restarted 2-3 times my galaxy ace but i cannot find my device in the list plz he me out </p>
<p> Hi will this work on my HTc HD2 which i changed from windows to andriod(nexus one 2.3.4) </p>
<p> I did as you told but apps won’t install on sd card nor would any app move to sd. using galaxy fit GT-S5670. android gingerbread 2.3.4. mail me too please. </p>
<p> Does this move apps to the 2nd internal position on say the galaxy s2 or optimus 3d or the actual external sd card? Some phones easily allow transfer to external sd eg Sony ericcson x10. Others just transfer to internal 2nd partition. To repeat will this work on galaxy s2 and move things to the actual external sd card? please answer since a few wish to know. </p>
<p> hi when install android sdk after executing it there is showing only android sdk tool and not showing android sdk platform tool.what should i do? </p>
<p> when I connected my HTC mobile it asked me for ADB file and it cannot be found, therefore software was not insatlled. I gave up </p>
<p> Hi I have a Galaxy W and how can i directly install APPS in my EXTERNAL SD.. this process that your teaching is this the solution? </p>
<p> Just bought an Archos 80 G9 for my wife very surprised and dissapointed that Honeycomb seems unable to write to SD Card apparently only having ‘read’ ability. Am I right thinking that the above would therefore not work with Honeycomb. </p>
<p> If not is there a way of installing applications to the SD card using a PC that would be seen and run by the Honeycomb Tablet once the SD card is returned to the tablet. </p>
<p> I already have installed on my PC the full SDK with tools and simulator but to be honest up until now have had little use for it other than just playing about. </p>
<p> After entering the path “then enter the path as Android\Android-SDK\Platform-tools.”, it shows “The system cannot find the path specified”. Please advise. </p>
<p> Recently i have purchase superpad (android 2.3.4, model SAWEE) with 4GB internal memory. i wish to add 4GB SD card and move all application to SD due to lack of internal memory. But not able to enable SD dubug, this is disabled, and no option to enable debug. I do not have wifi and purchased 3G modem and also not detected. Could you please advice the root to enable SD card and drive to enable USB 3G wireless modem ( it only supports XP) </p>
<p> hi pradeep m not able to find the path on command i typed as u hv instructed but it says path not found plz help </p>
<p> Hey when i trying to install packages it showing failed to create directory what can i do plz tell me i am in a knee desire of free space please reply me </p>
<p> When setting the default installation location to 2 will it install everything to the external storage/micro sd card? I use aps2sd and I noticed that apps2sd just transfers the apps to the internal memory 2nd partition.(using samsung) I thought it will move the apps to my external storage/micro sd card. I hope this will solve my problem without me rooting my phone. Anyone have tried this guide? </p>
<p> Hi Da, Sorry I do not know your name, I have same problem with my Samsung W I1850. It has 3 layer memory and I am trying to direct apps download to external SD. Tried above procedure of no avail. Did you find any solution to this problem, Sincerely Gregory </p>
<p> Directly execute the command “adb shell pm setInstallLocation 2″ . Please see all the comments before asking question. </p>
<p> Does it mean we ALWAYS install apps on SD by default already? </p>
<p> and we can have option still to move to phone after that rite? </p>
<p> but if we move to SD after that does it move to internal or external sd? for devices like galaxy w i8150 with 3 layer memory… </p>
<p> We have the same dilemma. I also own a Galaxy W I8150 and when I move my apps to SD card it will always install it to the internal 2nd partition not in the external SD card(micro SD card). I think what he meant was after we move the app to the internal memory then back to external SD will it still be moved to the 2nd partition of the internal memory? </p>
<p> hi whn i give the command \netstat\ in command prompt,it says\TIME-WAIT\.and also i cant able to execute \SetinstallLocation\ system says cant find the path,Is it possible for u guys to solve this issue??????? </p>
<p> Directly execute this command “adb shell pm setInstallLocation 2″. It will work. Please see all the comments </p>
<p> Can I use it for my Samsung Galaxy Fit S 5670? When I go to JDK and SDk sites I find lot of options for downloading. Please let me know which one to choose. I have windows XP on my computer. The phone has Gingerbread 2.3.4 version. Please guide me further. Is it for common users or this setting is for advanced users? </p>
<p> Neal please answer wich of the gingerbread are new official update in france xxjvt or xfjva???? </p>
<p> My device is detected. But i Couldn’t find this command “setInstallLocation”. When I tried executing the command directly “adb shell pm setInstallLocation 2” . It is accepted. </p>
<p> Now it allows to move some application to SD card. </p>
<p> I would like to ask a question – will this work with Android 2.1 (Eclaire)? If so, while the above procedures will enable me to install apps to my SD card, will I have the option to install apps to my phone’s internal memory or at least move some apps from the SD card to the internal memory. Thanks for the great advises. This is a great information source for things Android. </p>

<p> Install CyanogenMod 10.1 MMS App on Android 4.1 with Quick Reply & Emoji </p>
<p> CyanogenMod, one of the most famous custom ROMs on Android smartphones comes with a great looking and highly functional MMS application. This not only has a beautiful interface, but comes with Emoji support and Quick Reply buttons alongside too. In this post, we’ll take a look on how to get this application on all Android smartphones, irrespective of whether it is running a copy of Cyanogenmod or not. </p>
<p> Note : You need to have a rooted Android device to have this work. If your phone is not rooted yet, root your Android phone to allow applications to gain access to root level permissions before proceeding. </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Download the APK file of the MMS Application by Cyanogenmod. Download Link </p>
<p> Now, connect your phone to the computer and place the downloaded apk file in the root of your smartphone directory, either on the phone or on the SD Card. </p>
<p> Download and Install any Root-enabled file explorer application from the Play Store. The recommended ones are Root Explorer or Root Browser Lite Free. </p>
<p> Now, using the above downloaded application, navigate to the folder where the downloaded file was placed and ensure that it is named as “Mms.apk”. If not, tap and hold it to rename it as mentioned. </p>
<p> Now, copy the file and tap on the ‘Back’ button. </p>
<p> Further , head to the following directory : system -> app . </p>
<p> Now, hit the paste button and allow the file to overwrite the existing file in that directory. </p>

<p> ty so very much sir! at last i can use flash on my phone!! it work on any browser that support flash plugin like boat,opera mobile, xscope, and stock browser on my galaxy mini 2.3.4 stock rom! </p>
<p> How come you have done this…I have tried dis thing but it is still showinng me higher version of flash required when i m trying to play live tv? </p>
<p> Hi, I have successfully followed all steps and followed all mentioned steps. But for copying and permission setting I used root browser instead of root explorer. when i go to flash sites (eg : settings.adobe.com) no flash content is loaded, neither flash required message. I use Opera-mobile browser. Can you please help me to overcome this problem. thanks in advance. </p>
<p> I have a rooted gio gingerbread 2.3.3 , I did what I had to do, but it dont work. Is it possible that this only work on froyo phones? there one file named libstagefright_FROYO.so? I hope you understood my bad english. </p>
<p> flash will drain ur battery super fast and if u on a quota based internet plan which most phone carrier apply for their internet package better get a monthly 3gb and above data plan because it eats up ur broadband data big time. my advise is to install skyfire instead which has a build in video player for flash and it will saved 70% data usage over flash but the catch is the skyfire web browser is free,the video license to activate the video player u have to pay…u can try google around to activate the video player (laughing with a devil smile..u know what i mean)… one advantages i found out with this video player/web browser although u live in a country which block certain web site such as youtube, yes the web page will show page not found bla..bla..bla but when u press video button it will analyze and waalllaaa the video pops up, press play and enjoy..btw nice article </p>
<p> I followed ur guide and successfully installed it in my galaxy gio but I still get the message that I need to instal the latest adobe flash player. </p>
<p> I have used opera, dolphin mini, and the default phone browser with the same result. </p>
<p> After installing flash player it supports flash but with a lot of lagg,, is there any fix for this ??? </p>
<p> Hi, I have rooted galaxy ace. I also have installed terminal emulator and I am familiar with linux commands as well. Cant I do above .so file moving without using root explorer? ( just using ‘mv /data/data/com.adobe.flashplayer’ as root using terminal emulator) Thanks in advance, Jayanath. </p>

<p> How to Install Lock screen Themes without Rooting your Android Phones </p>
<p> While Samsung and Apple continuous to fight it out on the name of “Copying” each other’s technology and interface, we will see in this article on how you can easily make your Android phone look like an Apple iPhone not wholly but at least the Lock screen along with the various styled Wallpapers. The best part is that there is no need to root or go through the painful steps of customizing the phone. Though with the help of the Clock Work Mod recovery you can easily customize the phone but again it requires you to go through the numerous steps to customize the phone and so does the application called Magic locker arrives which provides the choices. </p>
<p> Note : Please note that this may or may not work with the users who are on the Custom ROM firmware and also to use this application it’s not a compulsion to use the device which is rooted. Also, installing this application won’t root the phone in any manner, so be rest assured about the same. </p>
<p> With the help of the Magic Locker application, you can easily choose from the very good looking an colorful lock screen themes out of which some may be paid and some may be the paid ones. There are some free lock screens available which are called as the “HTC Sense” as well as the “Steve Jobs” which looks very great. So, if you choose the Steve Jobs option, the unlock screen will be just as that of the one which is there in the Apple iPhone while the other one which is the HTC one is exactly the same as the one which is found in the HTC native phones. You can also refer the below screen captures of the various lock screens which come with the support of the Magic lock Screen application. </p>
<p> In all there are 12 themes to choose from which you can download from the Android Market place. To get more themes all you need to do is to just choose the option of “More themes” to get more themes. The Magic Locker Main App just includes one theme – ‘Lost Robot’, as the default theme, you can search more themes in Google Market. Lost Robot is the default themes in the Magic Locker. </p>
<p> Do let us know on your thoughts on this application and just in case if you wish to get more information on the customization about your phone then do le us know in the comments section along with your phone’s model number and the current versions so that we can then recommend you the new custom ROM or the better firmware than the current one which is installed in your phone. This application is very small and is less than an MB which can be downloaded from the Android Market Place or also you can download from the QR Code which is mentioned below. </p>

So, irrespective of you are in a couch or in a car, your can search in a touch less fashion as the results are then spoken by Google Now. </p>
<p> How Touch Less Control Works in Google Now? </p>
<p> All thanks to the Open Mic + which ensures that the microphone is running in the background and just needs a particular phrase to wake up. So, in this case the phrase is “Okay Google”. With tasker integration, it truly automate your device by combining the endless command list of Tasker with the ease of access of Open Mic. </p>
<p> The best part is that the Open Mic + uses the Offline Voice recognition which means that it consumes lesser data and can process results faster. Also, adding to the above this Open Mic+ has no ads, no in app purchases feature and also is free to Download. </p>

<p> How to Install Android L Developer Preview on Nexus 5 / Nexus 7 within 10 Minutes (Simplest Guide) </p>
<p> If you have Nexus 5 or say Nexus 7, you can now install the latest Android L which has been just released few minutes back. With Android lovers already loving the new MATERIAL DESIGN interface, it’s time to install this update before anyone does. So before we slip into the detailed instructions which will help you update the device, you need to follow the list of quick pre requisites which are summed up below. </p>
<p> Video Tutorial Below www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCdrUXoZL2o </p>
<p> Note: Please note that this is the test build and may come with some of the bugs. </p>
<p> Quick Pre Requisites </p>
<p> All the data in your Nexus 5/ Nexus 7 can be backed up manually with the help of below steps. Though, it’s not a mandatory step to back up the data manually in this case, but it’s advised to take the backup manually. </p>
<p> SMS – Use “SMS Backup & Restore app”, Contacts – Sync with the Gmail application, Call Log – Call Log and Restore Images, Songs, Videos, Files – Copy to internal / External SD Card, APN and MMS Settings – Note down from the path “Applications > Settings > Wireless and Network > Mobile Networks > Access Point Names” </p>

<p> Disclaimer: Follow all the instructions mentioned in this article as if there is any damage caused due to not following instructions then we shall not be held liable or responsible. Just in case if you face any issues then we will try our level best to address the same. </p>
<p> Let’s proceed to the next step where we have summed up the detailed guide which will help you apply this latest update in your device. </p>
<p> Procedure to Update Nexus 5 or Nexus 7 with Android L Preview Firmware: </p>
<p> First up, you need to download the below mentioned files depending upon the device on which the update needs to be applied. </p>
<p> The ADB file has to be first extracted and installed, and it would take care of everything from installing the ADB drivers and phone drivers. Once that is done, go to the folder where you downloaded the image file for Android L for your Android device, i.e. either Nexus 5 or Nexus 7. It takes no more than a minute to install it and proceed to the next step. </p>
<p> Extract the Image files to a folder which you can access easily. Now, based on the computer you are using, follow the instructions below for Windows and Mac OS. </p>
<p> For Windows Users </p>
<p> Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files of Android L image, and there right click on the empty folder area to see the commands. Click on “Open command window here” and then the command window would open for that particular folder. </p>
<p> Then, you will have to enter a few commands, in the following manner for the Android L image to be installed on your Nexus device. </p>
<p> adb devices </p>
<p> The devices which are connected would be listed, and you need to have the device unlocked or the installation would not happen. </p>
<p> fastboot devices </p>
<p> adb reboot bootloader </p>
<p> fastboot devices </p>
<p> flash-all.bat </p>
<p> The final command of flash-all.bat would confirm and a set of steps would occur in the command window, and the further process of installation would be done on your Nexus device, and after the reboot, you would be seeing the new Android version, i.e. Android L installed on your device. </p>
<p> For Mac Users </p>
<p> Here, it is not the command window but a terminal window which has to be opened in the ADB folder, and here, the command you need to enter in the terminal window is: </p>
<p> adb reboot bootloader </p>
<p> This should be followed by the following command in the Fastboot: </p>
<p> fastboot oem unlock </p>
<p> The other steps are similar to that for the Windows users, given above. </p>
<p> Note: If your device gets stuck, you need to long press the power button to turn Off the device and follow all the above instructions after restarting the device. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can check on whether the device has been updated or not from the path “Settings > About phone” where the firmware version will be mentioned as Android L </p>
<p> Do let us know in the comments section just in case if you face any issues in the process of firmware update. </p>

<p> How to install Official LineageOS 14.1 ROM For Moto G4 And G4 Plus </p>
<p> Motorola launched the Moto G4 and the Moto G4 Plus smartphones last year, and both of them are one of the most popular smartphones till date. They are priced competitively and offer great value for money as well. Talking about the specs, it is Octa-core (4×1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & 4×1.2 GHz Cortex-A53) Qualcomm MSM8952 Snapdragon 617. The Moto G4 comes in two variants i.e. 2GB RAM & 16GB/ 32GB of internal storage, whereas the Moto G4 Plus comes in three variants i.e. 2GB with 16GB internal storage or 3GB with 32GB internal storage or finally 4GB with 64GB of internal storage. It comes with Android 6.1 Marshmallow out of the box. </p>
<p> If you wish to get the latest version of Android, then your only option is to install LineageOS 14.1. As you might already know, LineageOS is the same old CyanogenOS, and it is just a name change since the company has been acquired by Lineage. And since it is pretty much the same software, we don’t really have to worry about the reliability of the same, and we ca proceed with the instalaltion. </p>
<p> About the ROM </p>
<p> The LineageOS as you all know comes with a couple of customization options which is otherwise not found in the stock Android. At the same time, it is highly optimized as well and should work completely fine on your device. The battery performance is also on point, and you don’t have to worry about quick battery drain, etc. The interface also closely resembles that of the stock Android, and it is a very good overall user experience. Before you go ahead and install the ROM, there are certain Prerequisites to take care of and they are listed down below. </p>
<p> Prerequisite </p>
<p> The first step of this particular setup is to make sure that you are installing a custom recovery software since it is absolutely necessary for the installation. </p>
<p> You also need to have the bootloader of your smartphone unlocked in order to proceed with the installation. </p>
<p> Once all this done, it is also necessary that you create a backup of your data as well as the previous ROM so that you can restore it if anything goes wrong. </p>
<p> Make sure that you have at least 50-percent battery on your smartphone before you proceed with the installation. If the smartphone’s battery drains during the installation, then you may end up with a completely bricked smartphone as well. </p>
<p> And the last thing which you need to do is download the LineageOS file as well as GApps, which you need to install at the end. </p>
<p> Installation </p>
<p> Assuming that you have downloaded the files from the link given above, we can now start the installation and proceed with the same. </p>
<p> The first step is to make sure that you copy the files which you have downloaded into the SD card. </p>
<p> Now simply turn off your device and enter into the recovery mode. You can do this by pressing Volume Down + Power Key at the same time. </p>
<p> Now fast mount the partitions: Data, Cache, System. </p>
<p> Now once that is, done, it is time to wipe your device and clear the old ROM. You can do this by going into ‘wipe and format option ⇒ wipe data, system, cache and Dalvik cache’ via the custom recovery software. </p>
<p> Once done, navigate to LineageOS 14_1.zip file which you copied in the first step. </p>
<p> Now Swipe to flash it and this should begin the installation. </p>
<p> Once the installation is done, it is now time to install GApps as well and the procedure for that also remains the same. </p>
<p> Once both the installation is done, you can reboot your device. </p>
<p> Do make a note that the first reboot may take more time than usual since it has to initiate all the files, etc. Hence we suggest you to be patient with the same. With that said, if you have any queries on this, then be sure to let us know by commenting down below and also be sure to stay tuned to Android Advices for tutorials like this. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> How To Install And Run Android 4.0 ICS on Windows PC </p>
<p> Running Android OS on your PC gives some possibilities to do stuff more than what you could, on the device itself and the Android PC installation would make it a way for developers to get easy hands on the Android OS and do the several development and for many, just to try out the interface without having to purchase a device. Android ICS was one of the major change in the interface since the Android 2.3 Gingerbread, and below we share the guide on how you can install that OS on your Windows based computer, of course as a Virtual Layer and not a separate Dual boot OS. </p>
<p> The Android 4.0 ICS can be run through a free virtualization tool called VirtualBox, which just like many other tools, would create a platform to run an OS on the currently running PC OS, without having to switch between the two at boot up. </p>
<p> Follow the below tutorial, and yes you would need some good internet connectivity to download those few installation files and the extensions packs for the ICS to run on the PC. </p>
<p> Go to the Oracle VM VirtualBox website to download the VirtualBox binary for your OS, and as a matter of fact, this can be installed on even the Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris PC. Download the file and install it, and as we are talking about the Windows PC, the screenshots are for that OS to make it easier to understand. Follow the onscreen instructions to install the VirtualBox on your PC. </p>
<p> Now, head over to the VMLite site where you would find the Ice Cream Sandwich file which is made compatible to run on the Virtual layer, and which has got all the support for the mouse for navigation through the interface. It’s a file of around 89mb of size. Extract the downloaded file, and locate the file “VMLite-Android-v4.0.4” which has to be selected from the VirtualBox, or you would choose to open it directly and select VirtualBox as the program to run the file. </p>
<p> Go to VirtualBox and from the “Machine” menu, select “Add” and that would open the file manager, where the VMLite-Android-v4.0.4 file has to be selected. The VirtualBox would recognize the file as Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.4 version. </p>
<p> Select VMLite-Android-v4.0.4 from the left list, and then click on “Start” on the top to start the OS. For many, it would directly start the Android OS on the VirtualBox, but for some, they would need to have a few extension packs installed for the correct functionality, which include the USB 2.0 Host Controller, without installing which the Virtualization won’t start. </p>
<p> Head to the VirtualBox website which you had previously opened, and download the “VirtualBox 4.2.16 Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack” which is a file of around 20mb in size. Open it and it would automatically install it on the VirtualBox. If you don’t see any USB 2.0 Host error, you can directly proceed without downloading this extension pack. </p>
<p> Clicking on Start would do the series of processes and notifications as given below, before starting the actual Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich OS. </p>
<p> And here’s the Android 4.0.4 running on the VirtualBox, which is nothing more than an interface that would give you a basic OS install and nothing much in the functionality, because there’s no Play Store for you to try out any apps. But you can launch the apps which are already available, and you can browse the Internet with the Browser given. It’s not as smooth as the one in the actual device but good enough to provide an experience. </p>
<p> The About Tablet page shows this is the Android 4.0.4 OS running on the x86 PC through VirtualBox. There are even the virtualization files for the Android 4.1 and 4.3 Jelly Bean, the process for which would be shared soon. </p>

<p> I got an error msg “some program might be trying access hardware directly” and stops the process… what should i do now? </p>
<p> Sorry …. But There is no network availability to the virtual machine and say me about command prompt s:::.’.;.;.’;.’.something to do with that!!!!!!1 </p>
<p> It’s ok, I had to delete everything as apparently is looks for the same ID as it had when it closed the next time you start it? Deleted everything and didn’t even get prompted for the extensions this time? Weird? </p>
<p> Anyway, thank you for much for the interesting blog/information and also many thanks for taking the time to reply. </p>
<p> I installed it last night and ICS loaded ok. The error was the extensions pack? </p>
<p> I got back home tonight and uninstalled vbox, downloaded again, tried to install ICS and get an error now? Cannot Finf an open hard disk with UUID (then a row of numbers separated by ‘-‘ and it’s enclosed in braces? </p>
<p> Which part are you saying “doesn’t work”? Installing the “Virtual Box” software or the “Ice Cream Sandwich ” file? </p>
<p> This doesn’t work at all on win7, as I cannot get it started. I get errors when installing the extensions, so it won’t run? </p>
<p> ICS on Windows via VM was wonderful! Also, can we have applications installed, it says “You don’t have any device” </p>
<p> you either need to create a virtual environment or you will have to create a base IDAM profile in the ADB </p>

<p> Install Ubuntu on Xoom – Mount Linux OS on Tablet </p>
<p> So, how many of you thought of upgrading the firmware on your Motorola Xoom? So, quite a few of you, right? So, let’s check out how you can install an all new operating system in your Motorola Xoom right away. If you are having Motorola Xoom, then let’s check out on how you can install a PC based operating system which is none other than the king of Open source, Ubuntu. With the help of simple instructions, you can easily update your Motorola Xoom with the latest Ubuntu. But before proceeding to the updation process you will have to make sure that you have created a backup of all the data on your computer as in an unlikely event you may lose all the data in your Motorola Xoom. </p>
<p> Pre installation instructions: </p>
<p> Please note that we are not responsible in any manner if anything goes wrong with your Motorola Xoom and this upgrade instructions are only for developers or beta testers who are comfortable with the rooting and testing new things. </p>
<p> Ensure that Xoom has a minimum free space of 2.5GB as the files which will be installed in the Xoom will be of 600+ MB but will expand an up to 2.5GB of size. </p>
<p> Procedure to install Ubuntu in Motorola Xoom: </p>
<p> So, now as soon as you download the zip file, you will have to extract the files of this folder to AndroidSDK/tools/ </p>
<p> Next up, you will have to copy the files which are Busy box as well as the installbusybox.sh files to the root of the SD Card in your Motorola Xoom which you can do that manually by connecting the Xoom with the computer with the help of USB Cable. Also, make sure that you have enabled the USB Debugging Mode in your Motorola Xoom which can be done by going into the Settings > Applications > Development. You can also copy the files with the help of ADB Push which can be done by following the below instructions, </p>
<p> In Mac, open the terminal window first and after that just change the directory to AndroidSDK/tools after which just type in /adb push busybox /sdcard. </p>
<p> After this type in /adb push installbusybox.sh as well as /sdcard. </p>
<p> Next up type in /adb shell so that you will get the access to the device. </p>
<p> Now, you need to type in the “su” so that you can now get the super user privileges, please note that if you get any errors or notification like ”Permission Denied” then that means that your Motorola Xoom is not at all rooted, so you will have to re root the Motorola Xoom. </p>
<p> After getting the super user privileges, now you need to type in “cd/sdcard” which will change the directory to the device’s SD Card and then you can access your SD Card and then you will have to type in sh installbusybox.sh </p>
<p> That’s it as soon as this process is completed, you will now have to enter the command as “cp” and need to check whether it displays anything, if it doesn’t display anything then you will have to enter the command as “/adb reboot” and then you will have to enter in the command as “cp”. </p>
<p> So, now once the Busybox is installed successfully, you can now move the files into the Ubuntu folder without the two files which are Busy box and installbusybox.sh. If you are comfortable with the adb push then you can follow the below mentioned commands. </p>
<p> In the terminal window, you will have to enter the command as /adb push fsrw /sdcard/Ubuntu after which it will open the folder of Ubuntu. </p>
<p> Now, type in /adb push mountonly /sdcard/Ubuntu and as soon as the data transfer is completed it will notify the same on screen. </p>
<p> After this type in /adb push ubuntu.sh /sdcard/Ubuntu and after that /adb push ubuntu.img /sdcard/Ubuntu. Now, after this command it will take quite a while as the file size is very huge and may even take up to a maximum of 45 minutes, so you are advised to be patient as if you interrupt the process then there is a high probability that you may lose all the data. </p>
<p> Now, type in the commands, /adb push unionfs /sdcard/Ubuntu which will tell you once the data transfer is finished. </p>
<p> Now, you again have to go to shell and then need to type in the following commands, but for first up going into the Shell, you need to type in /adb shell. </p>
<p> Type in the following commands </p>
<p> Su </p>
<p> Cd/sdcard/Ubuntu </p>
<p> Sh./Ubuntu.sh </p>
<p> Now, after keying in the commands which are mentioned above, you will see some errors as it gets to “To enter the Debian Linux Console type in ‘boot ubuntu’”, you should be good and there you go after this you will see that the Ubuntu is successfully installed in your Motorola Xoom. </p>
<p> But this doesn’t stop here, you need to now gain the access to the installed Ubuntu, so let’s check out on how you can do so. So, for that, type in bootubuntu after which you will see a line which will say “root@localhost:/” after that the ububtu will run and now enter su bootububtu command and then enter the command again as bootubuntu. </p>
<p> Procedure to Setup Ubuntu on Motorola Xoom after installation process: </p>
<p> Now, when you are still seeing the message that is root@localhost entry which means that you have now got down at the Ubuntu’s terminal from the previous Android’s terminal program. Now, just like any other Android operating system version, ubuntu too has its own set of updates, to get these or to set the updates in ubuntu its very simple. Just type in the apt-get update. </p>
<p> Since Android is the main operating system on here and Ubuntu has nothing to display on, we are going to output X windows (The GUI Linux OSs) to VNC. Type in apt-get install tightvncserver </p>
<p> Once tightvncserver is installed, type in apt-get install lxde after which just type in export USER=root </p>
<p> Type in vncserver -geometry 1280×800 (Resolution of the Xoom’s display. You can experiment to find a resolution you like.. you can type this command whenever to change the resolution) </p>
<p> After this it should ask you for a password for your VNC… you can use something simple like 123 since you are the only one who can access it since it is only on your device. </p>
<p> Now, next up you will have to make some setting changes so that the VNC Experience turns out to be better and speedy which can be configured by keying in the below commands. </p>
<p> Type in cat > /root/.vnc/xstartup Type in #!/bin/sh Type in xrdb $HOME/.Xresources Type inxsetroot -solid grey Type in icewm & Type in lxsession </p>
<p> Press CNTRL+D, and then enter the below mentioned commands as mentioned below </p>
<p> cat > front export USER=root cd / rm -r -f tmp mkdir tmp cd / vncserver -geometry 1280×800 </p>
<p> Now, next up type in CNTRL+D again, and enter the below mentioned commands as it is, </p>
<p> cat front /root/.profile > temp #Thanks David Tangye </p>
<p> cp temp /root/.bashrc </p>
<p> Now you can exit out of the Ubuntu terminal which can be done by typing exit in the terminal. </p>
<p> Now, after this the Motorola Xoom will be rebooting and after that from the Android Market Place you will have to download the VNC application which is Android VNC and also additionally you will have to download the app called Terminal Emulator Pro for 4$ or Android Terminal Emulator which is the free application. </p>
<p> Now you can use the ADB shell again, but I suggest doing this on the device using one of the Terminal Emulators. </p>
<p> cd /sdcard/ubuntu </p>
<p> su (If the Superuser app asks for permission, press yes) </p>
<p> bootubuntu </p>
<p> OK, you should see the same thing as you did on your computer screen. Now go back to your homescreen, and open your VNC client. </p>
<p> Now, in the Nickname spot, put ‘Ubuntu’ or whatever you want. </p>
<p> In the password spot, put whatever you put for a password earlier. </p>
<p> Leave the address blank. </p>
<p> Set the port at 5901. </p>
<p> Set the color format to 256 colors (1 bpp) for the best results.Then you press the Connect button, and you are on Ubuntu! </p>
<p> So, in this way you can configure the two operating systems in your Android laden Motorola Xoom simultaneously but this could be dangerous if the things are not properly configured or commanded properly by the above method as also this voids the warranty. Don’t forget to configure the Internet Settings for accessing the Internet as well as the 3G settings as without that you wont be able to surf the internet and for the controls on ubuntu, just tap the same to make use of Click option, double tap on the icon to enjoy the option of right clicking and also you can switch the Ubuntu On and Off by clicking the home button or even with the help of task manager you can flip between the two different OS. </p>

<p> The iPhone 4 Versus Android Phones </p>
<p> This is not an easy thing to write about as the iPhone is a standalone product and Android phones are released by a variety of manufacturers. It is also specific on the carrier as to which deal is the best. However, Android phones are designed to work on a variety of networks where the iPhone (unless jail broken and hence voiding the warranty) is specific to a single carrier. In this regard, Android phones do trump the iPhone. However, there is a variety of other things to consider in regards to the iPhone versus an Android phone. I have disregarded the carriers in order to come up with an impartial comparison based upon factors such as price and functionality. </p>
<p> Price </p>
<p> This is probably one of the most important aspects considered when shopping for a smart phone. There are other smart phones out there that are not specific to the Android or iPhone niche that are likely to be cheaper. However, they do not for the basis of this article. To start with, the iPhone 4 retails for around $199 USD (or $299 for the 32 GB model). The Droid incredible retails for the same price. The Evo 4G follows suit at the same price (after rebate) and the Nexus One is right at the end of the price spectrum retailing for a whopping $529 USD (if you are not on a contract. So you are getting a fairly comparable price range if you don’t take into the account the Nexus One. </p>
<p> Apps </p>
<p> The iTunes App Store has over 215,000 apps available for download. Many of these you need to pay for (well, most of the decent apps you need to pay for). Apps developed for the Android platform are not all free but many of them are. At present there are around 70,000 apps available on the Android app Market. So the iPhone wins in sheer number of apps. However, a lot of these apps are pretty useless and are not going to be used by any self-respecting user. Many of the apps are games as well and cost money – although Apple have pretty stringent quality control measures in regards to what is released on their App Store. The Android market place varies as well in terms of the quality of the apps. The Android Market offers a lot of free apps as well. It is really up to the consumer as to who is the winner in regards to apps. I dare say (in my humble opinion) that Apple probably wins this round. </p>
<p> Functionality </p>
<p> This is where it gets interesting. All phones have comparable functionality. It is also up to the manufacturer in regards to what type of camera and how the functions work in regards to the Android phones. The iPhone 4 has a 5 megapixel camera. The Nexus One also has a 5 megapixel camera. The Droid and the Evo both have 8 megapixel cameras. The iPhone 4 has a higher screen resolution than all of these cameras. However, it also has the smallest screen. All phones have video recording functionality. </p>
<p> I have barely scratched the surface with this article. There is likely to be more factors than those discussed when making your decision. At a brief glance I prefer the Droid Incredible out of all of these phones. Again, this is a personal preference. </p>

<p> How to Get iPhone Photos App on Android Smart Phones iGallery App – Download Apk </p>
<p> Android is the most successful mobile platform at the moment because of the ability of the open platform which allows every developer freedom to develop apps. But iPhone even with all the restrictions is one platform due to the quality of iPhone from Apple which makes the user interface one to drool on. With all the benefits from android which allows you to edit and make your phone into a completely new platform in every aspect like camera apps, user interface, home screen, keyboard etc we are now discussing about Photo Gallery apps in Android. </p>
<p> Out of all the apps which we have tried i never felt anything could get close to the iPhone custom Photos Gallery interface and the look. But alas i had an Android phone with way better apps and tweaks which are way too much to sacrifice for just a better looking photos Gallery. But we recently came across an app which mimics the iPhone Gallery named as – iGallery which will bring your much loved iPhone gallery app to your Android Smartphone. </p>
<p> iGallery app mimics all the features and user interface of the iPhone photos gallery and brings it to your Android phone. With the app in its early stages of development we can find many flaws in every aspect of the app including the spelling mistakes. The developer says all the mistakes will be dealt with in the second upgrade including Picasa integration and compatibility with Jelly bean. </p>
<p> iGallery App has the following features </p>
<p> Options to adjust the size of the pictures and Video Screen. </p>
<p> Options to help you choose on how to sort order your pictures and Videos </p>
<p> Option which lets you get a confirmation pop up before deleting a picture or video </p>
<p> Option to edit the way Slideshow looks, with the number of images we can see the transition time and type and how much of each image is seen can also be decided. </p>
<p> Hot to Install iGallery App in Android </p>
<p> Go to Settings in your android Smartphone. </p>
<p> Then go into Applications. </p>
<p> Now you have to download the APK file of the iGallery App. </p>
<p> Now you will be getting the option to install the app which should be approved and install the app and enjoy the awesome Gallery like iPhone in your Android mobile phone. </p>
<p> I would suggest you to wait for the 2.0 version of the app and install it which will give you better options and correct all the above mentioned mistakes from the app interface. The only problem as of now with this application is that it is not available through the Google Play Store, and you need to download the APK file separately from a 3rd party website and install it. But that little work and knowledge is must when you want something that functions better than what comes by default. </p>
<p> The next version of the app would be probably getting in the support of Google Picasa, and it would be made compatible to work with the Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean versions of the Android OS. Along with that, there would be a support for various themes to give a brushed look. </p>

<p> The ministers do not know what they are talking about. </p>
<p> This is only to show the people they are bringing extraordinary schemes to help the poor. </p>
<p> Actually, the budget allotted is drained off by these politicians and this will carry on for years till the gadget is available (or dropped). </p>
<p> Right said, but the sakshat tablet was clearly a chinese product shown as a product by Indian IIT Students i guess. </p>
<p> Even I am confused with Indian government announcement and launches. Sakshat was announced a more than a year back. There were recent news that the first contract was cancelled and they have appointed alternative for it. With that they promise to launch by July August 2011. No news from them. </p>
<p> This is not about the Sakshat which was a joke itself. This is a real tablet which is available for all. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> JioMusic Vs Gaana Vs Wynk Vs Apple Music Vs Google Play Music – Which is the best Music App? </p>
<p> Over the past few years, Music streaming in India has become one of the hottest digital categories. All thanks to the shutdown of most popular torrent websites and also thanks to shifting in consumer mindset to opt for listening music via legal sources like JioMusic, Gaana, Wynk, Saavn and Apple Music. </p>
<p> With almost over a Billion people already connected with the mobile services in India with an average internet usage of 6.5GB/1.28GB/1.29GB/1.32GB on Jio/Airtel/Vodafone/Idea operators per month. There is a huge surge seen in digital services consumption and from which music streaming has a considerable share. </p>
<p> With the introduction of Free services by Reliance Jio, many 1st time Internet users have joined the club of internet and majority of this audience has chosen to go with online music streaming services. So let’s check out an app which stands out from almost half a dozen of music streaming apps in India. </p>
<p> Gaana: Gaana music streaming service promises to offer over 10 Million songs and was launched 7 years back. With over 10 Million app downloads in Google Play Store and claims to have over 50 Million music listeners. This app offers music preference from over just 10 Languages. </p>
<p> Key Features: Gaana comes with the decent interface with great animation but lacks in content packaging and numerous ads further deteriorate the experience. Apart from Hindi and English, content packaging is not that great as it lacks most of the widely used categories. The only good thing as per user comments in Play Store and as per our analysis is the type and number of playlists which is still to be matched by other incumbent music streaming players. Other features are; ++ Offline Downloads (Available to only Paid Users), ++ Supports only 5 devices for Premium Users ++ Light/Dark Theme options ++ Equalizer Support, ++ High-Quality Music (only available to Paid users) ++ Offers app in multiple Indian languages </p>
<p> Availability, Subscription & App Rating: Gaana has Free as well as Paid tier. While Gaana free tier offers music streaming via smartphone and Web platforms of all the songs, paid tier offers additional benefits like offline downloads in 5 devices and High-Quality music at 320Kbps. This app is available for Android, iOS, TIZEN and also for Web/ STB platforms. App rating of Gaana is 4.2/5 stars and also ranks 3rd and Music Streaming Free category. Gaana ranks 57th in Top Free apps in All apps category. </p>
<p> Cons: ++ Lot of ads in Free version ++ Music library needs improvement especially in Regional languages </p>
<p> JioMusic: With over 14Million songs on JioMusic to choose from various genres and moods, this app is one of undoubtedly giving tough to incumbent music apps. With just less than 6 Months of its launch, JioMusic managed to achieve over 10 Million downloads as per Google Play Store and is also ranked as No.1 Music app from over 32Weeks in Free Music apps category. </p>
<p> Key Features: Apart from simple to use interface, JioMusic also comes with brilliant content curation among all other music apps and that too in over 15 Languages. Apart from just providing free music streaming and offline downloads, this app also comes with JioTune feature. With JioTune, Jio customer can set/ change caller tune unlimited times without any charges. This app also has the least app size among all music apps. From the content packaging perspective, be it Hindi, English or even Assamese, music curation is widest in all the languages. Other Key features are; </p>
<p> ++ Offline Downloads in Unlimited Devices ++ High Quality HD Music with 320Kbps ++ Ad-Free ++ Radio with Unlimited Skips ++ Light/ Dark Theme options ++ Equalizer Support ++ Set any favorite song as your Jio Caller Tune (Catalogue of over 4 Lac. songs) ++ Tap Settings – Tap to Play/ Tap to Queue </p>
<p> Availability, Subscription & App Rating: Compared to other music apps, this app is only available to Jio subscribers. When it comes to subscription, all monthly and long duration recharge packs comes bundled with FREE JioMusic subscription which essentially means that JioMusic provides access to Premium Music experience for Free. This app is available for Android, iOS and TIZEN users and not available on Web/ STB platform. </p>
<p> JioMusic has highest app rating among any music app in India as it has not just a rating of 4.5/ 5 Stars but also is No.1 & most popular Music app in terms of app downloads from last over 35 weeks as per App Annie. As per Google Play Store comments, this app is rated highest mostly on the basis of design and content curation. </p>
<p> Cons: ++ Available only to Jio customers ++ Not available in Web/ STB platform </p>
<p> Wynk: Wynk Music claims to have just over 3 Million songs from over 12 Languages. Wynk has announced its services from Sep. 2014 and has over 10 Million app downloads and ranks as No.2 Music app just after JioMusic app in Free Music apps category. </p>
<p> Key Features: Wynk Music comes with a clean look just like JioMusic which also allows local music playback from this player and is one of the USP of this app. This app comes with free limited streaming and also offers the feature of Caller Tune where it allows Airtel users to set their favorite song as Hello Tune. This app lacks content from some labels and that’s for sure as most of the popular songs are not available on this platform. Other key features are; ++ Offline Downloads in 5 devices, ++ High Quality HD Music with 256/ 320Kbps, (Not all songs are in 320Kbps) ++ Local MP3 Music Playback support ++ Set any favorite song as Caller Tune (Catalog of around 3 Lacs.) ++ Tap Settings – Tap to Play/ Tap to Queue ++ Vernacular UI – Hindi </p>
<p> Availability, Subscription & App Rating: Wynk Music app is available for all users as it’s an OTT app. While this app is provided free of cost for Airtel subscribers, but pricing structure is very complex and for non-airtel subscribers, one has to pay Rs. 99/ month for enjoying the premium subscription. This app is available for Android & iOS and TIZEN users and also is available on the web. </p>
<p> Airtel’s Wynk ranks 58th in over all free music apps category while ranks 2nd in Top Free Music apps category. This app has a rating of just 4.2/5 stars. </p>
<p> Cons: ++ Large App Size and Highest Battery Consumption ++ Complex Pricing Structure ++ User experience in Web is lousy ++ Lacks popular songs and music from many labels </p>
<p> Apple Music: Apple Music which claims to be the leader in the world of music streaming post-Spotify seems like the worst of the lot especially in India. Just yesterday, Apple Music has rolled out an update which comes with the improved design, improved performance and Lyrics feature for limited songs. Apple Music offers best of the recommendation services and design experience but that’s where the good things end and it doesn’t solve the purpose of being a music app. Apple Music claims to have over 40 Million songs, but most of the Indian relevant content can’t be found in the app. </p>
<p> This app lacks content curation for regional and Bollywood content and fails to provide enough options for on-demand music listening. The reason of Rdio being shut in India is due to lack of on-demand music options. Except for the brand which comes from, Apple Music app in India is a complete fail and that’s why it’s not even there in Top 500 Android apps. </p>
<p> Key Features: In Apple Music, Beats 1 radio is the best among all music apps in India but only offers this for International Content. This app comes with the neat UI but lacks the placement of most popular and trending content upfront as most of them can only be found post using the search feature. The only star feature is the Lyrics feature in this app and apart from this other features are; ++ Offline Downloads in 5 devices, ++ High Quality HD Music with 320Kbps </p>
<p> Availability, Subscription & App Rating: Apple Music is a paid app which offers free 3 months trial and is available in Android, IOS and on the web via iTunes. When it comes to rating, Apple Music is worst of the lot as it just earns 3.4/5 Stars and nowhere ranks in the Top 500 Android apps. </p>
<p> Cons: ++ Highest App Size ++ Lacks popular songs and music from many labels </p>
<p> Google Play Music: Google Play Music has finally launched its Streaming service in India. With an initial trial period of 14 days, subscription can be then renewed for Rs. 89/ month. With over 40 Million songs, offering looks promising as of now. While app has agreements with almost all the labels except few like Aditya Music which is one of the biggest labels in South India. App has the biggest problem of content discoverability as Indian consumers look out for New Releases and Trending section the most which is missing from this app. This app lacks content curation for regional and Bollywood content and fails to provide enough options for on-demand music listening. When it comes to Google Play Music, its mostly popular of being playing side loaded music and not the streaming service. </p>
<p> Key Features: In Google Play Music, International curation is very good and also overall app design is simple. This app comes with the neat UI but lacks the placement of most popular and trending content upfront as most of them can only be found post using the search feature. Some of the main features of this new offering from Google Play Music are; ++ Offline Downloads in 5 devices, ++ High Quality HD Music with 320Kbps ++ Allows users to upload upto 50K songs ++ Ad-Free radio with unlimited skips </p>
<p> Availability, Subscription & App Rating: Google Play Music is a paid app which offers free 14 days trial and is available in Android and iOS platforms. When it comes to rating, Apple Music is worst of the lot as it just earns 3.9/5 Stars. </p>
<p> Cons: ++ Lacks popular songs and music from many labels ++ No Free Tier </p>

The launcher is ready to enter the testing process and Jolla is hunting for beta test volunteers of this app. Jolla is well known for its open Sailfish OS and Mer Core open source project This is a Chinese based company that came in to public with Sailfish in the year 2012. </p>
<p> The company is looking for some volunteers, who can help the Jolla team to test this launcher starting from next week. Moreover if you want to help them, you need to have at least a device that run Android 4.3 or higher and the company prefers the Nexus 4 or the Nexus 5 device. However it’s not a compulsion to have those Nexus Smart phones but you need to have any devices that run Android 4.3 Jelly Bean or higher. </p>
<p> So if you like to test this app and you meet the mention criteria then you need to follow the steps that are mentioned below. Send a email to the address – launcher@jolla.com from the Google account and if you do not have one you can just create a new one and send the details like Your name, Place and the device that you are using.

<p> JuiceDefender – Best Tool to Save Battery Power on Android Devices </p>
<p> As well as having an awesome name for an app – JuiceDefender is actually a very useful tool for prolonging the life of your battery. JuiceDefender doesn’t work with the aesthetics of your phone as such; it actually controls the connections to help save the power consumed with having the phone scouring various networks constantly. Your Android phone is constantly working for you. Checking your email and scouring the airwaves for connections. JuiceDefender allows you to have it scan what it needs to scan for new data at set intervals that you set. If you are sitting in front of a computer and use Gmail then you are likely to have Google Talk open anyway – so you aren’t going to really need to scan your email using your phone constantly. You can also set it up depending on a variety of other factors. </p>
<p> If your battery is getting low you can set JuiceDefender up to shut down non-essential services. You can also set it up to shut them down depending on the time of the day or when specific functions have been done. You can also set it up to shut down certain functions when the phone is situated in a certain place. For example, if your phone is out of range of any known networks – you can set it up to shut down the WiFi component of your Android phone. Pretty nifty! As far as scheduling goes, you can set it up to only broadcast and accept a signal at certain times of the day. If you don’t want to be woken up in the middle of the night by a message or phone call then you can set it up to shut down all connectivity during the night. If you work in any sort of emergency service then this is probably not a good idea. For the rest of us it is great. </p>
<p> JuiceDefender isn’t free – I should warn you – nor is it expensive. It is around $4 and for the price it is well worth it. If you combine it with other battery saving techniques you will find your battery charge will last as long as an extra day or two depending on how active your phone is when it does need to scan the airwaves for incoming or outgoing signals. It is also a good little timesaver. Some people hate being bothered with a barrage of emails constantly (me included) by setting it up to check email hourly it can help productivity as well. For the price of the app versus the amount of extra productivity and power you are saving the app virtually pays for itself. I should note that I am not affiliated with the developers – I actually do really find the app useful. </p>
<p> So if you find your battery power disappearing relatively fast and don’t want to be distracted with constant messages, email and calls when working – it is worth checking out. It is relatively simple to use and most of the functions have a nice little tool tip which explains what they do. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> JustPictures – A Nice little Imaging App for Android </p>
<p> Most Android phones come with a pretty nifty image viewer. However, that doesn’t stop you from wanting something a little more powerful or versatile in regards to the organisation and usability of an image viewer. The solution is pretty easy, check out JustPictures. JustPictures is available from the Android app Market and is compatible with many of the major image websites on the web (such as Flickr, SmugMug and Picasa Web Albums). However, it doesn’t stop there. JustPictures also integrates seamlessly with Facebook so you can easily upload images directly from your phone to your Facebook photo album. The buck doesn’t stop there however and you can access Facebook albums through the app to store them for quick access at a later date. </p>
<p> So essentially, JustPictures is a web enabled gallery program that specifically focuses on images. This is one of its strengths as well. The generic gallery software that comes with many Android phones actually sorts through all of the media in the memory. JustPictures focuses just on images and it does this well. I also find many gallery programs that come with Android phones a little jerky because they sort through all of the media on the device. Because JustPictures works with images it is quite snappy and responsive – even though it offers thumbnails for every image in the folders that they are stored in. It works with every version of Android however certain functions will only work with newer Android builds (such as the Live Wallpaper feature built into the software). </p>
<p> One of the nicer things about JustPictures is the price. It is free. So you need not pay a few extra dollars for what is an image viewer. Even though it is a pretty advanced image viewer because of its web related capabilities – it is a nice little addition to the apps on your Android device. If you use a tablet PC with Android installed then it is a perfect addition to the suite of apps because it really brings your photos to life. This is not a feature limited to Android tablet PCs – the software runs equally well on an Android phone despite the lesser amount of system resources set aside for image processing. </p>
<p> So check it out. You don’t have anything to lose besides a few minutes of your time. It is a relatively easy app to install and if you have ever installed an Android app you won’t have any trouble getting JustPictures onto your Android device. It is a must have app for those of us who use our devices to show off images to friends and families. It is also a great app for people who use the camera embedded in their Android device because it is easy to categorise images into relevant folders for easy retrieval. Add to this the ability to easily upload and download images to imaging sites and social networks and you have an all in one suite on your hands for the easy transferral and viewing of images. </p>

<p> How to Activate Kids Mode on Samsung Galaxy S5 (Features Explained) </p>
<p> The Kids Mode in the Samsung Galaxy S5 is something very interesting and good for those who really care about the content and personal stuff in the device, but don’t want to see their child disappointed on not being given the smartphone for playing around with it. The S5 is for everyone, and the Kids Mode is what vouches for it. The Kids Mode changes the entire interface of the smartphone, and makes it look like one of those toys for the kids with some options to play around with. </p>
<p> To activate the Kids Mode on Samsung Galaxy S5, you need to go to the home screen where there is a shortcut for the same, or you could locate that even in the app drawer. Initially, it would require you to download a file from the Internet for the installation, and once you install it, you would be asked to enter a Pin for you to enter the actual interface. </p>
<p> After that, you can enter the profile of your kid with all the details and select the apps which you wanted your kid to get access to, and even if you choose no app from there, there is a neat list of modified apps ready for the kids. </p>
<p> There are multiple home screens with some interesting apps listed on one, and a dinosaur doing some crazy stuff on the other. The kid has all the fun activities here, with the apps for camera, a painting tool, media player, voice recorder and player with different faces and actions etc. </p>

<p> The best part about this app is that the parent gets to see and understand what their kid has been doing on the phone, and which app was used the most frequently, in the last week or in the last month. This even gives the parents an idea on what they like and what they don’t. </p>
<p> The settings include the application permissions, the toggling of 3D tilting effect on the home screen, block key, changing of the parental PIN and also setting the daily playtime limit if you wanted your kid to spend only a set amount of time rather than using it for hours. </p>

<p> One enhancement would be the option in the general settings to deactivate the internet connection, i.e airplane mode so that added apps only run local and don’t prompt the child for account logins and video advertisements when playing. </p>

<p> Kies Software for Mac to Sync Galaxy Tab 10.1 Tablet Media </p>
<p> Finally the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1″ users would be happy if there are specially Apple Mac based users because Samsung has pushed a updated version of their Kies Software. You can download the software from Download Center for GT-P7510MAVXAB from here. There are manuals available in English and Spanish language along with software download links for Mac OS & Win XP/Vista/Windows 7 operating systems. </p>
<p> Samsung Kies is a software that enables you to update your device firmware, synchronize files, and transfer data to and from your device directly by connecting to the PC. You need to download the > MAC Kies Beta 1.0.0.11062_33 for MAC OS for Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 (GT-P7510) </p>
<p> All of the Samsung Galaxy devices like Galaxy S, Galaxy S 2 or be it the Galaxy Tab are connected with the Windows based computers through the Kies software only using which you can easily backup all the data onto your computer and then synchronize your media files like the music, photos & videos. This software sync option was not available to the Apple Mac OS based consumers hence this update can delight them. FYI, there is also a Kies Mini Application offered by Samsung. </p>

<p> It’s actually a great and useful piece of information. I am satisfied that you shared this helpful information with us. Please stay us informed like this. Thanks for sharing. </p>
<p> Downloaded Kies software and have reinstalled it twice so far and it still wont recognize my Samsung Galaxy Ace </p>
<p> Installed the driver and tried switching off the wifi, have even stood on one leg and held onto the heater whilst doing it but still wont recognize my Samsung Galaxy Ace </p>
<p> glewster…try turning off you wifi on your tab or phone…and if the modem detection thingy comes up again…just cancel it… </p>
<p> there is a nicer and better solution out there, called FoneSync for Samsung. It works like iTunes and will synchronise your contacts, calendars, iTunes playlists and iPhoto albums with your Mac and Android device. Kind regards, </p>
<p> Kies update still does not work. MAC sees it as some kind of modem. What are the settings? The default does not work. Did anyone confirm this? </p>

<p> Kingcom Padphone 61 Biggest Smart Phone Specs Features & Price </p>
<p> Kingcom Padphone is another Android Device in the market which is not just another Phone but claimed to be the Biggest Smart Phone yet considering its size of 6.1”. Probably thanks to all the success of the Samsung Galaxy Note Series like Note II & Note, following which Huawei has launched the Ascend Mate and other companies are also coming up with large screen devices. </p>
<p> The Padphone 61 is a tablet sized phone which comes with a 6” FWVGA display at 480×854 pixels resolution which is not very high but decent enough. Along with this it comes packaged with a 1 Ghz dual-core Mediatek processor and a 512MB Ram which should be sufficient for small applications but when running gaming applications the response should not be great. </p>
<p> The Padphone comes packed with 5Mp camera along with a 4Gb Internal Storage which can be expanded upto 32Gb via MicroSD. There is also a front facing camera of VGA quality which should be enough for video calling facility. The best part of this device is the pricing factor which is listed at $278 which is pretty cheap since its almost half the price of the other devices mentioned above and also gives you a decent tablet along with Phone calling facility. </p>
<p> Not to forget it comes with a Dual SIM feature ensuring that you can use two SIM cards at the same time which could be another reason to buy, while the 160 PPI makes the device a lower display resolution and would make many people avoid the device. Considering the above mentioned specifications and the disadvantages of low quality display and Android 4.0 would you opt for buy this just for the sake of price and large screen display or would you be willing to spend more and get a branded device? </p>
<p> The name looks similar to the Asus Padfone, while the size is around the other phablets in the market and the price is listed to be quite low but still the company is not a well known brand which could be one important reason we would not suggest you to buy this for your daily usage. </p>

<p> Kreyos Meteor – The SmartWatch with Voice & Gesture Control for Android & iOS </p>
<p> As soon as we talk something about a new product with a great technology, something else pops up which beats the previous one with some special inclusions. Same is the case with the new smartwatch Kreyos Meteor, which excels in a lot of stuff that is still called Smart and has a limited functionality in quite a few other devices. Talking about it, it’s the first SmartWatch in the interactive category which lets you use your voice and gesture controls to control the smartphone, all through the watch. </p>
<p> This Kreyos Meteor SmartWatch is already much anticipated, with the project on Indiegogo being funded almost 9 times what was being asked to kickstart it. When we talk about something that’s new in concepts, there’s comparisons, and looking at the sheet, one can easily see how the Meteor beats the Pebble SmartWatch, the Sony SmartWatch 2, Agent, Martian and the MetaWatch in many ways, primarily the hands-free voice and gesture controlling. </p>
<p> Kreyos Meteor SmartWatch Features </p>
<p> First off, we are mentioning about the SmartWatch because of its syncing and functionality possibilities with the Android smartphones. Syncing the watch with the smartphone would allow the following possible functions: </p>
<p> When connected to iPhone, activate Siri remotely </p>
<p> Making phone calls </p>
<p> Respond to Text Messages / SMS </p>
<p> Share / post on social networks – Facebook, Twitter </p>
<p> Reply and send Emails </p>
<p> Receive and reply to Notifications </p>
<p> Set up the Alarms and Appointments and Reminders </p>
<p> Access a few allowed applications </p>
<p> There’s no continuous syncing needed with the watch, as the Kreyos Meteor can keep time and do a few limited functions when the phone is disconnected. There are a few inbuilt widgets which can still function even if the phone is not connected. </p>
<p> The Kreyos Meteor would come with the free Kreyos app which would help in all the gesture controls, where shaking your hands while wearing the watch can help in some gesturing, and 3-axis gyroscope aids in that. There are four different wrist motions configured within the system of the Meteor, which are for the specific actions, and the functionality would be later on increased when the developers start integrating the gestures for functions within different applications. </p>
<p> All the controlling is done using the Bluetooth, thus you won’t need the smartphone always in your pocket. The connectivity on-the-go with the various smartphones with Android OS, the iPhone and Windows 8 devices helps in instant synchronization, and there’s a support to a total of 8 unicode languages. </p>
<p> Fitness with Kreyos Meteor Smartwatch </p>
<p> On the fitness side, Smartwatches are expected to provide some good support, and the Meteor is no exception with the waterproofing which helps swimmers, while there’s a lot for the runners, bikers and golfers too. Kreyos Meteor will work directly with bluetooth or ANT+ sensors without being connected to the smartphone. There’s a sports mode for people who wants to track their sporting activities, including the Walking, Running and Cycling. There’s various grid options. </p>
<p> The various options included under the the grid options: a) Total Workout time b) Time of the day c) Total Distance d) Altitude e) Elevation Gain f) Speed g) Average Speed h) Top Speed i) Pace j) Average Pace k) Calories Burned l) Current Heart Rate m) Average Heart Rate n) Max Heart Rate o) Current Lap Time p) Average Lap Time q) Best Lap Time </p>
<p> Kreyos Meteor SmartWatch Specifications </p>
<p> Ultra Low Power MCU </p>
<p> Ultra Low Power 1.26 Inch Memory LCD Screen 144 x 168 pixel </p>
<p> Bluetooth 2.1+ EDR and 4.0 (Low Energy) </p>
<p> Water Resistant MEMS Microphone with HIGH SNR and Flat Wide Band frequency response </p>
<p> Water resistant – Good for swimming and shower (ATMs: TBD) </p>
<p> 150 mah Lithium Rechargeable Battery (7 days battery life) </p>
<p> USB Interface for Charging and Watch OS Update </p>
<p> How do I get a Kreyos Meteor SmartWatch? </p>
<p> You can still get the watch for $129 which is the available option, because many of the other options are sold out, and there’s discounts for multiple watches ordered together. Check out the page on Indiegogo – Kreyos Meteor on Indiegogo. </p>
<p> There’s still 15 days left for the project funding to end, so get one for yourself before the time ends. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Lenovo A7000 Hands-on & First Impressions </p>
<p> The mid-range smartphone segment has seen tremendous growth over the last couple of months. There has been something of a flood in this range of smartphone, which is a good thing for consumers. To weigh in more, Lenovo has announced its latest mid-ranger, A7000, which is a sequel to A6000, the cheapest 4G LTE smartphone. We are at the launch event happening in New Delhi and got to play around with the device for few hours. This is our hands-on and first impressions of the device. </p>
<p> Design </p>
<p> The new Lenovo A7000 offers almost everything you can expect from a mid-range smartphone in 2015. Talking about the design, it has a polycarbonate build that looks and feels sturdy and solid. It gives a great feeling in the hand, which is certainly rare on a budget friendly mid-rangers. Those thin bezels on the sides of the display make a way for an easier handling experience. While at 7.9mm thickness and weighing around 140 grams means it is easy to hold the device. </p>
<p> Even though, the device is made out of plastic; it didn’t instantly turned into a smudge house, meaning the material used on the back is preferably matte. With large screen size, it was obligated to feel uncomfortable while holding the device, but we had reasonably opposite feelings when we hold the device, it was grippy and handled well for a 5.5-inch device. </p>
<p> Hardware </p>
<p> The A7000 features a 5.5-inch 720p IPS LCD display, which is certainly a good pixel per density considering the competition in the same price range. It comes packed with MediaTek MT6752m True8Core chipset that clocks at 1.5 GHz. Accompanying it is the ARM Mali-760 MP2 GPU and a 2GB of RAM. The combination should give a good overall performance. Talking about the internal storage on the device, it packs only 8GB of it but can be expanded up to 32GB via a microSD card. So, let’s not worry about the storage space, because it is in par with current competition going on in the Indian smartphone market. </p>
<p> In terms of the camera, the device sport an 8MP rear shooter with LED flash and a 5MP front shooter for selfies. When it comes to battery life, it lacks a little against competition with 2900mAh battery rating, opposed to 3000mAh on Xiaomi Redmi Note 4G and Huawei Honor 4X, while it has win over 2600mAh battery on the Yu Yureka. </p>
<p> The Interesting stuff that the company has bundled up with its latest mid-ranger is the Dolby Atmos sound technology, which is the first that any company would be offering on their smartphone. With this audio enhancement, users would be able to experience theatre like sound entertainment experience on their headphones. We didn’t get to test that today, but certainly looking forward to that once we start using it as daily driver. </p>
<p> Software </p>
<p> Lenovo has been great with its UI integration on their smartphones since the past couple of months. The Vibe UI (or Lenovo Launcher) doesn’t have a separate app drawer, and it also boasts some many other great interface features. It’s not the best Android skin out there in the market, but it certainly is not the worst. You can rely on its snappy performance, as well as neat looks that gives it something beautiful to offer. </p>
<p> Though, it is surprising to note that the device is based on the latest Android 5.0 Lollipop OS, it’s because it doesn’t take an influence from general aesthetic of the user interface of 5.0. But rather provides its highly customized skin on top taking over the scene. </p>
<p> Initial Thoughts </p>
<p> The A7000 is stuffed with a great set of hardware for a mid-range smartphone, and its biggest selling point is the budget-friendly price point of INR 8999. This would make a good addition to its portfolio of budget smartphones in India seating with A6000 and others. We would be testing the device for couple of days and would get back to you with full detailed review of the same. </p>

<p> Lenovo completes the acquisition of Motorola from Google – Details </p>
<p> Today Lenovo has completed the purchase of Motorola from Google. Google retains the ownership of the bulk of Motorola patent portfolio, with Lenovo getting a license to the patents. Some 2,000 patents and a large number of patent cross-licensing deals will go with Motorola to Lenovo. </p>
<p> Motorola will act as a wholly-owned subsidiary, retaining almost 3,500 employees, and will remain in headquartered in Chicago. Lenovo says it expects Motorola to become profitable in four to six quarters. </p>
<p> The total purchase price at close was approximately $2.91 billion, including approximately $660 million in cash and 519,107,215 shares of Lenovo stock, with an aggregate value of $750 million. The remaining $1.5 billion will be paid to Google by Lenovo in the form of a three-year promissory note. </p>
<p> Earlier – Lenovo buys Motorola for $2.91 Billion, confirms Larry Page – What is sold, what is retained </p>
<p> A very surprise move, did anyone see that coming? all of a sudden, Motorola doing so good under Google with the Moto X and Moto G to start with, has been sold to Lenovo for a sum of $2.91 billion. As the message from Google CEO Larry Page says, We’ve just signed an agreement to sell Motorola to Lenovo for $2.91 billion. As this is an important move for Android users everywhere, I wanted to explain why in detail. </p>
<p> Larry explained about the new owner in a few lines, saying that they would be retaining the Motorola brand as it is: Lenovo has the expertise and track record to scale Motorola into a major player within the Android ecosystem. They have a lot of experience in hardware, and they have global reach. In addition, Lenovo intends to keep Motorola’s distinct brand identity—just as they did when they acquired ThinkPad from IBM in 2005. Google will retain the vast majority of Motorola’s patents, which we will continue to use to defend the entire Android ecosystem. </p>
<p> But did you notice the last line there? that’s what Motorola was acquired by Google for earlier! The Patents. Google is going to retain the vast majority of Motorola’s patents, and thus, their job is done. Lenovo though won’t go with just the brand name in the deal, as it is going to receive 2,000 patent assets and the Motorola Mobility brand and trademark. </p>
<p> With regards to the payment for the deal, of that $2.91 billion, $1.41 billion will be paid at the close of the deal. $660 million will be comprised of US cash and $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares. The remaining $1.5 billion will be paid in the form of a three-year promissory note. </p>
<p> This is not the first sell-off of one of the parts of Motorola Mobility, because Google earlier had sold the cable box division for $2.4 billion. There have been reports that Motorola has been losing money every quarter in the consumer division, and thus Google better sold this than simply dumping the company, and this is a plus for Lenovo, the company which has been trying quite a lot to establish itself in the smartphone market, and they had reportedly submitted a bid to buy Blackberry in October (was rumored in October 2013), but the deal luckily didn’t go well. </p>
<p> This is not a very rare purchase from Lenovo, because in the recent times, this is what done by them: </p>
<p> Purchased IBM’s personal computer division for $1.25 billion – made itself the third largest computer maker with the purchase, and now has scaled up to become the largest PC shipping company in the world </p>
<p> 2013 2nd half – Lenovo overtook HP </p>
<p> Now Lenovo is planning to purchase IBM’s x86 server business for $2.3 billion. Although Google didn’t make good profits since the acquisition of Motorola, they would be happy to hold the patents and sell Motorola off, to a company which has some strong plans to grow itself. </p>
<p> What else it retained by Google? </p>
<p> Apart from the vast majority of patents, the Motorola’s Advanced Technology and Projects group will be staying with Google. The Project Ara and such projects are part of this, and will be a part of Google. The entire group under this, including the leader Regina Dugan will be moved to Google to the team run by Sundar Pichai. </p>
<p> Hold your Moto X or Moto G and now think, did you buy this because you thought it was being made under the eyes of Google? doesn’t matter much but still, we are sure many had purchased their Moto for this reason. </p>

The portion where the screen is viewable can also act as a notification centre where you will get notified on incoming calls, text messages, emails, and so on. The covers come in four different colours namely Eggy (Yellow), Wookie (White), Soul (Blue) and YoYo (Pink). </p>
<p> LG AKA has a 5-inch IPS display with 720×1280 pixels resolution. It is powered by a quad-core 1.2GHz processor (unspecified) with 1.5GB of RAM.

<p> LG sending Android KitKat Update to L9 II and G Pro Lite – Details </p>
<p> LG has put its foot on the accelerator and as we expected, it has pushed the KitKat update to its L9 II and G Pro Lite handsets directly, skipping the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean update. This is an interesting move by the company and it might be due to the heavy competition in the Smart phone market and the company would not like to sit back and relax unlike the other brands which are ignoring the update for the high-end devices. This will be exciting news for the L9 II and G Pro Lite smart phone users as they might have expected the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean update for their device as they came out of the box with Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. </p>
<p> The Optimus L9 II that was announced last year in the month of August, went for sale in the month of October, this mid range device be getting the Android 4.4.2 KitKat update in the coming weeks and it was confirmed by an Italian blog called as Androidani. The information was confirmed by the LG Italian officials and also claimed that the LG G2 will also be receiving an update in the coming weeks. Reports from Slovakia claim that the update has already started hitting their L9 II device. </p>
<p> The LG G Pro Lite will be receiving the Android 4.4.2 KitKat update in the second quarter of this year and the Optimus G is listed for the update in the third quarter. This update will be bringing the latest version of Android with the stability improvements and some bug fixes with performance boost. Most important is that these devices will be receiving the LG’s Knock code feature that lets you unlock your device just by tapping on the screen in a pattern. The Optimus G, G Flex and the LG G2 also received this as an update. </p>

It has a 32 GB internal storage which can be further expandable via microSD card slot and 3 GB RAM. </p>
<p> The device supports dual SIM dual standby and offers Cat.9 LTE with 3CA support, which is the same we have seen on the LG G5 Speed.

<p> LG Display Develops World’s Thinnest Full HD Smartphone Bezel – Details </p>
<p> Today LG Display has announced that they have developed the world’s thinnest FHD smartphone bezel. LG Display has developed a 5.3-inch Full HD LCD panel for smartphones with the world’s narrowest bezel at 0.7mm. </p>
<p> To realize the 0.7mm bezel width on the left and right sides of the panel, LG Display has used its “Neo Edge” module processing technology and the world’s first “Advanced In-Cell Touch (AIT)” technology. </p>
<p> LG Display used new technology called “Neo Edge” which uses an adhesive instead of double-sided tape to attach and seal the total area and edges of the panel’s circuit board and backlight unit. Because there is no plastic guide panel to attach the panel and backlight, the Neo Edge technology helps achieves minimal bezel width. It also helps in blocking light leakage and makes the display waterproof and dustproof. </p>
<p> The adhesive seal also prevents corrosion that sometimes occurs along the edge of the glass panel when double-sided tape is used. This is dramatically improving the panel’s durability despite the narrow bezel because of increased elasticity as the adhesive hardens. </p>
<p> The company’s AIT technology, exclusively developed by LG Display, reduces the need for bezel space because the touch panel is embedded into the LCD module. The technology offers a slim design and excellent touch, while saving costs since a separate process for touch functions is not required. </p>
<p> Last year LG came with its slimmest 5.2-inch 1080p smartphone display. The panel was 5.2 inches long 2.2mm thick and had a 2.3mm bezel. Few months back Sharp and Softbank has announced two new smartphones, Aquos Crystal and Aquos Crystal X. Both Aquos Crystal smartphones sported incredibly thin bezels, the 5.5″ Aquos Crystal X measuring just 139 x 73 x 11mm, making it much smaller than the 5.5″ LG G3 146.3 x 74.6 x 8.9 mm. </p>
<p> LG Display will begin mass production of its new smartphone panel in November and will be supplying customers in China first. LG Display has not revealed any details on which device will be the first to use this new ultra-thin bezel as yet. </p>

<p> LG firmware update to bring Knock Code feature – Details </p>
<p> We have seen the Knock code feature coming up with the LG G Pro 2 that was unveiled at the MWC 2014 held last month in Spain. Now LG has announced that it will be bringing this new feature to its other earlier launched Smart phones with a firmware update that will be starting in the month of April. This Knock code is a unique feature that will be letting you to unlock your Smart phone with a customized knock pattern. </p>
<p> This feature is already present in the F series, L Series III devices and also in the LG G2 mini. The company noted that the LG G2 and G Flex users will be receiving this Knock code update first, in selected countries and later it will roll out to other devices. The company introduced the KockOn feature in the LG that was invented long back in the year 2008, that provides more convenience and greater security over the other password and pattern based security passwords. </p>
<p> LG explained in details, how this Knock Code feature work – Smartphone display is divided into four invisible quadrants. User taps or “knocks” anywhere from two to eight times in the quadrants in a specific sequence. With more than 80,000 possible combinations and no fingerprint streaks, Knock Code offers a level of security far greater than other devices, even those with fingerprint recognition systems. And because Knock Code can be implemented anywhere on the screen in any size without having to view the screen, there’s no chance of password theft. </p>
<p> We are not sure of the exact date of the roll out, but the company has said that it will be starting in the month of April. So do you own a LG Smart phone? Waiting for the Knock Code feature to hit your device? Is this the best way to unlock your Smart phone? Do comment and stay tuned for more information and updates. </p>

<p> I hope we receive the update asap cos Africa is usually last to receive updates like I’m still waiting for the KitKat update to arrive to Cell C in South Africa and then when it does arrive how would one do the update through LG pc Suite or through settings and the update centre </p>

<p> LG G2 Camera Samples – Natural & Low Light, Indoors, HQ Photos </p>
<p> The LG G2 Android smartphone comes with the 13-megapixel camera and there’s a lot of innovation with this device coming in, because a totally new design where the side keys moved to the back panel, but all that doesn’t look the best, except the camera which delivers one of the best quality pictures a smartphone camera can produce. Thanks to the Optical Image Stabilization, the captures by LG G2 are quite good. </p>
<p> The camera app has got a big list of options and effects to play around with, but that doesn’t mean you might have to use it always because the Superior Auto mode would do the best job in bringing out good natural shots. The different resolutions and aspect ratios of the pictures captured, as included as follows: </p>
<p> 10-megapixel wide: 4160 x 2340 pixels (16:9) </p>
<p> 8-megapixel: 3264 x 2448 pixels (4:3) </p>
<p> 1-megapixel: 1280 x 960 pixels (4:3) </p>
<p> The shutter responds to voice where a call of “Cheese” would capture a picture, and the other options in settings include the Brightness, Focusing, ISO, White Balance, Color Effect etc. but if you aren’t sure of all this, the Superior Auto mode is the best you can use. </p>
<p> The best one can zoom is to 8x, and the camera focus automatically to 9 different points when needed or select some moving objects individually and focuses on them. In the end, it’s the LG G2 camera which seems to be quite better than the other two in the comparison – Galaxy Note 3 Camera & Sony Xperia Z1 Camera. </p>

<p> I have an LG G2 White 32 GB. In low light conditions or sepia-ish light (the browish tint one, I don’t know what’s it called), the camera isn’t able to focus on the subject properly. I have to enable the flash so that it can focus and well, that sort o’, ruins the image quality. Otherwise, in every other aspect, the camera is like any SLR out there. I’d really appreciate if you let me know what’s the thing and is it a problem with all droids/phones. </p>

<p> LG G2 Vs Galaxy S4 Vs Moto X Smart Phone Comparison </p>
<p> It was quite much considered that the Samsung Galaxy S4 topped the list of the best smartphones for this year, although there are some competitors like the HTC One, the Sony Xperia Z, but will it be on the top of the league after LG has come up with their flagship device, LG G2? Or even after the recent release of the Moto X from Motorola, which is a sole product from Google? Let’s see below. </p>
<p> LG G2 vs Samsung Galaxy S4 vs Moto X Smartphone Comparison </p>
<p> Display, Screen and External Form Factor </p>
<p> The LG G2 has been announced with the 5.2-inch screen, compared to the slightly smaller 5-inch one in the S4, and this is quite bigger than all the flagship devices announced by the different brands this year. The display in both is a Full HD one with the 1920 x 1080 pixels screen resolution. While it is the IPS display in the G2, the display in the S4 is a Super AMOLED one. Compared to these two, the Moto X is quite smaller with the 4.7 inch touchscreen which comes with the 720p AMOLED display. </p>
<p> The design is where the G2 and S4 differ a lot, with the LG’s smartphone getting a totally new concept of design, with the side buttons being pushed to the back panel, while Samsung retained the Galaxy’s standard design in the S4. These two would be well faded away when the Moto X comes into the market, for its design having more than 500 options to choose from, and the back panel is one of the main focus. </p>
<p> Processor, Internal Powering </p>
<p> Processor wise, it’s the G2 from LG that would take away all the appreciation with the 2.3 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, being way better than the Galaxy S4 which although has got 8 cores, the clocking speed is 1.9GHz on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor, while the one in the Moto X is a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro clocking at 1.7 GHz speed. </p>
<p> The RAM support for multitasking is the same with 2GB RAM available in all the three devices, while the GPU is a little advanced in the G2 with the Adreno 330 compared to the Adreno 320 in both the Galaxy S4 and the Moto X. </p>
<p> Rear and Front Camera </p>
<p> The results of captures cannot be compared right now, but given the specs there’s nothing much different except the inner features because the LG G2 and the Galaxy S4 have got a 13-megapixel camera on the rear side assisted with the flash, while the Motorola Moto X has got a 10.5MP Clear Pixel camera. </p>
<p> The camera in the Galaxy S4 has got its own dedicated features such as the Dual capture using both the cameras together, while to make the picture quality better, there is Optical Image Stabilization in the camera of the LG G2. Video capturing of 1080p Full HD quality is possible in all the three cameras, and the front cam is not much different in all the three – 2.1MP in the G2, while 2MP in both the other devices. </p>
<p> OS, Interface and Features </p>
<p> The latest Android OS version is Android 4.2.2, and thus all the three smartphones are coming with the Jelly Bean 4.2.2 version. The interface is quite different in all the three devices, with the Galaxy having the TouchWiz UI which is still the easiest to use, but when someone is looking for some good customization it’s LG G2 and Moto X which would give us something better. </p>
<p> Some special features which can be seen in the specific smartphones, include: </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S4: Air Gestures, Smart Pause, Smart Scroll, Group Play, WatchON </p>
<p> Motorola Moto X: Active Display, Quick Capture, Touchless Control, Design customization </p>
<p> Battery </p>
<p> One of the important factors to consider, the battery is the best in the G2, which could now easily beat the Galaxy S4 which was known to have the longest battery backup in the latest best Android smartphones. Going with the specs, the G2 is going to have a 3000 mAh battery, with the Korean version having a 2,610mAh capacity, while the battery in the Galaxy S4 is of 2600 mAh and in the Moto X, it is 2200 mAh. We aren’t sure whether one can remove the battery of the LG G2, but it can happen in the S4 but the Moto X is a unibody and thus the battery is non-removable. </p>
<p> Connectivity </p>
<p> Connectivity wise, there’s nothing much that would be different in the three smartphones, because the Galaxy S4, LG G2 and the Moto X have got the LTE apart from the CDMA, EV-DO, GSM, DC-HSPA+ connectivity options and there’s NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 technology and Wi-Fi 802.11 a/ac/b/g/n, dual-band. </p>
<p> Pricing </p>
<p> The pricing of the LG G2 is not yet confirmed, but the phone would be available through 4 carriers in the US, and globally through around 130 carries in the coming 8 weeks. But when you talk about the pricing of the Galaxy S4 and the Moto X, we already had said how bad the pricing of it is – Check Moto X Pricing issues. </p>
<p> Now, if LG decides to go bonkers and set a pricing of over $600 for its latest flagship device, it would be harder to select a smartphone to buy, but if the pricing is well in competition with that of the Galaxy S4, we would be seeing it as a better choice because of the given specs, and the screen isn’t that huge in the lines of the Galaxy Note, and the 5.2-inch screen won’t be at all larger compared to the 5-inch display of the Galaxy S4. </p>
<p> LG G2 vs Samsung Galaxy S4 vs Motorola Moto X Specs Comparison </p>
<p> Did you like the LG G2? If yes do let us know what you feel is the best feature that would make you feel the G2 is better than the S4, or the Moto X, or even the HTC One! </p>

<p> LG G2 Review – Best LG Smart Phone Ever with 13Mp OIS Camera & IPS Display </p>
<p> Are the users already bored or they feel weird while using the side buttons to unlock the screen and toggle the sound? LG feels so, and they claim it’s after a research and after feedback from people, they decided to remove all that from the sides and take it to the new place where it has never been on any device – the Back panel. The new LG G2, the flagship device from the company launched recently is in my hands as I share my thoughts about the device. There’s some good stuff, there’s quite some unneeded modifications which are just made to keep the device unique. Let’s see how good the G2 is. </p>
<p> Design, Form Factor and Exterior </p>
<p> Design wise, there’s a lot of changes but the issue is that there was no change needed. There are thousands of devices from the various manufacturers which have the buttons on the side and top, but LG decided to give the buttons an importance with the new position. Still, if you are one of those who has a finger placed on the back panel, these buttons could come handy for toggling the sound while making a call. </p>
<p> Apart from these changes, nothing much else is different except the very thin bezel which is something pretty cool because you get to have almost an edge to edge display diagonally on the sides, with the bezel being just 0.1mm thick. LG has done a good job by placing the flash beside the camera lens, because for those who are going to use the volume keys as the camera shutter button, will not be disturbing or covering the flash. </p>
<p> The rear buttons aren’t limited to the functions of what they are named for, because long pressing the volume down button would open the camera app, and the long press of volume up button opens the Quick memo app, which can be changed to anything else. </p>
<p> The gestures on the screen are excellent, and we would talk about it below. As of now, the colors and the output of graphics is excellent on the 5.2-inch 1080p display, which the company says, is the maximum screen size one can get for a 2.7-inch of width of the device. LG has brought in an option for the users to wake the screen when the phone is lying flat, and you don’t need to lift the phone to press the back button. It’s the Knock Knock gesture which would wake the screen when you do a couple of gentle taps on the screen. It works well, but not always. </p>
<p> The front has got the three touch based buttons on the bottom, where the Home, Back and Options are accessible. On the top of the screen is the few sensors along with the 2-megapixel camera. Overall, it’s a very neat design but you got to face it – The back button would take the load and not the camera lens, thus the scratching and fading away of the color of the button should happen after a few months of rough usage. </p>
<p> Processor, Internal Powering and Interface </p>
<p> The navigation of the intuitive interface is quick and very responsive, thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor which is again backed by 2GB of RAM for the multitasking support. One good thing is that although you might not like a few customized features and settings that LG has provided, it isn’t fixed up there and you can modify most of the stuff based on your need. When you sum up everything, the user experience is very good because LG has offered some great widgets, options and the notification panel itself depicts most of the Settings section with more than 15 toggles for the connectivity and other settings in the top. </p>
<p> Guest mode is something exceptional, which lets you maintain the privacy when you give the device in someone’s hand. The guest mode has a separate pattern lock and you can set the apps which they can check in that Guest mode. But it’s not perfect as one can still go to the Gallery through the Camera app if they wished to, and here the App Locker app would do an easier job. </p>
<p> The camera is exceptional, in terms of both picture capturing and video recording because there’s Optical Image Stabilization where the lens does most of the job in coming up with the stable final image. It does present some good details even in dark conditions, without the flash assistance. There are lots of effects and modes one can use while capturing the pictures, including the Normal, Shot & Clear, HDR, Panorama, VR panorama, Burst shot, Beauty shot, Dual camera and Time catch shot. You can check out a few shots below, while we did a full round of photo capturing in various conditions, and you can check out the quality based on these. </p>
<p> LG G2 Camera Capture Samples </p>
<p> The sound quality is good, but the output isn’t as much as that provided by the Galaxy Note 3 or the HTC One, if we are comparing the latest best devices. The 1080p video playback is flawless, and one can easily like it because the device is quite bright under direct sunlight. </p>
<p> The battery included in the device is 3000 mAh, which does provide a decent time of continuous usage but it gives up pretty fast when you do continuous video recording or Wi-Fi Tethering because that’s when the device gets heated up and the battery percentage decreases 2-3x faster than normal. </p>
<p> This week we did a hangout using the LG G2 and you can watch the same below. </p>
<p> Final Verdict </p>
<p> Firstly, the pros – The display is brilliant, and the camera for us, is even better than the Xperia Z1’s and Galaxy Note 3’s cameras in many instances, mainly because of the Optical Image Stabilization. The interface is impressive too, with the several options for people to play around with, and the device is very much comfortable to hold. </p>
<p> Now, the cons – The most important part – Back buttons. They are good in some way, but bad in many ways. For an instance, I browse through the various videos and news on my feed every morning and during lunch, and that’s when the volume needs to be adjusted while the device is lying on the table. I now have to lift the device and toggle the volume, or go to the home screen to lock the screen by double tapping it. That’s not easy to do always. The G2 heats up quite fast on some heavy usage and thus the battery too drains very quickly. Another point that worries us, is the fixed storage with no option to expand. We had said about the same about the LG Nexus 4 too, remember? The storage expansion should have been possible. </p>
<p> Overall, the LG G2 is priced quite well especially to compare with the other flagship devices which are launched at the same time – Sony Xperia Z1, Samsung Galaxy Note 3! And the device is well worth it, if you are ready to adjust to the new button placement to lock your screen, which you do tens of times every day, and if at all you are happy with a device which would not allow more storage (although there are many ways, like the cloud storage to get things adjusted). </p>

<p> 20+ LG G2 Tips & Tricks – Hidden Options, Useful Features </p>
<p> The LG G2 is one of the best Android smartphones of the year 2013, and why not, it does have a lot of potential against the other smartphones in the current Android smartphone market, but are you making the most out of it, or just using it as any other device? Here are a few tips and tricks of LG G2 using which you can enhance the user experience and make it a more personalized device for your usage. </p>
<p> LG G2 Tips and Tricks </p>
<p> Change App Icon – Size or Picture </p>
<p> There are a few features which are limited to just the LG devices. This is one of them, where you can change the icon for the app, and changing here means – changing the size, the actual icon picture by selecting from the given icons or selecting one from your own gallery. </p>
<p> On the home screen, tap and hold on the app icon and then let go. It would show a bluish option on the top right of the icon which would stay for a couple of seconds. Press on that to see the options opened for the particular icon. </p>
<p> You’ll see the option to expand the icon, or change it as given in the screenshots below. </p>
<p> Knock On – Tap the screen to wake it up </p>
<p> This is again one of the best ways LG has given for those who didn’t like the back button placement, especially when the phone is placed on a table and they have to lift the phone to press the power button. Just tap the screen twice gently so that the screen wakes up and you can then unlock it. That isn’t limited to unlocking, because you can use the same tips to lock the screen by tapping twice on any empty area or the notification bar on the top. </p>
<p> To change the settings, you can go to Settings > General > Gestures > Knockon and toggle it on / off. </p>
<p> Change chat bubbles / theme in Messaging </p>
<p> The messaging app in most of the Android smartphones is the standard one, with the regular chat bubbles, but in LG G2, you can personalize it and use one of the several themes and bubbles that are given by LG, or you can go to an extent where the theme can be uploaded by you and changed. </p>
<p> Go to Messaging app > Menu > Settings > Conversation theme and here, you will see the option to change both “Wallpaper” and “Bubble” where the background as well as the chat bubbles are changed into different ones based on your preference. The wallpaper can be something that is captured using your camera, or you can choose one from the Gallery. </p>
<p> QSlide – Using the apps in small windows </p>
<p> The QSlide is a feature where you would be able to open multiple apps on the same screen, in small windows and this is the best for multitasking, although the actual multitasking is different from this. The QSlide is seen as the second option when you drag down the notification panel. Selecting that would open a list of QSlide apps just below the settings in the panel, and you can open any of the apps from there. </p>
<p> Changing the apps and order of them is possible by going to the Edit option in the end of the QSlide. Also, you can change the transparency of the app window with the slider given on each app when you open it. This would help in doing stuff when you have to check what’s on the background. </p>
<p> Slide Aside – Multitask Always </p>
<p> This is not the multitasking that you see as the default one in the Android phones, because in the Slide Aside, you can store up to three apps for an unlimited time, unlike the standard multitasking where you see the apps disappear when the latest ones replace them. </p>
<p> In Slide Aside, you need to swipe three fingers to the left when on an app page, so that the particular app page gets saved. You can do that with three apps, and the preview looks excellent, showing you the three saved apps one of which you can open any time. You may press the X button to remove the app if you wanted to have any other app in the Slide Aside multitasking. </p>
<p> Guest Mode in LG G2 </p>
<p> There’s a very good Guest Mode feature which would limit the usage and the apps when you are giving the phone to someone who you feel, should not be able to check your personal details, messages, call logs etc. The Guest Mode would allow you to set the apps which you prefer to show to the guest, and for that you will have to first set the pattern lock. Go to Settings > Display > Lock screen and pick the pattern unlock and set that one for yourself. </p>
<p> Now, head to Settings > General > Guest Mode and you will be able to set a pattern for the guest mode, and select the apps which to show in the guest mode. It would have a very limited usage, because the person won’t be able to open even the notification panel, and only the apps which you allowed would be shown on the screen. </p>
<p> Use LG G2 as Remote Control </p>
<p> The G2 can act as a universal remote control, and it isn’t limited to just the TVs but you can use your smartphone for various stuff which includes – Set-top box, Audio player, DVD player, Blu-ray disc player, Air conditioner, Projector and the smartphone can act as a Universal remote. </p>
<p> Just click on the Plus icon on the right top and it would take you to the options to select from, i.e. the type of remote. For example, if you add Set-top box, it would take you to the brands of the STB or the brand which is providing you the DTH connection. There would be a series of tests to be done, and only if is working correctly, you can proceed and it would get saved under the various places such as office, bedroom, living room etc. so that you can use it easily later on. </p>
<p> You can choose to Auto display the QuickRemote at home, as soon as it locates that you have reached home, and you can toggle between the sound and vibrate settings when you press any remote button. </p>
<p> Quick ways to capture Screenshot </p>
<p> Although the different button placement, the LG G2 would allow you to capture the screenshots in different ways, and that won’t take any extra time, because you are seeing the keys closer to easily press them. One of the ways is to just press the Power and Volume down button together, and it would do the needful. </p>
<p> The other way is to use the QuickMemo feature, which not just captures the screenshot but also gives you a quick way to edit and add any text to the screenshot if you wanted to do so. There are two ways to open the QuickMemo: 1. From the notification panel – the first option there is the quickmemo, which has to be opened from the actual screen where you wanted to capture the screen 2. From the home button – Pull the home button upwards from the bottom to quickly open three options, the right one in them being the one for quickmemo, which does the same job. </p>
<p> Capture Full frame pictures with camera </p>
<p> If you are one of those who would capture the photos mainly to view from the smartphone screen itself, then you should have the wide view captures rather than the 4:3 aspect ratio ones which give a black bar on the either side of the image, because of the fixed ratio. The default one set is 13-megapixel which comes in the 16:9 ratio and thus you see the black bars on the left and right when seen in the landscape mode, and the option you need to select here is the 10-megapixel one which gives the aspect ratio that fills the entire screen. </p>
<p> Swipe to Delete / Share Photos </p>
<p> The Gallery app in the LG G2 although has the standard options to share or deleting the photos, does an even better job for those who wanted to check each photo individually and then decide what to do with it. When swiping between the different photos, you just need to pinch the photo a little to show the options such as swipe up to delete and swipe down to share. Based on what you want to do, swipe it. </p>
<p> Quick Actions with Back Buttons </p>
<p> The back buttons aren’t just for a single purpose, i.e. you can surely increase or decrease the volume of the smartphone with the Up and Down keys on the back panel of the G2, but a bit more can be done along with it. When the screen is turned off, if you press the Volume up button for a couple seconds, it would activate the Quickmemo if you wanted to jot down any notes. Similarly, if the Volume down button is pressed for a couple seconds, it would activate the camera without you having to activate the screen. </p>
<p> Change Front Bottom Touch Buttons </p>
<p> The touch buttons in the front bottom are not the capacitive fixed ones, because these are the system buttons which can be manipulated and changed, from the options given in the settings. Go to Settings > Display > Front touch buttons and see the different options available for the front buttons. There are bars which include even the Notification panel button and the quickmemo app. </p>
<p> Smart Screen – Keeps screen active if you are facing it </p>
<p> The smart screen feature is something similar to what you might have seen in the Galaxy S4 from Samsung. The thing that is done in this, is that the front camera of the LG G2 would check whether you are looking at the screen, and if yes, it would not allow the screen to turn off automatically on the normal screen timeout time that you have set. To activate that, you need to go to Settings > Display > Smart On > Smart screen. </p>
<p> Plug & Play options for Earphone </p>
<p> Whenever you plug a 3.5mm pin in the headphone jack, normally the phones don’t respond to it although the headphone works. In the LG G2, you can select a set of apps whose icons would show up for you to easily access them, and most of the times it would be one of those apps which you would have opened normally when you use the headphones. To set up the list of apps which are to be shown, go to Settings > General > Accessory > Earphone. </p>
<p> Dual Camera – Showing yourself while capturing others </p>
<p> Again one of the features which is nothing new in the high-end smartphones, but a very useful one when you are missing yourself while capturing your family in a photo. The Dual camera mode shows a small box with the front camera while most of the screen in the camera app is still filled by the objects from the back camera. With the Dual camera, you can: </p>
<p> Drag to move the small screen </p>
<p> Touch and hold to resize the small screen </p>
<p> Tap small screen to swap the screen </p>
<p> Swiping from bottom in the camera with dual camera mode would show the various shapes for the small screen – Window, Stamp, Oval blur, Instant, Heart shape, Star shape, Fish eye, Split view. </p>
<p> Capture Plus – How to capture screenshot of full web page </p>
<p> Capturing screenshot, as we said above, has a few different ways but that would be only for the current screen and nothing that can be scrolled down or up. While browsing through the web browser in the LG G2, you would find a feature called Capture Plus, in the menu. That is what would capture the entire page from top to bottom, and save that to the gallery. </p>
<p> Setting up a Default home screen </p>
<p> There are multiple home screens in the interface, which has been a case with most of the Android smartphones, but when you have to make it look neat and organized, don’t keep shifting between the home screens by yourself, as you can take advantage of the default home screen option. Set one of the home screens as default by pinching on the home screen and then selecting the option “Set default Home screen”, and then tap the home screen which you wanted to set as the default one. </p>
<p> Quick Check and Uninstall Apps </p>
<p> Just like in the iOS devices, you can uninstall the apps directly by just a couple touches from the app pages. On the app drawer page, you just need to touch the Wrench icon on the top right, which would show the X option beside every app which you can uninstall. Clicking on the one which you want to uninstall, the information about the app is shown, and the option to uninstall it. And the deletion of the app is pretty quick, with a trash sound confirming that the app is gone. </p>
<p> Set up Battery Saver Mode on Low Battery </p>
<p> The battery saving mode is again one of the standard options provided in most of the smartphones, as the brands know how fast the battery gets drained when you are using it at ease. At a certain battery percentage, the battery saver mode, when activated, would automate a lot of stuff and keep your phone on mainly for calling and messaging, as most of the other stuff is hibernated. To activate the battery saver mode, you need to go to Settings > General > Battery > Battery Saver. </p>
<p> Change the Font and Size of Text </p>
<p> Personalization getting even better. Above we did share how you can change the messaging apps’ background and chat bubbles, and now here’s how you can change the text font and the size to a few limited options, but they would do quite a good job. Go to Settings > Display > Font where you would see the options for changing both – font type and size. </p>
<p> There is quite a lot more you can do with the LG G2, and we would be sharing more of such tips and tricks for this smartphone very soon. Keep subscribed, and do check out the tips section for such guides for the other Android smartphones as well. </p>

<p> LG G3 Hands-on – The First Look & Initial Impressions on the LG’s 2014 Flagship </p>
<p> LG G3, the current flagship device from LG for this year is easily one of the best smartphones that we have in the current market. The LG G3 was announced last month and was made available earlier in this month, but not in every market. The variant we have with us, is the Korean variant. This beast boasts a Quad HD display on its 5.5 inch screen that in turn givens a whooping pixel density of 538 ppi. The screen of this device is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass version 3 and has a metallic look on its back that look so elegant in the hand but the metallic look doesn’t make it any heavier as it is just 149 grams. </p>
<p> Well LG has been following its trend of mounting its buttons at the back instead of the traditional side buttons and it is the same in the case of this flagship device also. Many had issues with these rear mounted buttons that protruded out and was making it difficult to carry this device in pocket as they were picky and uneven when placed on the desk, so LG has noted this point hand pushed these rear buttons a tad inside making it more comfortable. </p>
<p> Talking about the design of the device, it looks very premium with its metallic finish and also has very thin bezels. There are on-screen buttons and nothing to the side. At the back there is a 13 MP sensor and dual LED flash. At the back, we can find the speaker at the bottom and LG’s branding apart from the LTE logo at the center. </p>
<p> Going with the spec, The LG G3 is powered by a Snapdragon 801 quad core processor coupled with 3 GB of RAM and Adreno 330 GPU. The back cover of the device can be removed and so does the battery that is at 3000 mAh. The most important prospect is the 4K display we see, but we couldn’t find much difference until you have something such high resolution. Moreover we also spotted that there is a huge change in the interface of the device that is beautiful enough but will make it little harder for the initial use if you have used its predecessor, LG G2. The UI is made simpler and easier and you can also see many differences starting with the Knock code feature. </p>
<p> Another big thing that we noticed in the device is in its 13 MP camera that came with the Laser Autofocus feature. Using the this feature was real fun as we found that the shutter speed was really fast and the response time was very minute giving perfect pictures of even the moving objects. We will be coming forward with complete review of this camera that will be very interesting. </p>
<p> This is the First look of the LG G3 and we would be coming with the complete review of this flagship device after using it for few more days. So what do you feel about this device? Drop your comments and queries below. </p>

<p> LG G3 Vs LG G2 Comparison – Is the LG G3 Worth an Upgrade from G2? </p>
<p> LG has launched the LG G3, this year’s flagship with some brilliant specifications. We know that the LG G2 was one of the best devices last year, and thus the question for this year would be – will LG G3 come up to the expectation? Is it a worthy upgrade over its predecessor? Let us compare these two devices and see what all new features that this device has come up with and see what this phone will offer us that claim to be one of the biggest smart phones this year. </p>
<p> Design and Dimensions </p>
<p> The design of these devices have are almost the same, with the rear mounted volume rocker buttons but the G3 has its buttons pushed a bit inside so that it won’t have bulky feel. The thickness of both the devices same at 8.9 mm and the LG G 3 weights litter heavier (6 grams) than the 143 grams LG G2. LG used the same True HD-IPS + LCD capacitive touchscreen on both the devices. In terms of the form factor LG has retained the same design and look on G3 as it was on the LG G2. </p>
<p> Display </p>
<p> The LG G3 has a bigger display of 5.5 inch that is 0.3 inch bigger than its predecessor. The main thing that is to notice here is the resolution of the LG G3 that flaunts a 2K display (2560 x 1440) giving a pixel density of 534 ppi that is way better than the 423 ppi that we have seen on the LG G2. </p>
<p> The G2 has the Corning Gorilla Glass 2 protection, whereas the LG G3 gets the protection of the latest Gorilla Glass 3 that gives better protection from scratches. </p>
<p> Internal Specifications </p>
<p> The LG G2 is powered by a Quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor clocking at 2.26 GHz, coupled with Adreno 300 GPU and 2 GB of RAM. The flagship model will be having the same Quad core processor with a better Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset, with litter faster clocking speeds at 2.5 GHz. Moreover the G3 is available in 2 GB as well as 3 GB RAM models depending on the market. The LG G3 will come out of the box with Android 4.4.2 KitKat and G2 has received the update of the same. </p>
<p> Camera / Storage </p>
<p> The company has used the same 13 MP rear camera on both the devices but the G3 get a laser autofocus that will allow the device to focus instantly. The front facing camera is also same at 2.1 MP and the main part here is that LG G3 is capable of 4K video recording and it also has dual LED. </p>
<p> The LG G 2 was available in 16 GB and 32 GB variants and didn’t feature a microSD card slot to extend the memory, but it’s the case with the LG G3, it has a microSD card to extend the memory up to 128 GB and will be available in 16 GB and 32 GB variants. </p>
<p> Connectivity/ Battery </p>
<p> Both the devices have the same set of connectivity’s and will be powered by the same 3000 mAh battery. The battery in the G2 cannot be removed but this time with G3 you have the luxury of removing the battery and change it, just in case if you want. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Well from the specifications we have seen, we can say that the G3 is definitely an improvement over the G2 in terms of the display size and resolutions that will be giving better viewing angles on a bigger display and also is powered with a better chipset. In the camera segments, there are small tweaks and even the battery is removable in the case of the flagship model. </p>
<p> The LG G3 is definitely an upgrade over the G2 but what about the pricing, we have not yet received any news about the pricing of the G3 and unless we get the pricing we cannot suggest anything. If pricing doesn’t matter, then you can definitely go for the flagship model. </p>

<p> LG G3 Pricing Round Up (World Wide Pricing Details) </p>
<p> While LG gave no word about the pricing of the LG G3 during the announcement of the flagship device, several places around the world have already got the shipments and are ready for sale for the dates set, thus the pricing is already known for some of the major markets. The LG G3 was announced with the 5.5-inch Quad HD display, two variants with 16GB and 32GB internal storage and RAM depending on the storage, and some excellent internal specs. </p>
<p> In simultaneous events held in New York, London, and San Francisco, the LG G3 was made official and the first market where the phone would be sold, is South Korea. The pricing set by LG for the 32GB variant of LG G3 in South Korea is KRW 899,800 (which makes it to around USD 880, INR 52000). That comes as a good news for the Korean customers as they were expecting the device to be available for the price of over KRW 900,000 given the specifications and comparing it with the competitors. </p>
<p> While the pricing in the Korean market was quite high, the Australian website of LG shows the price of AUD 799 for the 16GB variant, although the phone is not yet released. In Singapore, the phone has got the pricing of SGD 868 for the 16GB variant, while the 32GB variant would cost SGD 928. Thus so far, the price of the device is the least in Singapore. </p>
<p> In the European market, only the pricing in Finland is known – EUR 599 for 16GB, EUR 649 for 32GB variant. The availability in Europe is said to be during early June, while we are yet to know about the availability in the US and in the other Asian countries, especially India. </p>
<p> There are a few online stores which have set the pricing already with no expected date for availability, and these include Amazon Germany which lists the G3 16GB model for EUR 549, while Belsimpel, the dutch retailer has listed the device for the same price for the 16GB model and EUR 599 for the 32GB model. There is no information whether all the color options will carry the same price tag, and if not, the users will have an option to choose from the five color options – Metallic Black, Silk White, Shine Gold, Moon Violet and Burgundy Red. </p>
<p> The LG G3 has a 5.5-inch 2K Quad HD display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor clocking at 2.5 GHz, 3000 mAh battery, 13-megapixel rear camera with the Dual-LED Dual tone flash, Laser Auto focus, 2.1-megapixel front facing camera, Android 4.4.2 KitKat and the two models – 16GB with 2GB RAM, 32GB with 3GB RAM. </p>

<p> LG G3 Screenshots Leaked – New UI, Quad HD Display – Leaks & Details </p>
<p> LG G3 leaks out with the new UI and is expected to be announced in the coming months that will be the flagship Smart phone for LG this year. This LG G3 will be the successor to the LG GE that was launched last year. We have already seen some of the company’s releasing their flagship models like the Galaxy S5 from Samsung and the HTC One (M8) but these devices featured just a 1080p display. With LG G3 we can expect a Quad HD (1440 x 2560 pixels) display and the new screenshots of the UI (User Interface) are confirming this ultra-high resolution on G3. </p>
<p> The Screenshots leaks shows a clean and simple UI and it resembles the LG isai FL that was revealed recently so we can expect very thin bezels and this flagship model should be running on the latest Android 4.4 KitKat and powered by a Snapdragon 801 processor coupled with an 3 GB RAM and also expected to feature a 13 MP camera or an 16 MP camera on the rear. </p>
<p> Image Source : Digital Trends </p>
<p> In the UI we can see the shortcuts to activate NFC, Bluetooth, WI-Fi, and the 3G or 4G data connection along with a Q Remote button. We have seen LG has used Q Remote on various devices that include the successor of LG G3, and it uses an infrared blaster to control all other applications around the house. The big buttons on the notification panel has been replaced by smaller icons and Google is trying to make a flatter look for the Android icons also as what we see in the UI that got leaked. </p>
<p> All these specifications already makes this LG G3 smart phone a high end flagship model and we are yet to see more specifications of the device coming out and even the design of the device is another point to be noted. You can expect many more leaks of this smart phone in the coming days and hope that LG announces this device soon. </p>

<p> LG G3 with 5.5″ Screen & 2.5 GHz Quad-Core Processor for Rs. 47,990 – Specs, Features & Pre Order Details </p>
<p> LG has launched the new flagship smartphone in India, with two variants of the LG G3 – 16GB one priced at Rs. 47,990 and the 32GB one for Rs. 50,990. The company also officially launched the LG G Watch at the event, which was already put up for pre-order and LG delayed the shipments, probably to launch it alongside the G3. LG announced Rs. 15,000 worth of offers for LG G3 buyers, with a QuickCircle case (Rs. 3,500) bundled for free, along with a Rs. 5,000 discount on the G Watch, and a one-time screen replacement worth Rs. 6,500. </p>
<p> Earlier: LG announced the LG G3 with some of the best specs and most of the stuff that was already known to most of the world after those several leaks. After LG had come up with the new design having the keys on the back in the LG G2, the company retained the same button position in the LG G Pro 2, and now the G3 too maintains the same external look. There is a new metal look on the back, which is not just lightweight but also fingerprint-proof (due to the polycarbonate material) and looks brilliant with the color options too. </p>
<p> What is more important to look here, is the display and the internal configuration of the LG G3. The new flagship from LG comes with 5.5-inch Quad HD display with 538ppi with four times the resolution of HD and almost two times higher resolution than a Full HD display. The powering is by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset, clocking at up to 2.5 GHz, and there is a support by 2GB / 3GB RAM based on the storage – 16GB and 32GB variants, with the storage expansion possible to 128GB with the MicroSD card. </p>
<p> Design: The front of the phone has a very narrow bezel, and the area given for the screen is large. The back is metallic with the brushed metal look, and the back keys are all flat. Just like the HTC One M8, the LG G3 has a curved design on the back. The flattening of the back keys is what makes it better than the G2 because those buttons were what making the keys prone to scratching. </p>
<p> Display: The display of the LG G3 is of 5.5-inch in size, with the resolution being a Quad HD one, four times an HD display and thus the resolution – 2560 x 1440 pixels, taking the pixel density to 538 PPI. It’s an IPS display, similar to what LG used in the G2 which had a Full HD display. </p>
<p> Camera: LG made the camera a lot better with a new addition – Laser autofocus! That’s something new and innovative. Apart from that, the 13-megapixel shooter of the LG G3 will come with the Advanced OIS+ and there is a Dual LED flash. </p>
<p> LG G3 Pricing & Availability LG G3 will be available in India with a price tag of Rs. 46,990 and will be available for purchase after 25th July, 2014. We came across the listing on infibeam page. </p>
<p> Earlier: The LG G3 is the upcoming flagship Smartphone from LG that everyone is waiting for. This device is confirmed to be announced on 27th May and just a week earlier the official webpage of the LG G3 has been spotted at the company’s UK’s official website. On this page the Smartphone has been identified and it comes with a model number LG D855 and it is the same model number that was spotted late last month. </p>
<p> The UA (User Agent) profile of this D855 claimed that the device will feature a 1080 x 1920 pixel display but now it has been updated to 1440 x 2560 pixels, confirming that this device will be the first Smartphone from the company to feature a Quad HD display. It is also expected that the device will sport a 5.5 inch display but the company has now confirmed any details till now. Well we will know all the details within a week’s time when the device will be announced. </p>
<p> Earlier – LG G3 with Brushed Metal Back teased in Official Video – Leaked Specs & Details – May 13th, 2014 </p>
<p> The LG G3 is just a couple of weeks from here, and we get to finally see something official from the company, apart from the invite that was sent earlier. The official teaser video from LG gives us an idea of what is coming out to compete against the giants – Samsung Galaxy S5 and the HTC One M8. Brushed metal back, the flat rear keys and the OIS camera is shown clearly, while we can still wait to see what else LG has put in. </p>
<p> Let us see if LG has plans to flaunt it ahead of the official announcement. </p>
<p> Earlier: The LG G3 has come in to the news once again before the scheduled launch (May 27th). This time the prolific leaker @evleaks has posted two images of this Smartphone in Black and White colour variants and has the narrow bezel design as it was shown in the earlier leaks. It has the rear mounted buttons with sensor next to the camera and also a loud speaker. </p>
<p> The leaks also show an Infrared LED on the top of the Smartphone and beside it we can see a slot that could be a stylus or even an antenna. LG G 3 is the company’s latest flagship device and will be coming with many new and powerful features. It is also expected to have the finger print scanner on its back but we have to wait and see what this device packs until it is officially unveiled by the company. </p>
<p> Earlier – LG G3 5.5″ Quad HD Display Expected with Back Mounted Keys & Octa-core Chipset – April 28th, 2014 </p>
<p> LG G3 which is the current hot topic in the Smart phone segment has leaked with its back, courtesy of GSMArena, we got the leaked image of the upcoming flagship smart phone from LG. This image is not that clear but we can observe a lot from it. This leaked image shows that the device will feature back mounted keys as we saw in the G2 line up devices but these keys have been re-designed from its predecessors. </p>
<p> The image also reveals that there is some sensor beside the camera which could be a second LED flash or it might be a finger print sensor, well we need to wait and see what sensor it is. The notes behind the pictures mention OIS+ and also 16 GB and 32 GB storage versions. Further we can also see that 2 GB / 3 GB is also been mention in the notes, that could possibly be that the device might be coming in two different variants. </p>
<p> Earlier – LG G3 to have 5.5-inch Quad HD Display, Advanced Personalization Options – Leaks & Rumors – March 20th, 2014 </p>
<p> Earlier, it was some rumors about the 2K resolution in the next flagship device from LG, but now we have some confirmed details from the sources that the LG G3 is going to have a 5.5-inch Quad HD resolution display. To add to this, the device would be coming with some advanced personalization options for the users. Now with this resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels, the pixel density hits a new high – 534 PPI. LG had showcased a new display last year, with the pixel density of 538 PPI, so there’s a possibility it is the same display which is company is now using in the G3. </p>
<p> LG won’t be the first brand to use a Quad HD display, because the Oppo Find 7 which was announced yesterday, has the same screen size and resolution. With regards to the personalization, it would be something related to Google Now and the personal assistance, but there is no word on whether it is Google Now or some custom LG software which we might be seeing. The device is expected to be made official around the end of second quarter of 2014, so we will have to wait to find more details. </p>

<p> Earlier: LG G3 Rumored Specifications – Octa-core Chipset, 2k Display and 16MP Camera The LG fans surely have some good rumors to rejoice about, as a few details about the next flagship G series Android smartphone are spread around, and the LG G3 is expected to come with a display having the 2K resolution, and along with that, there would be an octa-core chipset powering the smartphone. How good would that be? we already know how good the LG G2 is, with the unique (but really not a necessary change) design and the internal powering which provides a good performance. </p>
<p> Also known as the Quad HD, the display would be of the screen resolution 2560 x 1440 pixels, and that is not a part of more than a couple devices till now, and it hasn’t gone out of the Chinese market yet, thus LG coming up with that would be a direct competition against the Samsung Galaxy S5, which too is expected to come with a similar display, although the technology used by LG was an IPS one, while Samsung uses the Super AMOLED one. </p>
<p> The LG G2 was one of the best Android smartphones for the year 2013. How good would the G3 be? </p>
<p> With the G2 not receiving the appreciation the company expected, especially because of the awkwardly placed buttons, LG isn’t turning back because the G2 promised a good future for the Android lineup from the company, and the reason for that being the excellent Snapdragon 800 processor, and the 13-megapixel camera with the Optical Image Stabilization. What LG is trying to include in the G3, except for the display, is something which Gionee is already boasting about, in their latest flagship device – the Gionee Elife E7. But Gionee might not already see the similar craze because of the limited number of places where it is making the devices available. </p>
<p> Just like LG launched the G2 in the second half of 2013 (September 2013), they could be launching the successor to it in the second half of 2014. Let us see how good LG would be this time, after getting not-so-good market share this year with the disappointing numbers of LG G2 sales. To sum it up for now, here are the rumored specs: </p>

<p> Finally LG3 has launched in India with some very good offers and at an accessible price tag, i really love that quickcircle case </p>
<p> Its got an awesome Quad HD display along with 13MP OIS+ camera. A great update compared to the LG G2. </p>
<p> And features like Smart Notice, Smart Keyboard and Built-in Wireless Qi Charging makes the deal more sweeter. </p>
<p> Having a 538ppi screen is just mind blowing to me. Its something you would thought LG would offer. But since brands like Gionee and Oppo are offering it, how could the major players stay behind. </p>
<p> Anyways great article Chetan. Appreciate the efforts! </p>
<p> It can have all the whistles and bells under the sun but if it is not at least IP67 certified then IMO LG has blown it. </p>
<p> I agree with Jerry, the back buttons sit perfectly for finger placement, wether your holding the phone in landscape or vertical, your index finger tends to sit right where the buttons are located. When you are holding a large phone with one hand the side buttons can be a little awkward to get to, as you tend to hold the phone more towards the bottom. Also the amount of times I have hit the volume or power button when I am holding my phone in landscape(on side buttons), while watching video or playing games,is uncountable. I for one believe the feedback numbers, as I would certainly have voted for the button change if asked. </p>
<p> I have the LG G2 and am looking forward to the L3.And as for the back button,Its perfect.I had the much talked about HTC one and hated having to fumbled around for the top mounted power button.With the knock on/off feature,The power button is rarely used.And the volume is within reach weather you’re left or right handed. </p>
<p> The LG G2 BUTTONS ARE NOT AWKWARD! THE BUTTONS ON THE BACK ARE THE BEST THING TO COME ALONG SINCE SLICED BREAD! Good for left or right handed people! Side BUTTONS are awkward! </p>
<p> Only if there were some good cases accompanying the phone, or you would see the buttons to be the first ones to be prone to scratches and rubbing off. There are reasons why I say it’s awkward. Also, LG said it took feedback from millions before making this change in the button placement. How true is that? </p>

<p> Battle of Flagships – LG G3 Vs Xperia Z2 Vs Galaxy S5 Vs HTC One M8 Comparison </p>
<p> Finally the LG G3 is here after 9 months from its predecessor LG G2 that was a very good device considering its specs and features. This flagship device from LG might have come on to the scene late, but it will be flaunting a Quad-HD (2560 x 1440 pixels) display and many new and high end features. We have seen the flagship devices of Samsung, Sony and HTC already and now it is time to compare all these flagship devices from big Smart phone makers and see which one stands out where. </p>
<p> Design and Dimensions </p>
<p> LG is well known for mounting its hardware buttons on the back of the device, it was see in the LG G2 and now it’s the same case with the LG G3. Many had problem with the buttons on the back as they were a bit bulky but the company has made the buttons in a hollow like structure, so that it does not give the bulky feel any more. Other than this change, nothing much is noticeable from its previous design and almost looks the same. </p>
<p> The LG G3 is 8.9 mm thick, which is thicker than the Galaxy S5 and Xperia Z2 Smartphones that are at 8.1mm and 8.2 mm respectively and it might be because of its bigger display and built, but the HTC One M8 is the thickest of the lot at 9.4 mm. These devices are also in the lighter side, as the G3 weights 149 grams, whereas the Xperia Z2, Galaxy S5 and One M8 are at 158, 145 and 160 grams respectively. There is not a big difference in the weight of these devices and should be easier to carry with you always. </p>
<p> Display </p>
<p> Coming to the display, the LG G3 has the biggest screen in the list at 5.5 inch and will be sporting the Quad HD (2560 x 1440) display that no other flagship device in the list has and it will also give a whooping pixel density of 534 ppi which way ahead of the 432 ppi that you see on Galaxy S5 and One M8. </p>
<p> The screen of the LG G3 is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3, as it in the case of the Galaxy S5 and HTC One M8 device. The Sony Xperia Z2 has the protection of a Shatter proof and scratch-resistant glass. </p>
<p> The LG G3 is the clear winner here because of its 2K display on the 5.5 inch display screen which will be giving better viewing angles and also gives you the liberty of playing games and viewing movies on bigger screen. </p>
<p> Internal Specifications </p>
<p> As expected the LG G3 is powered with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor as it is in the case of all the flagship devices in the list and these are coupled with the same Adreno 330 GPU but the clocking speed of the LG G3 is slightly higher than the Xperia Z2 and One M8 at 2.5 GHz, same speed seen on the Galaxy S5. </p>
<p> Coming to the RAM, the LG G2 has a 2 GB as well as a 3 GB variant which will depend on the memory variants. The 2 GB RAM is accompanied with the 16 GB model and the 3 GB RAM is for the 32 GB variant, it will depend on the user to choose which option they want. Other than this the Xperia Z2 also has a 3 GB of RAM and the other two, Galaxy S5 and One M8 will adjust with 2 GB of RAM. </p>
<p> All these flagship devices will be run the latest Android 4.4.2 KitKat Operating system with the respected company’s UI (User Interface) on top. With the Android 4.4.3 update around the corner, we can expect these devices to be updated with these as soon as it rolls out in to the market. All these devices have the similar internal powering so nothing much can be said about this. </p>
<p> Camera / Storage </p>
<p> The LG G3 will come with 13 MP sensor at the rear with OIS+ that is capable of taking 4K videos. The Xperia Z2 has a 20.7 MP OIS camera with the G sensor and the flagship device from Samsung has a 16 MP camera. The HTC One M8 has a 4.1 Ultrapixel primary rear camera with a secondary rear camera to take depth information about the images. All these devices are capable of shooting 4K videos, except for HTC One M8. </p>
<p> There is a 2.1 MP rear facing camera on the LG G3 and the Xperia Z2, Galaxy S5 and HTC One M8 has a 2.2 MP, 2.1 MP and 5 MP front facing camera respectively. By far the HTC M8 has the best front facing camera in the list. </p>
<p> Out of the four only the Xperia Z2 is available in 16 GB variant and the rest all are available in 16 and 32 GB models. The memory can also be extended up to 128 GB via microSD card in G3, Galaxy S5 and One M8 but the device from Sony supports memory up to 64 GB only. </p>
<p> HTC One M8 </p>
<p> Connectivity/ Battery </p>
<p> These handsets have the usual set of connectivity and are 3G variants, also supporting 4G. The battery on the LG G3 is at 3000 mAh and in Samsung S5 a 2800 mAh, this battery can be removed from both these devices. While the HTC One M8 has a 2600 mAh battery and the Xperia Z2 has a 3000 mAh one that are non-removable. </p>
<p> Pricing/Conclusion </p>
<p> Coming to the pricing of these devices, the LG G3 is priced at KRW650,000 ($635) in Korea and we are not sure of the pricing of it outside Korea. The Xperia Z2 is priced at around $650, the flagship of Samsung is around $579 and the HTC One M8 is again around $650. The pricing may vary in different countries depending up on the carriers and the versions. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S5 and Sony Xperia Z2 are IP67 and IP 58 certified respectively for that makes the Galaxy S5 dust and water resistant and the Xperia Z2 becomes dust proof and water resistant. These two devices can resist water up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. More over the Samsung Galaxy S5 also has the features like the Hate Rate Sensor and Fingerprint sensor that make it a unique device. </p>
<p> The HTC One M8 is known for its dual rear facing cameras so that you can capture depth details of the images you take. In spite the dual rear camera and all the powerful specification, HTC has not made much news in the smart phone market. For now we are not sure how the LG G3 feels or works in our hand, so until we use them we cannot conclude anything. We need to wait few more days to know all about this flagship device from LG. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> LG G4 Smartphone Review </p>
<p> LG is riding a high tide this year unlike any of its times, as the LG G4 has taken the tech community by storm. It has been the talk of the town for a couple of days now, as the device is getting official pricing and is set for launch in some countries. Company has announced the Indian pricing to be at INR 51K, which is very high even for such powerful specs, as the competition is priced around 40K. We have been using the device for the past month, let’s take a more detailed look at the LG G4. </p>
<p> Design & Display </p>
<p> The first thing that is noticeable about the G4 is its screen curves, even though, they are not crescent-shaped such as the LG G Flex 2 but are rather subtly designed. The design makes it for a perfect protection of the display when the device is faced down, meaning it would not be scratch prone. The company also claims that the new design makes its screen more shatter proof in case of drops than G3. </p>
<p> The super-slim bezels of the curved display make it more compelling and compact than most of the 5.5-inch size devices. Our review unit has a leather finish in brown while the plastic craft would be available. Though, it is for a fact that even genuine leather would degrade after the usage of months. So, it is up to the user, whether they want plastic back or would still go for the leather variant or not. We haven’t tested the plastic variant, so, cannot comment whether it would be smudgy or not. Whereas leather back feels pretty comfortable to hold and, of course, won’t take any fingerprints marks. </p>
<p> The company has tried to retain conveniently accessible volume rocker and power button in the rear of the device. The position is still ideal, as fingers naturally wrap around the back of your device, leaving your thumb to carry out the on-screen work. The best part about the design is that the company didn’t leave the microSD and removable battery out of the option, as most of the flagship models this year has. It means there are only two slots; USB port and audio jack that is present on the edges of the device. There is a virtually invisible IR blaster at the top of the phone that can be used as the remote controller. The lack of buttons makes its design very clean and overall an eye charming. </p>
<p> Now talking about the display, the G4 packs an upgraded QHD panel. Rather than sticking to the same technology, LG has thought about how to offer a better display efficiently. The screen resolution is same at 2560 x 1440, but it still impresses a lot. As the color quality, sunlight visibility, and various other factors have been tightened up by the company. This can be called as the second generation QHD panel, as it reflects quite the improvements. The viewing angles on the G4 are perfect, no matter where you turn the device, as it has a good amount of brightness levels. And with a 98% DCI color reproduction, you get an eye-soaring saturation at subtle colors. Overall, it’s a good improvement from the display on G3. </p>
<p> Hardware & Performance </p>
<p> It can be easily assumed that LG G4 specs would ensure that it runs smoothly even if it has to go through a fair amount of strain. Though, the Hexacore Snapdragon 808 chipset on G4, didn’t show any lag in performance, as its two Cortex A57 cores can clock speeds up to 2.5 GHz. The decision of not using Snapdragon 810 might have been a wise one, as company’s G Flex 2 powered by same chipset have received criticism over excessive heating and the battery drainage of the device. LG has remained quiet about the reason for not using the 810 on G4, but it looks like that is out of the question now. </p>
<p> Talking about the Gaming part, the device has performed a pretty smooth, although, we did experience the few lags in some games like Asphalt and Modern Combat 5, but only when the device was running multiple games and played at high-end quality. Or it may be the effect of QHD display, as most of the games are not compatible with 1440p resolutions. So, it’s unfair to judge the Adreno 418 GPU while it is possibly the issue of games not supporting the QHD display. </p>
<p> In our Antutu benchmarks tests, the 808 SoC scored around 45000, which is on par with most of the flagship devices while it lacks behind the Samsung Galaxy S6‘s performance stats. With a Hexacore processor coupled with 3GB RAM, the device is still a beast. </p>
<p> We did a comprehensive browsing test on the G4 and came up with pretty interesting facts. The response was quick while Zoom-in & zoom-out operations were quite easy. The Hexa-core chipset gives a delightful experience, and we hardly saw any lag even when opening more than ten tabs. So, you can browse the web without worrying about the responsiveness. </p>
<p> Software </p>
<p> The new UX on the G4 is somewhat similar to the G3’s version, though; it comes with the latest Android 5.1 Lollipop which is not yet rolled out to flagship devices from their brands. Sporting similar feels, but with improved animations of Material Design language, the UX 4.0 feels fresh yet familiar. The features like Smart Bulletin and Smart Notice are integrated in this version too, just like the UX 3.0 on the G3. </p>
<p> The Smart Bulletin dedicates an entire home screen page for displaying the widgets like music player, your calendar, LG Health fitness tracker, QRemote are some of the feature found in that Bulletin. While the Smart Notice a digital assistant, which would show the notification cards for upcoming events and weather info, and will also address any missed notifications and long-unused apps. </p>
<p> With a large display, the company was bound to provide a Dual Window feature on it, which can be accessed through Overview hotkey. This feature would allow your screen to be used by two apps at a time, meaning you can multitask on two apps simultaneously. Moreover, the Knock Code on LG is perfect security hiding in the plain sight. If you’re not familiar with KnockOn, let us remind you that this feature enables your device to wake up or unlock once you tap on the screen with certain gestures while the display is turned off. </p>
<p> Talking about more software features, the GlanceView would allow you to check time, date, and any missed notifications on the sleeping screen. All you have to do is swipe your finger downward from the top edge. Even though, it is a too much animations; it gives a refreshing look to the interface. Overall, the clean look and easy to understand the function of the Android skin are its USP. </p>
<p> Camera </p>
<p> The most talked about feature of LG’s new flagship is the 16 MP rear camera, which boasts an aperture of f/1.8, closely beating the f/1.9 aperture of Galaxy S6’s rear camera. A good jump from the 13 MP on G3 to the 16MP on G4, the new camera module captures some of the most stable shots we have seen on a smartphone camera. It is also thanks to the improved Optical Image Stabilization. </p>
<p> This is the biggest upgrade that the company has done on its flagship this year. Not that the camera on G3 was bad, but the new module is pretty much capable to take detailed shots in any situations, may it be natural light or in low light. In our opinion, the low light capturing capabilities of the G4 is even better than the S6’s rear camera. And with the addition of manual mode, controlling the settings yourself is amazing, you get to tweak the shutter speed, ISO, exposure, white balance, and manual focus. Moreover, LG camera app now allows you to shoot RAW images too. </p>
<p> The selfie lovers can also rejoice, as LG has included a massive 8MP camera module on the front of the device. It has an aperture of f/2.0, which is quite high for a selfie camera. Taking photos is difficult with the rear key as a shutter button, but you can rather go for a gesture interval shot that will take four selfies in a series. Select the best one and socialize. </p>
<p> Battery </p>
<p> Just like last year’s G3, the new upgrade of the LG has a removable battery, and some users might love it that company has stick to doing that. The 3000mAh battery is also the same that was present on the predecessor. With an enough juice to last for a day on a normal usage, you can get around 3 hours of screen on time, though, on our heavy usage we only got it 2 hours, which is quite less than one would expect. And with no quick charging feature present, we had to put it on charging for around 1 hour 30 minutes to get the full charge. </p>
<p> If you like to spend quite a time on your device watching videos, surfing the web, and making calls, by the late afternoon the battery would come down to 15%. Though, it would not beat the score of Galaxy S6 in the talk time, but it is still an upgrade from what G3 was able to offer. </p>
<p> Verdict </p>
<p> LG G4 is a good upgrade from its predecessor, as it improves upon various aspects, like the design, display, performance and an impressive camera. If your question is whether or not to upgrade from the G3, then, the answer is you should upgrade, as it offers more polished features. But if you’re actively looking for models from other big brands and are inclined towards better battery efficiency, then Samsung Galaxy S6 should be your choice. </p>
<p> The USP of the LG G4 is its camera offering, particularly the night-time slow shutter captures and the raw file option with one of the best QHD display. The choice is yours, get the device, according to your needs. </p>

<p> LG G5 Rumoured to Feature IRIS Recognition Technology </p>
<p> LG G5, which will be the next flagship from LG, is rumoured to include an IRIS recognition technology. The device isn’t expected to release anytime soon since the LG G4 was launched recently.

<p> At the MWC 2017, LG launched the flagship LG G6 smartphone without the Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 SoC.

On the launch day, the company announced the device to go on sale starting March 10th, but that is only limited to its home country, South Korea. While the reliable leakster, Evan Blass already mentioned the device to be available in the U.S starting from April 7th, now he even got the proof.

<p> LG G Flex via AT&T Detailed with Plans & Pricing – Available from Feb 7th </p>
<p> The LG G Flex global availability is picking up the pace, as one of the big carriers in the US, the AT&T network has announced the plans and pricing and the details about the availability of this G Flex smartphone for the US market. The curved phablet with the flexible display would be available from January 24th on both, the online AT&T store or in their offline stores. That is the date for pre-orders while the actual full retail sales would start from February 7th, 2014. </p>
<p> Earlier to this, the G Flex was already priced with the Sprint network, at $299.99 and that is the same pricing which AT&T has set for its customers, with the 2-year contract. With the contract, the subscriber can select one of the two installment plans – Next 18 plan – $26.74 per month Next 12 plan – $34.75 per month </p>
<p> “We’re proud to offer the LG G Flex, our first smartphone with a curved screen, in the U.S. and add the device to the nation’s most reliable 4G LTE network,” said Jeff Bradley, senior vice president – Devices, AT&T. “We offer smartphones and devices to fit every lifestyle.

<p> LG G Flex Getting Bumps on Frequent Flexing – LG Explains why it happens </p>
<p> The LG G Flex that was available via Sprint earlier is reportedly said to have facing hardware problems on the display. LG said that they have tested the G Flex many times with 88 pounds on the back panel any did not find any physical damage on it. </p>
<p> The LG G Flex Smart phone offers a 6 inch curved display and chassis that comes back to its curved position even if it is flattened by applying pressure. But reports came from the Korea times that the phone is getting bumps on the display as a result of regular flexing of the display. The company acknowledges it but did not seem to be concerned and just advised the users not to bend it frequently and add excessive force on the screen. </p>
<p> LG said- Please don’t try to use frequent, excessive force on the device or the screen. The reason we’ve made the G Flex screen elastic is to protect the device from damage from sudden impacts such as being sat on or laid down on. Because the G Flex components inside the glass cover, OLED display, battery are elastic, excessive or frequent force that flattens the device produce bumps. </p>
<p> LG also claimed that these bumps will not affect the performance of the device and they should be disappearing over time and can be taken care by slightly pressing on them. This news will be a bad one for the company as it is set to release its device in the US market later this month. But the company thinks this is a non-issue. </p>
<p> As per the US release the Smart phone is hitting Sprint and coming to the store at 7th of February and will hit the AT&T and T-Mobile carriers vary soon. We do not have any information on other carriers and its global launch. Now, everything that’s totally new in the world of tech does come with some issues, and it’s the same with the G Flex. We’re sure LG is going to come up with something better in the near future. </p>

<p> LG G Flex to Sell at Rs 69,999 in India – Watch Scratch Test & Hands-On Video </p>
<p> LG Electronics announced the launch of LG G Flex in India and will be available starting this February 2014 which comes with the World’s First curved display along with some of the best in class display technicalities. While this smartphone has already launched in Korea, it will soon be available in India. So, lets check out on what are the specs and features of this all new smartphone from LG Electronics which seems to be a very revolutionary. </p>
<p> As announced earlier back in December, LG G Flex has come to India and has been listed on the LG’s official website for Rs. 69,999. This curved Smart Phone was announced in October 2013 and promises to be one of the best in today’s market with its high end specifications and mainly due to its cured OLED display that makes the Smart phone curvier giving better view and handling. </p>
<p> More than this, the device can be made flat by applying pressure and can withstand 88 pounds on the back panel without causing any physical damage and the device will come back to its original position once the pressure is removed. There were reports from the Korea times that the LG G Flex was getting bumps on its display after regular flexing of the device to which LG advised not to add excess force on it and avoid bending it regularly. All other specifications and Hands-On Video of the device are given below. </p>
<p> Earlier – LG G Flex with 6-inch OLED Curved Display Announced – Watch Scratch Test & Hands-On Video – December 12,2013 </p>
<p> Here is the Video on the LG G Flex Hands-On with Scratch Test & Durability Test by @AdvicesMedia. Some Interesting features showcased in this Video which are similar to the ones found on the Samsung Galaxy Series. </p>
<p> Specs & Features: </p>
<p> From scratch resistant screen to self healing back cover to swinging Lock screen, this LG G Flex Android smartphone can also sustain 40Kgs of weight on the device which has been tested by LG for 100 times. We have also mentioned the details list of specs and features below; </p>
<p> 6″ Curved Plastic OLED Display, </p>
<p> Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 2.26GHz Quad Core processor, </p>
<p> LG G Flex will be available in India in February 2014. There is no word about the pricing of LG G Flex yet, but we will keep you posted once we get any updates on the same. </p>
<p> The flexible display smartphone from LG, the G Flex is officially going to be available in the Korean markets from November 12th, and the pricing of that is 999,900 won ($941) which is quite a lot but for the given specs and something new, it shouldn’t be called really high. After this, the G Flex might make an official entry into the French market very soon (next month probably) and it might be costing around 700 euros. </p>
<p> Earlier: LG has now officially announced the LG G2 Flex smartphone, with the OLED display finally coming into the scene, and it’s a 6-inch OLED display with the 720p HD resolution, and under the hood, there’s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor clocking at 2.26 GHz and the phone would be running the Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean operating system. </p>
<p> The G Flex from LG has got a 13-megapixel rear camera with the LED flash and there is a 2.1-megapixel camera on the front side. The curved plastic OLED display in this smartphone has the real RGB sub pixels for the better color output, and there is a concavity in the display from the top to bottom. The battery included in the G Flex has a capacity of 3500 mAh, and it’s made by LG Chem. </p>
<p> LG says that because the body is curved, the speaker on the back doesn’t touch the base of the table or floor and thus the sound from it comes more clearly. The back panel has got a self healing technology, where the scratches can be removed in a few minutes. The power and volume buttons are placed on the back and there are quite a lot of features which are similar to that in the LG G2. Some of the software inclusions are as follows: </p>
<p> Face Detection Indicator </p>
<p> LG Knock-On Guest Mode </p>
<p> Q Theater to launch gallery </p>
<p> There is no word on the pricing and availability, but LG said that the G Flex would be coming in Titan Silver color from next month in Korea. </p>
<p> LG G Flex Specifications </p>
<p> 1280 x 720 pixels screen resolution </p>
<p> Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean OS </p>
<p> 32GB internal storage, expandable via MicroSD card </p>
<p> 13-megapixel rear camera with LED flash, 1080p video recording </p>
<p> 2.1-megapixel front facing camera </p>
<p> 4G LTE / 3G HSPA, WiFi 802.11 ac/a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP, GPS / aGPS, NFC </p>
<p> Battery: 3500 mAh </p>
<p> Earlier: The curved display Android smartphone that was recently announced was the Galaxy Round from Samsung, while the South Korean competitor LG too is working on the curved display, named the LG G Flex which was leaked in the press renders and that is what shows how the G Flex would look like. Just like what we saw in the Galaxy Round, the G Flex curves in a concave way, but this is horizontally curved. </p>
<p> The G Flex from LG is expected to come with the curved AMOLED display and not a glass curving. And this is what one would be expecting when we talk of curved displays – the top to bottom curve, which makes the curve look appropriate. Apart from that, what are learning from the rumors is that this would be a 6-inch curved display, unlike the 5.7-inch one in the Galaxy Round. </p>
<p> This is not the actual photo of the device, but just the press renders of how the device might look like, when out officially. If at all this is how the display would look like, we are going to see something that can easily look a lot better than the Galaxy Round. The G Flex is expected to be announced officially by November, and only then we will be able to learn more about it. </p>
<p> Talking about the actual functionality with the Curved display phones, the Galaxy Round would get my vote over the LG G Flex display for now, because it won’t be easy to fit in this kind of curve in the pockets, or to place it on a flat table. The wiggling of the device won’t be that much in the left-to-right curved device, than it would be in the top-to-bottom curve. But these are all our claims and expectations, we will get to know what LG has in the pack, very soon. </p>

<p> If you have forgotten our last post about the LG G Flex, let me remind you that it is slightly bendable, curved phone (not flexible!) with a 6 inch display and 720p display with LG’s Real Stripe technology inside. The LG G Flex is running on the fastest processor available for mobile phones (2.3 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core) with 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage and has a 13 MP shooter at the rear giving quality images. The LG G Flex was announced in October last year and was world first curved Smart phone. </p>
<p> More over the device has a plastic OLED display with a curved battery and has a self healing back. That heals itself from scratches, so users need not worry about the scratches also. The device is expected to arrive at T-mobiles and AT&T in the first quarter of this year. In the CES 2014 the device was showed, the device can be bent flat and it will revert back to its curved position. </p>
<p> Sprint is also offering a free Quickwindow Folio Case worth $59.99 if you are ordering the device before January 31st, starting today. So what are you waiting for? Get your device booked today. We are expecting many more devices with the curved displays and pretty sure the device will be big successes this year and was available in Korea earlier.

<p> LG G Pro 2 Android Phablet with 5.9-inch 1080p Display Announced – Launch Details, Specs </p>
<p> LG has something cool to showcase at the MWC event this year, as they announce the LG G Pro 2 in an event in Korea, and as expected the device is a 5.9-inch one with a 1080p display and is internally powered by a Snapdragon 800 processor and 3GB DDR3 RAM. This was nothing less than expected, after the last year’s flagship G2 had the 1080p display under the 5.2-inch screen and it also had the same Snapdragon 800 processor, but the RAM was 2GB. </p>
<p> LG G Pro 2 Specifications </p>
<p> Screen: 5.9-inch capacitive touchscreen </p>
<p> Display: Full HD IPS display with slim bezel, 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution </p>
<p> Storage: 16GB / 32GB of internal memory, expandable with micro SD card </p>
<p> Connectivity: LTE / 3G HSPA+, WiFi 802.11 ac/a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP, GPS / aGPS, NFC, SlimPort </p>
<p> Battery: 3200 mAh (Removable) </p>
<p> Earlier: </p>
<p> The LG G Pro 2 is officially going to be unveiled at an event in Korea, on 13th February, for which the electronics company has sent invites already. The event is going to be held at LG Twin Towers in Yeouido, Seoul and the invites read “Knock-knock knockin’ on” which is to indicate about the KnockOn feature, a part of the LG G2’s interface, and this would be a part of the LG G Pro 2 too now. </p>
<p> There are some mouth-watering specs included in the leaked / rumored list, but it’s just within a week from now when we would be able to find the actual specs of the LG G Pro 2. </p>
<p> Earlier: The LG G Pro 2 has showed itself off to the cameras finally, with the new leaks showing the rear side of the device, and unsurprisingly, it’s the physical buttons placed below the camera just like in the LG G2. The device does look decent from the back, and has a rectangular camera module rather than the circular one in the G2. </p>
<p> We aren’t really far away from the MWC 2014 event, where the company is officially unveiling the G Pro 2 with the whooping 6-inch Full HD display, and some high-end specs packed in. </p>
<p> LG has made the LG G Pro 2 Android phablet official, through their Korean website and although the company hasn’t listed any official specs or other details, they made a clear point that the device would be making a debut at the Mobile World Congress 2014. And we are now confident about the name G Pro 2 because the first gen was in the Optimus series, but now LG has said that the name won’t have the earlier branding to it, and thus the name would be LG G Pro 2. </p>
<p> According to the leaks, the specifications of the G Pro 2 would be: </p>
<p> 6-inch Full HD display, or 6-inch Quad HD display </p>
<p> LTE-Advanced support </p>
<p> The MWC 2014 event is not far from now, thus you would be seeing the official details and our hands-on experience with the device, very soon. </p>
<p> Earlier: </p>
<p> The next flagship devices from LG are already being rumored, after the recent launches of the LG G2, LG G Flex and the G Pro (out of the Optimus series under which the Android phones were launched), and the latest one in the rumors is the LG G Pro 2, which is said to be making a debut in a month from now, at the Mobile World Congress 2014 event in Barcelona. This should be the right time for LG to come up with the new flagship device, as the rumored LG G3 isn’t coming anytime in the first half of 2014. </p>
<p> The G Pro 2 would be a good sized phablet with the 6-inch display, which should be an HD one and these are the specs shared by ETNews from Korea. Taking a step ahead from its predecessor, the LG G Pro 2 should be coming with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor (the G Pro had the Snapdragon 600 chipset) and interestingly, the RAM is also going to be upgraded from here, as the G Pro 2 is said to be coming with the 3GB of RAM (the G Pro and G2 had 2GB RAM). If this is true, the G Pro 2 would be a perfect competitor to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 which has a variant with Snapdragon 800 and 3GB of RAM. </p>
<p> Connectivity wise, the rumored phablet is going to have the LTE-A support for some areas such as Korea, and the OS that would be seen out-of-the-box is Android 4.4 KitKat. LG’s interface in the G2 and the other flagships is quite interesting, and LG would be looking to provide some more features with better support for the multitasking, which should be a USP for the device when launched. </p>
<p> The other details are not yet known, and whatever is listed above is just a part of the rumors as no information is officially leaked, but the news that LG would be looking to announce this during the MWC 2014 (along with the LG G2 Mini) would gain quite a lot of attention. Let’s see what LG has planned, in a month from now. </p>

<p> LG G Pro 2 Camera Samples, App Interface & Camera Quality Review </p>
<p> This year seems to be the year of flagships with excellent cameras. Each and every brand has been coming up with smartphones having a lot of advancements in the camera. Samsung came up with the 16MP shooter on the back of Galaxy S5, compared to the 13MP one in the S4 while Sony and LG decided retain the same camera as in the previous gen. device, for the smartphones which were announced in the first quarter of 2014. LG’s G Pro 2 phablet has the same 13-megapixel shooter with the Optical Image Stabilization feature and this was the same seen in the LG G2 smartphone. </p>
<p> For a quick reference, check the camera samples of the previous flagship devices we captured. </p>
<p> Now, talking about the camera in the LG G Pro 2, this one with the OIS+ feature does what is being said, but LG hasn’t done any improvement in the low light capturing as we still see the noise that a low-end camera would have. Just like we said about the camera captures in bright conditions, LG G Pro 2 captures the object beautifully, and the background is defocused quite well. </p>
<p> LG G Pro 2 Camera Samples </p>
<p> 13-megapixel: 4160 x 3120 pixels (4:3) </p>
<p> HD 1280×720 (Slow motion) </p>
<p> How’s the camera quality? We loved the OIS+ feature, as the lens adjusts itself for the small shakes while we walk or are sitting in a car and not standing still, and the modes are also quite excellent, especially the Burst Shot, Sports mode etc., but the capture in low light conditions is not as good as you see with the other smartphone cameras. </p>
<p> LG G Pro 2 Camera App Interface </p>
<p> The camera app from LG is very easy to use and the options are mostly available directly, for the first time users, while for others who have been using the LG Android devices, there’s nothing new to look here, because although there are a couple of changes in the modes, everything is right there as it was before. </p>
<p> Video Recording Quality </p>
<p> There’s a 4k video recording capability with this camera, and as expected the quality is brilliant, and thankfully, you don’t see the phone getting heated up that easily, when compared to the Samsung Galaxy S5 which allowed me to capture a 4K video for just 3 minutes because of the issue of heating up. The 4K video recording sample would be up soon. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> LG G Pro 2 vs LG G Flex Android Phone Comparison – Photos, Video Comparison </p>
<p> The LG G Flex was something different in the world of Android devices, being one of the first devices to feature a curved display and it also came with pretty good specifications. The LG G Pro 2 was unveiled at the MWC 2014 and it is also a pretty good device with few more features added to it from its predecessors. Let’s compare these devices from LG and see what they can deliver. </p>
<p> Form Factor- Size, Shape </p>
<p> 160.50 x 81.60 x 8.70 </p>
<p> 157.90 x 81.90 x 8.30 </p>
<p> The new LG G Pro 2 comes with a 5.9 inch screen where as the LG G Flex had a little bigger screen size with 6 inches, there is not much of a difference we can pick out from these two really big smart phones but the LG G Flex has a curvy display, that actually make it easier to handle. Coming to the design both the devices feature same design and back buttons with thin bezels. The back in the G flex was a self-healing one but we could not find it on the LG G Pro 2, as it comes with matte finish. There is not much of a difference in the Dimensions and weight of the devices as mentioned it above. </p>
<p> Display </p>
<p> 6 Curved P-OLED screen </p>
<p> 5.9 inch IPS Plus LCD </p>
<p> We can find a 720×1280 pixels resolutions on the LG G Flex on its 6 inch screen but the new device has a 1080×1920 pixels resolutions on its 5.9 inch screen, giving brighter and better display from all angles. </p>
<p> [Video Comparison Coming Soon] </p>
<p> Internal Specifications </p>
<p> The internal specifications on both the devices are similar to each other having as they are powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor clocking at 2.2 GHz but the RAM in the G Pro 2 has been increased to 3 GB as it was just 2 GB in the G Flex. Again the GPU is the same in both the device featuring Adreno 330. The battery on the G Flex was slightly on the higher side with 3500 mAh and the new flagship from LG features 3200 mAh battery on its back. </p>
<p> The G Flex run on Android 4.2 Jelly Bean where as the LG G Pro 2 comes out of the box with the latest Android 4.4 KitKat. Moreover the LG G Pro 2 also comes with a new feature called as Knock Code, with which the user can just Knock the screen with a pattern to unlock the device. other than this there is a Mini View feature that lets the user to operate the Smart phone just with one hand as we saw similar feature in the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. </p>
<p> Camera – Rear & Front </p>
<p> Both the devices feature the same 13 MP rear facing camera and 2.1 MP front facing camera but the latest flagship device features the 4K recording feature, which could be seen only in very few devices in the present market. More over it also come with Optical image stabilization making its camera more powerful. </p>
<p> Storage </p>
<p> The LG G flex has a on board storage of 32 GB but does not feature the a micro SD card slot to expand it, but the LG G Pro 2 has a 16 GB in built memory that can be extended with a micro SD card. There is also a 32 GB variant in the LG G Pro 2 but again it won’t make much difference if you have a micro SD card slot to extend the storage. </p>
<p> Pricing and Final Verdict </p>
<p> The pricing is where we would have to take a proper look when LG announces the pricing for the LG G Pro 2, because the LG G Flex had a sky high price and if the company decides to come up with a comparatively lower pricing for the G Pro 2, then this should be an excellent one compared to the G Flex which is quite the same, except for the flexible display. </p>

<p> LG G Pro 2 vs Samsung Galaxy Note 3 – The Ultimate Android Phablets Compared </p>
<p> We have seen the LG G Pro 2 announcing in Korea which claims to be the next flagship from LG. This device will be showcased at the MWC event that is going to start from 24th of this month and many are excited to know more about this device. </p>
<p> On the other hand we have seen the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 being one of the most powerful and smart Phablet with its S-Pen features, and we also listed it in the Best Android Smart Phones to buy this month. Now we are going to compare these two Phablets from LG and Samsung and see that are the similarities and differences between them. This information will help you just in-case if you are planning to buy a new device. </p>
<p> Screen Size and Resolution </p>
<p> Comparing the Screen of both the device we can say the LG G Pro 2 has slight advantage over the Note 3 as the device from LG flaunts a 5.9 inch screen, where as the device from the Samsung sports a 5.7 inch screen. Both the Phablets have the same resolution of 1920 x 1080 but Note 3 has a higher pixel rate of 386 compared to 373 ppi in LG G Pro 2 because of its increased screen size, but again it won’t be a huge difference that a naked eye can catch. The display used in the Note 3 is AMOLED and the LG used the IPS LCD technology for its device. </p>
<p> Body (Weight & Dimensions) </p>
<p> There is not much of a difference between the both the devices in terms of the weight as the device from the LG weights 172 grams and the device from the Samsung weights 168 grams. The thickness of these Phablets is similar with the LG G Pro 2 measuring at 157.9 x 81.9 x 8.3 mm and Note 3 measuring 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm. both the devices are similar in the thickness and weight. </p>
<p> Camera </p>
<p> Once again both the phablets have the same 13 MP rear camera that uses LED flash offering 4K video recording. But the front camera on the LG G Pro 2 is at 2.1 MP and the Note 3 uses a 2 MP camera on its front, so even ever we can’t see much of a difference. </p>
<p> Processor </p>
<p> The LG G Pro 2 clocks at 2.3 GHz and Note 3 clocks at 2.26 GHz, other than this both the chipsets are Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 and both are quad-core also. Moreover both the devices uses a 3 GB RAM to power the device. </p>
<p> Storage </p>
<p> The LG G Pro 2 is available in 16 GB and 32 GB variants, where as the Galaxy Note 3 stepped up the challenge with the 64 GB model. However the memory on both the devices can be increased via microSD card slot. </p>
<p> Operating System </p>
<p> LG is one of the few devices that get fast updates of its Operating Systems, only after the Nexus devices. The LG G Pro 2 comes with Android 4.4 KitKat out of the box, but the Galaxy Note 3 is still running in Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. </p>
<p> Battery </p>
<p> The battery on both the devices is same at 3200 mAh to power the device, so we having nothing to say on this point unless we have our hands on the LG G Pro 2 since battery life varies with the screen technologies used and also with the screen size. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Both these flagship devices hare powerful enough and we could not find much of a difference in both of the devices, we cannot conclude anything for the time being as we need to get the device in our hands to comment more about it, as for now we do not have any details about the global release of this device so we need to wait a little more for laying hands on LG G Pro 2. </p>

<p> LG Nexus 5 Vs OnePlus One Smart Phone Comparison of Specs, Pricing </p>
<p> The LG Nexus 5 is one among the most powerful Smartphones, and it was released late in 2013 and is the easily the best device that Google has offered us till now. This LG-manufactured Google device has a low price tag and is the first to receive all the Google updates. On the other hand we have the OnePlus One Smartphone from OnePlus, the company that has made its self publicized late last year in the month of December has now attracted as many people as a well known brand would do, with its first ever OnePlus One handset which is yet to be released. </p>
<p> Design and Dimensions </p>
<p> Nexus 5 is not known for its great design but it is good enough in the hand and has a simple design with on-screen touch buttons, where as the OnePlus One an elegant design and according to the company the bezel is just 0.07mm and will be coming with customizable back cover in five different options. </p>
<p> Coming to the dimensions, the Nexus 5 has dimensions of 137.9 x 69.2 x 8.6 mm (5.43 x 2.72 x 0.34 inches) and the OnePlus One has the dimensions of 152.9 x 75.9 x 8.9 mm (6.02 x 2.99 x 0.35 inches). When compared to OnePlus One the Nexus 5 is 0.3 mm thinner at 8.6mm and the OnePlus One is at 8.9mm. Nexus 5 is little easier for one hand operations at 137.9 x 69.2mm compared to 152.9 x 75.9mm for OnePlus One, but there are people who prefer bigger handsets. </p>
<p> The Nexus 5 is lighter at 130 grams when compared with its rival OnePlus One which weights 162 grams, this may be mainly because of its bigger size. </p>
<p> Display </p>
<p> The Nexus 5 flaunts a 4.95 inch True HD IPS+ display with 1080 x 1920 pixels resolutions giving a pixel density of 445ppi and on the other hand the OnePlus One has a larger 5.5 inch display with the same 1080 x 1920 resolutions and IPS technology. Since the same resolutions are being used in both the devices the pixel density is bound to be decreasing with bigger screen size so the OnePlus One has 401ppi. </p>
<p> Internal Specifications </p>
<p> The Nexus 5 is powered by a QualcommMSM8974 Snapdragon 800 Quad-core Krait 400 processor clocking at 2.3 GHz, coupled with Adreno 330 GPU and 2 GB of RAM. The OnePlus One is powered by a Qualcomm MSM8974AC Snapdragon 801 quad-core Krait 400 processor clocking at 2.5 GHz, coupled with Adreno 330 GPU and 3 GB of RAM. </p>
<p> We can clearly see that OnePlus One is the winner over here with a faster Snapdragon 801 processor and 3 GB of RAM. This is because the Nexus 5 is more than 6 months old device and used an older version of the Snapdragon chipset. </p>
<p> Coming to the Operating System used, being Google’s own device the Nexus 5 will be running on the latest Android KitKat OS and the OnePlus One will run on CyanogenMod 11S that is based on Android 4.4.2 KitKat. </p>
<p> Camera / Storage </p>
<p> The Nexus 5 has a rather smaller rear camera at 8 MP when compared to the 13 MP rear camera on the OnePlus One Smartphone. The front facing camera is at 1.3 MP on the Nexus device but the OnePlus One has a 5 MP snapper on the front giving better quality video calling and slefies. </p>
<p> Moreoverr the 13 MP camera on the OnePlus One can capture 4K video and the front camera can record at 1080p. Even after all the updates from Google the Nexus 5 camera is underrated and recently it was the camera was tweaked with the Lens Blur feature. </p>
<p> Coming to the storage part, both the devices lack the microSD card slot. The Nexus 5 is available in the 16 GB and 32 GB option where as the OnePlus One offers you the 16 GB and 64 GB options. However both the devices will occupy around 4 GB of memory for the OS itself. </p>
<p> 16 GB /32 GB internal memory, no expandable storage </p>
<p> 16 GB / 64 GB internal memory, no expandable storage </p>
<p> Connectivity/ Battery </p>
<p> The connectivity on the Nexus 5 includes 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band, Bluetooth v4.0 and has a 2300 mAh battery. The OnePlus One has the connectivity’s like 4G, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual band, Bluetooth v4.1 and there is a 3100 mAh battery to power the device </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> The SIM free model of the Nexus 5 is priced at $349 for the 16 GB version and $399 for the 32 GB option on the other hand the 16 GB version of the OnePlus One is priced at $299 and the 64 GB variant at $349. The Nexus 5 is available around the globe but the OnePlus one is yet to be released. We have not used the OnePlus One yet so we cant give a verdict on it but Nexus 5 is also a well equipped device when compared to many other flagship devices in today’s market. </p>

Initially, Nexus 4 by Google – LGE device will only be retailing in US, UK, Australia, France, Germany, Spain, Canada and Japan countries but in coming days we can expect more countries to be added in the list. </p>
<p> Update on October, 29, 2012: Now, this will Kill all the rumors about the LG Nexus 4 which Google will release very shortly. Unfortunately, due to Cyclone which has hit the United States, Monday’s event has been cancelled. Though there is no exact date on by when there will be an Official release, we managed to get the Instruction Manual which you can download the same as this consists all the specifications of LG Nexus 4. </p>
<p> Update: The Carphone Warehouse website has listed the LG Nexus 4 device, and revealed most of the information of the device. One of the noticeable specification is the Android 4.2 OS with which it would be launched. And what was being rumored around was almost true because the specs show that the Nexus 4 is going to have a 4.7-inch touchscreen and a Quad Core Snapdragon S4 processor supported by a 2GB RAM. </p>
<p> The dimensions of the LG Nexus 4 would be 68.7 x 133.9 x 9.1 mm and it is going to carry an 8-megapixel camera and the internal memory of the device would be 8GB. For the monthly contract price of 31 pounds, you would have to pay nothing upfront to get this device through O2 and Vodafone in UK. If you opt not to go with the contract, the SIM free version of the Nexus 4 would be available for the price of £389.95. The official launch date is going to be October 29th, and we will find something interesting, if anything apart from the specs we shared, on the same day. </p>
<p> Oct 15th, 2012 </p>
<p> A bit of data from Google Picasa album has revealed about the latest LG Nexus 4 device, which as coded as the E960 by the company, and this is the remodeled version of the LG Optimus G device, whose revealing was done by the Belarusian site Onliner. The pictures uploaded on Google Picasa usually have a list of information when the EXIF data is checked, and that is where the model was shown as Nexus 4. </p>
<p> The entry of the LG E960 was no more a rumor till the recent time, but what now is being almost confirmed is that the E960 would be called as the LG Nexus 4. Although whatever the leaked pics are being shown could be totally faked by editing them, but it was not the first time the name Nexus 4 has come into existence. The final confirmation could be done only when the Korean manufacturer LG would launch it into the market, and the date being rumored is 29th October. </p>
<p> The LG E960 is going to have a Quad-core Snapdragon S4 processor, 2GB of RAM and a hefty display of 4.7-inch size and the screen resolution would be 1280 x 768 pixels. There was a round of rumor claiming that the device would come into the market with the next version of Android, i.e. Android 4.2 version but as of now the leaked pics showed the Android 4.1.2 version, but there is quite some time for the device to be launched and it could come in with the 4.2 till then. </p>
<p> Something attractive on the device was the back panel, and even the comparison shot between the Apple iPhone 5 and the LG Nexus 4, where the display of the LG’s upcoming device looked solid and better compared to the iPhone. The back panel has got the tiny dots just something like the Windows screensaver having horizontal and vertical shooting dots. </p>
<p> We haven’t got any details or rumored specifications about the Nexus 4, and there isn’t any confirmation whether it would be the same processor that was in talks, but the screen size of 4.7-inches is confirmed based on the pictures itself. When the name Nexus gets included, it supposedly should be something to do with Google rather than LG totally, but let’s wait to see what comes out in the end. </p>

<p> LG Optimus 3D P920 3G Phone Launch in India at Rs 37,000 </p>
<p> The Europe users have enjoyed the taste of 3D on mobile using the LG Optimus 3D. LG has announced that this 3D smartphone will be arriving in India in September 2011. LG Optimus 3D was one of the most talked phone at Mobile World Congress as it rocked with 3D display. Although 3D is slowly prevalent in other digital products like TVs and camera, it’s not a mainstream technology when comes to mobile phones. I remembers the other two 3D phones out in the market are HTC EVO 3D available only in United States through Sprint and Sharp Lynx 3D available in Japan through DoCoMo. Also Disney glass free 3D mobile phone based out of Sharp Galapagos 003SH is another one. </p>
<p> The LG Optimus 3D is an Android based mobile phone running Froyo operating system but it can be upgraded to Gingerbread OS. Proud owner of this mobile phone can watch 3D content and also record 3D videos using the camera provided with this mobile phone. </p>
<p> The LG Optimus 3D features a glasses free 3D 4.3 inches LCD touchscreen display. Its powered by 1 GHz of dual core processor. It also includes a 5 mega pixel camera on the rear side and a VGA camera on the front side. The 5 mega pixel camera on the rear is good enough to capture videos at 1080p HD and 720p HD with 3D. The 3G games on this mobile would be fun to play. Fortunately you don’t need 3D glasses to view the 3D content on this mobile. </p>
<p> And the HDMI output, microUSB port, WiFi Connectivity and 3G HSDPA support are the major highlights of the mobile handset. </p>
<p> LG Optimus 3D is priced at Rs 37,000 in India. The LG Optimus 3D has sleek design, dual core processor. International users have adjusted as this mobile has no 4G but in India I think it will have something prove. </p>

<p> LG G2 Android Phone Officially Launched in India – Specifications & Exceptional Features </p>
<p> The LG India Team has finally launched the G2 Smart Phone in India at a price of Rs 41500 for 16 Gb variant and Rs 43500 for the 32 Gb variant with some interesting options. The phone is already available for Pre-order from the past few days and the pricing is around Rs 40490 for 16gb which is on the same lines as the Galaxy S4 and the Sony Xperia Z1. </p>
<p> 7 August, 2013 : The G2 Android smartphone from LG is just unveiled at an event, and this one is the company’s flagship device with a screen size of 5.2 inch, having a Full HD 1080p resolution. Moving away from the Optimus line, LG has removed the word and thus the “LG G2” name is what is given for it. The smartphone is coming to 130 carriers around the world, and the timing for its launch comes quite right, to compete with the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the upcoming iPhone from Apple. </p>
<p> The entire smartness comes from the buttons, which are shifted from the sides to the back, as you would have the options to lock, power on/off and toggle the volumes all from the rear side below the camera. This would be the best for its one-handed operation in the easiest way. Internally, the G2 is pretty much powered with the Snapdragon 800 processor clocked at 2.26GHz, 2GB of RAM and the battery included inside the device is 3000 mAh. </p>
<p> As of now we got to know that the device might be coming in two variants, one with the 16GB and the other 32GB version. A different graphics RAM is integrated within the display, which the company says will reduce the energy usage by the screen. The camera’s position is not much disturbed, lying on the top center part, with the 13-megapixel lens with the Optical image stabilization, and the flash lies just beside it. </p>
<p> Some of the exceptional features exclusively seen on the LG G2 includes: </p>
<p> Answer Me: Just similar to the Galaxy S4, lift the smartphone near the ear and the call is answered, but here you would need to lower the ringtone </p>
<p> Plug & Pop: When a headphone or earphone is attached to the device, there’s a list of options and features that are given to choose from </p>
<p> Text Link: The information that is embedded in a text message, can be selected and directly saved in a memo or calendar, and the same can be searched on the internet </p>
<p> Slide Aside: Multitasking can be done in an easier way by sliding open the apps to the side using a three-finger swipe </p>
<p> QuickRemote: Apart from the general controlling of the entertainment devices, the LG G2 can operate multiple devices with a lot of customization </p>
<p> Guest Mode: There is a secondary unlock pattern, which if opened, it’s a guest access where the privacy of the owner is well protected, and only certain selected apps will be visible to the guests </p>
<p> The thickness of 8.9mm doesn’t keep the phone anywhere in the list of the slimmest devices, but we won’t be looking for it when the actual required specs are quite good. Just to keep it easier for you, here are the specs we got to know before the live page from the company goes live: </p>
<p> 5.2-inch capacitive touchscreen </p>
<p> 1080p Full HD display </p>
<p> Snapdragon 800 processor, clocked at 2.26 GHz, Quad Krait CPU </p>
<p> Battery: 3000 mAh </p>
<p> 16GB, 32GB versions </p>
<p> A good news for the fans from the U.S., LG has done all the setup to bring the device through the four major networks in the US. </p>
<p> Earlier: August 7th 2013, by Chetan Bhawani </p>
<p> It is now confirmed that on 8th, LG is going to unveil the all new LG Optimus G2 Android smartphone and before the launch itself, there’s a couple of leaked press pics made available. The G2 looks extremely neat and for now we don’t have any official details but will get to know about them as soon as the device is unveiled tomorrow. For now, check the press shots below, leaked by Evleaks. </p>
<p> Earlier: Nov 27th, 2012 by Chetan Bhawani </p>
<p> The successor to the Optimus G smartphone is in a round of rumors right now, with the South Korean electronics company LG planning to launch the Optimus G2 somewhere around in May 2013. The first gen Optimus G has been in talks always for having a limited availability, and not being shipped globally but LG has kept ignoring that and might have some other plans for the next generation of the phone which is expected to have some big upgrades and entering the 5-inch category where some beasts are competing each other (includes the HTC Droid DNA, J Butterfly, Oppo Find 5 etc.). </p>
<p> The actual scheduled launch of a major device from LG is somewhere in the second half of next year, but the company is rescheduling it and would launch it in the second quarter, in order to compete with the Galaxy S4 which might launch by that time, from the fierce competitor in the Android market, Samsung. Some stunning upgrades include the one in the screen and processor, with the 4.7-inch screen of Optimus G being upgraded to 5-inch with a Full HD display. </p>
<p> From the rumors, it has been learned that the processor could be a 2GHz quad-core Qualcomm CPU one, while it was already a quad-core processor in the Optimus G too having a speed of 1.5GHz. The shocker though is that there could be the Android Key Lime Pie operating system coming loaded in the G2, which one wouldn’t be able to confirm because its not a long time since the Android Jelly Bean and its next JB version 4.1 have been launched, and Google might be taking some time to come up with the next version, either the 4.3 or 5.0. </p>
<p> Apart from the devices which we mentioned above, Sony too has been working on the “Yuga” with the big display, and Samsung could be launching one of the devices with a 5-inch HD display pretty soon. Looking at the list being built quite fast, the normal standards in the coming days would be a 5-inch screens with the 1080p HD displays. LG, just like Samsung could have an upper hand in launching the flagship devices with the new OS versions, because the company even launched the LG Nexus 4 phone with the Android 4.1 version, being the first phone in the market with that OS version. </p>
<p> Whatever the reasons could be, but if LG managed to launch the device somewhere around the launch of the successor of the Galaxy S3, we would see a good competition in the high-end devices market. We’d update you as soon as something interesting comes up from the manufacturers or the sources. </p>

<p> LG Optimus L3 II, L5 II, L7 II Smart Phones – Leaked Specs & Features </p>
<p> With the Mobile World Congress just a couple of weeks away, lots of new smartphones are expected from multiple manufacturers. Being one among them, LG had sent out a teaser indicating a new bunch of smartphones to be unveiled at MWC and little was known about it except the fact that LG was coming out with a few interesting devices. </p>
<p> However, the tables seem to have turned and now the specifications and features of the devices along with their model numbers have been leaked. </p>
<p> LG Optimus L7 </p>
<p> LG Optimus L3 II </p>
<p> This would be an entry-level device from LG and comes with a 3.2 inch screen and a 1Ghz Processor. Its predecessor, the LG Optimus L3 however had only an 800 Mhz processor and it does look like LG has pepped up the processing unit on this one. Also, the L3 II comes with a 5MP camera compared to the 3.2MP one on the older version of it. Pretty much that, and the L3 II does look very similar to the Optimus L3 and as an addition, there’s an IPS panel attached to the display too. A good set of features to add onto a basic entry-level smartphone, isn’t it? </p>
<p> LG Optimus L5 II </p>
<p> The L series from LG also has its own mid-end variant named the L5. What LG looks like it is coming up with is the LG Optimus L5 II. Powered by a 1GHz Cortex-A9 CPU, it is a great upgrade over the 800Mhz processor the original L5 from LG had back then. Added to it, LG has slapped a Graphics unit too, powered by the PowerVR SGX531 GPU and comes with Android 4.1.2. The L5 II is said to be an 4-inch device with a WVGA touchscreen, and there’s no information about the IPS capabilities of this display though. </p>
<p> LG Optimus L7 II </p>
<p> The L7 II is the successor of the quite famous LG Optimus L7. It comes with a 4.3-inch IPS display (800 x 480 resolution) and packs a 1GHz Qualcomm MSM8225 processor under its hood. The phone also sports a neat 8MP rear camera and it is supposed that it’d shoot HD Video too. The L7 II comes with 768MB of RAM and a Adreno 203 GPU unit on it too. With a fresh version of Android, 4.1.2 over it, it’s powered by a 2460mAh battery under the hood. </p>
<p> The L series from LG is known for their simple and cost-effective functionality in multiple regions of the world. The successor of the L3, L5 and the L7 do seem competitive if priced right. More information is awaited during MWC 2013, keep watching this space for more information. </p>

<p> LG Optimus LTE P936 Spotted – Leaked Photos & Specs </p>
<p> After a series of smartphones launches at CES 2012 and Mobile World Congress this year, LG Electronics has slowed down the launches of smartphone. LG this year has certainly made it big with its devices like LG Optimus Vu, LG Optimus LTE, LG L3, L5 and L7 smartphone and bigger of them is the LG Optimus 4x HD. </p>
<p> LG Optimus LTE P936 Smartphone </p>
<p> Here comes the LTE P936 smartphone which is another Optimus LTE variant. The LG Optimus LTE P936 gets a leak on the web and this will be the upcoming smartphone by LG Electronics. LTE P936 more often looks like the Optimus LTE SU 640 which was introduced in South Korea in the last year of 2011. Optimus LTE SU 640 features a specifications as 4.5 inches HD display, 1.5 Ghz dual core processor, 8 mega pixel camera and Android 2.3 Gingerbread and we might see nearly the same specifications for Optimus LTE P936 which is due in the second quarter this year. The improvements we might see are the upgrade to quad core and it might include Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich OS on the board itself. LTE P936 smartphone suggests that it might ne not for the Korean market and its likely to be introduced in United States and Canada or in Europe. As of now these are just the assumptions and we will hear more about this in the coming weeks. </p>
<p> LG hasn’t made anything clear about this device and they might come up with this smartphone official announcement in a week or so. </p>

<p> LG G Pro 2 Hands-on Video, Photo Gallery and First Impressions from MWC 2014 </p>
<p> The Knock Knock gets better, with the LG G Pro 2 being annnounced by LG and we have got a hands-on with the device, and seriously, this is one of the best devices to look out for! Running the Android 4.4 KitKat, the G Pro 2 comes with a 5.9-inch huge display, which is something in the likes of the Galaxy Note 3 from Samsung, but the external look is unique from the brand, which was first used in the LG G2 with the new button placement on the back panel and the flat sides having no button clutter, and just the connectivity ports. The Korean manufacturer has made this one with the 4k video recording, making this into the list of the very limited number of Android devices having that feature, and there´s a lot more to talk about the G Pro 2. </p>
<p> The device looks excellent in hands, comfortable to hold and the back buttons don’t disturb on the palm, thanks to the large screen size which covers most of the palm area below the buttons. The interface is not really different from what we have seen in the LG G2, but there are a few new features which you would love, especially if you are one of those users who keep themselves interested in the innovative stuff. </p>
<p> LG G Pro 2 Hands-on Video </p>
<p> In the physical aspect, you won’t see any real difference in the looks from the G2, but the differences are: </p>
<p> The speaker placement, from the bottom in G2 to the back panel in the G Pro 2 </p>
<p> Removable back cover in the G Pro 2 </p>
<p> TV Antenna in the Korean variant of G Pro 2 </p>
<p> Front camera shifted to right of the earpiece, which goes to the edge of the front body </p>
<p> The screen unlocking is now possible with a new feature called the Knock Code, and not the Knock On, and the Knock code takes the unlocking to a new level with security. Once you have set it up, the screen can be unlocked with a pattern of touches at appropriate places. The other new features that you see in the G Pro 2, include the Mini View feature where the one-handed operation comes into the scene. You can shrink the screen by swiping on the bottom screen buttons and it would give you a pop-up screen, which is the shrunken version of the interface. The size of this could be changed, and it can be dragged from up to down, left to right and vice versa. </p>
<p> The G Pro 2 has got the Optical Image Stabilization 2 feature which comes with a better stability while capturing the photos and videos, and the best part – 4K video recording, the UHD videos resolution capture capability to the resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels. It’s quite brilliant in quality, but the storage could pose an issue when you try to capture long 4K videos. The back cover is removable, and thus you can expand the storage with the MicroSD card. </p>
<p> It’s really not much different from the LG G Flex, as there is just a slight difference in the screen size and the features, but they look similar from the front and back, while only the side view would show the difference easily. The device is running the Android 4.4.2 KitKat OS, and that’s the latest OS in the Android platform right now. </p>
<p> Overall, it’s a brilliant device for the first experience, but we cannot already assess how much life would the 3200 mAh battery of the LG G Pro 2 might have on the continuous usage. </p>

<p> LG G Pro 2 Phone (LTE Variant) Photo Gallery </p>
<p> The LG G Pro 2 took the inspiration of the surface from its predecessor Optimus G Pro, while the other design aspects were inspired from the LG G2. We got the LTE variant of the G Pro 2, and this neatly designed device has all the buttons on the rear side, below the camera. The ports are on the side panels, and the color of the phone we got is Titan, while the other color options available are White, Silver, Burgundy and Red. </p>
<p> Check the photo gallery below, followed by the specifications and the details of the phablet from LG, which made its entry into the market early this year. </p>
<p> The G Pro 2 comes with the beautiful design and a very beautiful 5.9-inch display, and I might be one of those always arguing about the placement of the buttons on the back panel, but LG has retained that design from the LG G2, and this actually, doesn’t look bad at all for the huge screen as you now get an access to the buttons easily. </p>
<p> The phablet is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor and there is 3GB RAM supporting it, while the internal storage is 16GB while you can easily pop-in a MicroSD card for the storage expansion. The LG’s interface looks pretty cool and there are a lot of enhancements from the previous version, thanks to the Android 4.4.2 KitKat OS. Check out the LG G Pro 2 camera samples to check out how good the 13MP camera with the OIS+ is, and this coming with the 4K recording is an added advantage. </p>
<p> You know why the screen looks so good? it’s the wallpapers. You could download the LG G Pro2 wallpapers if you wanted to have them on your phone screen and make it look better. </p>

<p> LG Ray with 5.5″ HD Display and 13MP Camera Launched in Russia at 14,990 Rubles </p>
<p> After launching the metal-clad LG Zero smartphone in Europe earlier this month, the South Korean giant has now launched a smartphone in Russia called as LG Ray. The LG Ray is a mid-ranged smartphone and is available in offline stores priced at 14,990 rubles (roughly $226/Rs. 15,100). </p>
<p> Talking about the specifications, the Ray flaunts a 5.5-inch HD (720×1280 pixels) IPS display with pixel density of 267ppi and comes powered MediaTek MT6592M octa-core processor clocked at 1.4GHz coupled with Mali 400 GPU. The device comes with 1GB RAM, 16GB built-in storage and microSD card slot for expansion upto 32GB. It supports dual sim dual standby and runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop out of the box. </p>

<p> LG Rolling out Android 5.0 “LOLLIPOP” to LG G3 – DETAILS </p>
<p> LG Electronics Inc. confirmed that it would begin updating G3 handsets with the new Android 5.0 Lollipop mobile operating. Users in Poland will be the first to download the new mobile operating system. Users in other markets should anticipate the Android 5.0 update in coming weeks with the smartphone manufacturer saying it will soon announce a release schedule for other mobile devices. We’re yet to see the global rollout of updates for the Nexus devices, or those of Motorola, which were among the fastest to update to Android 4.4 KitKat. Android 5.0 Lollipop is already running on the Nexus 9 tablet, and it will ship with the Nexus 6 smartphone, which is expected to be released Wednesday. </p>
<p> LG Electronics Mobile Communications Co. CEO and President Jong-seok Park said in a statement that LG is absolutely committed to giving our customers the best mobile experiences available, and bringing Android Lollipop to G3 owners as soon as possible is a top priority. The new features and improvements in Android 5.0 will bring a whole new user experience to the G3 and make it even better than it already is. </p>
<p> Last week Motorola had posted the release notes for Lollipop on the 2014 Moto X , but they were immediately pulled down. Android 5.0 is currently rolling out to Moto X owners who signed up for the smartphone’s “soak test” and could see a wider release should they not report any glaring errors. The decision to pull down the pages describing the update could mean that Motorola jumped the gun, and will not officially roll out the software for a few days. The first Moto X model to receive Android 5.0 is Motorola’s unlocked “Pure Edition”. </p>
<p> Google has delayed the Android 5.0 Lollipop update for the Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 7 and Nexus 10. It will now roll out on November 12; exactly a week after it was initially meant to launch. Google has decided to delay the update in order to iron out some last minute bugs. Apparently there are a couple of necessary fixes required before the system is ready to be rolled out to older Nexus devices. The Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 are the first to run Android Lollipop. </p>

<p> LG V10 with Auxiliary Ticker Display & 16MP Rear Camera Likely to Unveil on Oct 1 </p>
<p> Update Sep 15: Earlier today, LG has started sending media invites to a press event to be held on October 1 in New York City. Though the company did not reveal any details about the products, the event will focus on but we can expect the rumored LG V10 smartphone to be unveiled at this event. </p>
<p> Earlier Sep 4: LG has already announced that it will launch its next flagship device later this year and is likely to be announced on October 10. Beside the next flagship device rumour another mysterious device from LG has been spotted at China’s telecom regulator TENAA. </p>
<p> According to Tipster Evan Blass, LG is developing a new device dubbed as LG V10 with secondary “auxiliary ticker display” that is placed above the main screen and V10 branding at the back panel of the device. The Samsung Continuum launched on Verizon is the first and the only device to feature a secondary “ticker display” way back in 2010. Apart from it no other device was developed with “auxiliary ticker display.” As per the new leaks LG V10 might become the next device to feature a secondary ticker display. </p>
<p> LG V10 sports a 5.7-inch Quad HD (2560×1440) display as well as a small auxiliary ticker display above the main screen. It comes powered by Snapdragon 808 hexa-core processor along with 3GB RAM, 64GB internal storage and a microSD slot for expansion. The device sports a 16MP rear camera with LED flash and a 5MP front-facing snapper. We can also see the integrated fingerprint scanner, rear mounted volume rockers and power button in the leaked images. </p>
<p> The LG V10 has a weird look with front-facing cameras embedded in the left corner underneath the display itself. As per the sources, the secondary ticker display functions similarly to the Samsung Continuum and is also set similarly to that device. Although nothing is official, as it is listed at TENAA, the LG V10 is sure to make way in the month of October. </p>

<p> LG V10 with Auxiliary Ticker Display & 16MP Rear Camera Officially Launched </p>
<p> LG has created a lot of buzz about the launch of its next flagship device later this year. Earlier this month the company also sent the media invites for an event scheduled on October 1st in New York. Today, LG has officially launched the first smartphone in its latest V series called LG V10. The device will be available this month first in its home country Korea and later followed by the U.S, China, Latin America, Middle East, and few of the Asian countries. </p>
<p> The main highlight of the LG V10 is secondary “auxiliary ticker display” that is placed above the main screen and V10 branding at the back panel of the device. The Samsung Continuum launched on Verizon is the first and the only device to feature a secondary “ticker display” way back in 2010. Apart from it no other device was developed with “auxiliary ticker display.” LG V10 has become the next device to feature a secondary ticker display. </p>
<p> LG V10 sports a 5.7-inch Quad HD (2560×1440) display as well as a small 2.1-inch IPS Quantum auxiliary ticker display with a resolution of 160 x 1040 above the main screen. It comes powered by Snapdragon 808 hexa-core processor along with 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage and a microSD slot for expansion. The device sports a 16MP rear camera with LED flash and two 5MP front-facing snappers, one with 120 degrees wide angle, while the other with just 80 degrees. Like other LG devices, the LG V10 also comes with the power button and volume rockers placed on the rear side. The power button comes embedded with a fingerprint sensor. </p>
<p> V10 also features the same camera as the LG G4, but it comes with enhanced camera software capabilities for video shooting. V10 users will have full control over things like ISO, shutter speed, focus, frame rate. The V10 camera has both optical and electronic image stabilization and can also shoot videos in HD, FHD or UHD resolution and also has an option to shoot videos in 21:9 aspect ratio. </p>
<p> The LG V10 has a weird look with two front-facing cameras embedded in the left corner underneath the display itself. The Secondary Ticker Display functions similarly to the Samsung Continuum and is also set similarly to that device. The secondary “always on” screen will show the notifications when the main screen is off, and it works similarly like the Edge screen seen in the Samsung’s Galaxy S6 and Note Edge devices. LG V10 will be available in colors- Black, White, Beige, and two different Blues. </p>

<p> I’m still a fan of the Apex Launcher, but started using the Google Experience Launcher with built in Google Now and love it. I wish Apex or Nova would copy the Google Experience Launcher with Google Now. </p>
<p> After using Go Launcher EX and Lightning Launcher, I tried Zeam Launcher and like it a lot! It is very user-friendly and quick. Thanks for the tip! </p>
<p> The only thing missing is the ability to change app icons. Would love to apply some sort of minimal icon set to go along with this launcher (without having to rely on another app to do it). </p>
<p> Freakin awesome, I was using Go Launcher but this this is way more lighter and smoother </p>
<p> tried it ages ago and installed it again after reading this article and seeing the ratings on the market or…play store or w/e it is now still prefer sense, go launcher and qq launcher to it. could be down to my model of phone, hTC desire s </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> List of Android Phones getting Android 4.4 KitKat Firmware Update [Sony, HTC Official List, Samsung, Micromax Updated List] </p>
<p> The Android 4.4 KitKat version was recently announced and it is soon to be officially launched by Google when they would be coming up with the next version of Nexus, the Nexus 5 device. But it would always be a guessing game for the users, to see whether the 4.4 update would be coming to their device or not. With most of the high-end devices that were launched recently, one can easily expect that they would be receiving the KitKat update, but for the earlier devices, you will have to wait to see whether the manufacturer is deciding to send the update and whether the device hardware would be able to support it. </p>
<p> For now, keep checking the list below (updated daily) as soon as we get the information from the sources on the devices which are going to get the next big version of Android OS. </p>
<p> Update: Nexus Phones Android 4.4 Update </p>
<p> The Galaxy Nexus won’t get Android 4.4 as quoted by Google, because it has crossed the 18 month window period, while the later devices such as the Nexus 7, Nexus 10 would be getting the Android 4.4 update soon. The Nexus 5 which was launched today, would be coming with the 4.4 out of the box. </p>
<p> Samsung Phones to get Android 4.4 Update </p>
<p> For now, there is an internal Samsung Knox document which was leaked, and which showed a few devices which are going to get the Android 4.4 update, and the document actually showed the devices which would get the Samsung Knox in the coming update. The devices are as follows: </p>
<p> The Galaxy S3 and Note II have been facing a few regional lock issues and that is what is prompting Samsung to come up with a major update on these devices, as confirmed by one of the Samsung representatives. But again, the document mentions it is the S3 which has 2GB of RAM, and that is the U.S. version which might be getting the update, and the International users might have to wait and watch if Samsung has made it ready for their devices too or not. </p>
<p> * A report from SamMobile has now suggested that the Galaxy S4 mini, Galaxy S3 mini, Galaxy S Advance, Galaxy Ace 3, Galaxy Core, Galaxy Fame, Galaxy Ace 2, and the Galaxy Fresh are the devices which they are testing the new OS version on, so it would be a possibility for these devices to run the Android 4.4 KitKat, not very soon though. </p>
<p> Sony Phones to get Android 4.4 Update </p>
<p> Sony has officially updated the list of the Android phones in the Xperia range which are going to receive the Android 4.4 KitKat update, and these mostly include the recent high-end smartphones. The exact dates are not mentioned, but here are the smartphones which would receive the KitKat update sooner or later. </p>
<p> Sony Xperia SP (the official website has listed KitKat in the future updates of the smartphone) </p>
<p> The company did mention a few devices which are supposedly going to get the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean update and that directs us to a point that these devices aren’t going to receive the KitKat update any time soon. The Xperia T, Xperia TX and Xperia V are the ones which would get the Android 4.3 update directly from Android 4.1 JB, and the devices mentioned above will be getting the Android 4.3 before they see the KitKat update rolling out. </p>
<p> HTC Phones to get Android 4.4 Update </p>
<p> The HTC One Max is to be announced very soon, and that should be anyways getting the update after the launch, but the devices which are expected to get the Android 4.4 KitKat update after its launch, includes HTC One. </p>
<p> Update: HTC has officially named a few devices on its Twitter account, and these are the smartphones which would be getting the Android 4.4 KitKat update. HTC One (Verizon Wireless) – end of Jan 2014 HTC Droid DNA – around the end of Quarter 1, 2014 after the approval from the carrier </p>
<p> The other phones where the update is still expected, but with no official update from HTC, include: </p>
<p> LG Phones to get Android 4.4 Update </p>
<p> We did hear that the LG Optimus G Pro might be receiving the update a little later, but the LG G2, latest flagship smartphone from the company is sure to get the KitKat version of Android very soon after the launch. </p>
<p> LG Optimus L7, L5, L3 </p>
<p> LG Optimus G </p>
<p> Micromax Phones to get Android 4.4 Update </p>
<p> There is a new rumored list of Micromax Android phones which are going to receive the Android 4.4 KitKat update, but this is not an official list from the company itself. Check whether you own one of these devices, which could be getting the KitKat version of Android sooner or later. This is through a photo uploaded by MMXNewscaster, one of the sources which leaks the information about Micromax phones. </p>
<p> This is just the initial list, which is subject to change anytime once we keep seeing some actual confirmation or leak from the sources. We would try to keep updating this page every time there’s some news flowing around. </p>
<p> Note: Do comment which Android phone you own, and we will be letting you know whether the KitKat update would be coming to that device or not. </p>
<p> Digiflip XT811 Tablet currently runs on older Android 4.2 OS. Flipkart claims the new tablets will be getting the Android 4.4 KitKat software update. </p>
<p> Yes the chances are good for the same, considering Google had purchased Motorola sometime back. Most of the devices from Moto are expected to get the latest releases atleast for 1 year from launch. </p>

<p> I own Huawei P6-U06, running Android version 4.2.2. Do I expect an update on my phone sooner or later? – NHRashdi. </p>
<p> Just to let you know, the reason your device will not receive kitkat is due to a hardware upgrade that is needed for the new credit card software that requires this hardware to make purchases in the real near future (Google apps are already updating and the reason you cannot purchase anything through these updated apps) as well as making payments via device to device direct from your bank account to theirs through the world banking computer systems. </p>
<p> Hello folks .Well this is great news .I’ve been hoping for awhile now that there would be an update . I have a Samsung Galaxy tab 2 10.1 p5113 . Does anyone know when its coming…. </p>

<p> What about Sony Xperia Ion? I purchased it with ICS in April’13 and got the JB update in July’13. Shall I expect KK by the end of this year? </p>
<p> Sorry to disappoint you, but Sony has already ended support for Xperia ION. This means that you will not be getting any further updates from Sony. </p>
<p> you can head over to the Galaxy S3 section for updating the device with the latest version of KitKat 4,4 </p>

<p> Are u sure that LG Optimus G will be upgraded to android v 4.4? Is it official information? </p>
<p> It’s not an official info about the Optimus G. We will update you as soon as we get to know something. For now, the HTC and Sony lists are the official ones. </p>
<p> I own the LG Optimus L9 by T-Mobile, please email me to let me know whether or not there is an update for my device </p>
<p> Update will be available via custom ROM firmware makers. We will come up with the procedure v soon </p>
<p> as of now there are no updates on the same, but we can be optimistic about the custom ROM firmwares of Kit kAT </p>
<p> I am using samsung galaxy grand duos..Please tell me when will Android Kitkat 4.4 will be updatedto my phone </p>
<p> It will get the custom ROm firmware for sure which will bring in the goodness of Kit Kat </p>
<p> 🙂 🙂 🙂 I’m sorry for this, but, it’s funny cause you commented with your phone and they said not to do that (and that they would tell you which phones are getting the update) haha </p>
<p> I Own Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II. Any Update For This Phone.I Am Using In Android OS, v2.3.4 (Gingerbread) Version. </p>
<p> what about the LG Optimus L9 will it get Kit Kat. Does it even stand a chance? io hate how LG is so slow on updates </p>
<p> I have Galaxy Note N7000 (note1). is it going to get a firmware upate for Kitkat? </p>
<p> If not, then is there a way where i can update it manually?. Please let me know if it’s possible and what all need for the same. </p>
<p> I own a Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini. It would be ridiculous If this device doesn’t get the Kit Kat update. There’s already a working one on the XDA forums so Samsung doesn’t have any excuses. </p>
<p> i ve samsung grand running android 4.2.2 With a quad core processor, and 1GB ram. Will it get the 4.4 update? </p>
<p> You didn’t mention any motorola device. I have moto droid razr hd. Is it getting kitkat update? </p>
<p> Hey cheetan first of all thanks for the usefull post and i would suggest you to not make another post for Android 4.4 KitKat firmware (I bookmarked it and i will keep visiting this post). </p>
<p> I have Samsung Galaxy Garand Duos; no Android 4.4 KitKat firmware for me? :-/ </p>
<p> I am having Samsung Galaxy S Duos GT-S7562? wHETHER i WILL BE GETTING kITKAT 4.4 UPDATE?? </p>
<p> I am having Sony Xperia S. Is this phone compatible for new andriod Kit Kat updation? </p>
<p> What about LG L9? There are listed L3, L5 and L7 but I don’t see L9 which is the best one of the series. Are there any news about Kit Kat for L9? Please let me know. </p>
<p> I have lg optimus e510. Please let me know, if my device will get a kitkat update </p>
<p> I have a Lg Optimus G. Lg isn’t so fast with their updates… But i still have hope! </p>
<p> Htc one x getting update to 4.4 but lg optimus 4x hd won’t? Come on Lg, this is my last Lg phone! </p>
<p> I think it would be unfair if Samsung won’t update SAMSUNG GALAXY S2. S2 was their best-seller in 2011 and was once a flagship device. Please be considerate Samsung! Besides, ANDROID 4.4 Kit-Kat is meant to run on lower-end devices, right? IF DEVS COULD PORT KITKAT ON S2 THEN THERE IS NO REASON SAMSUNG WON’T BE ABLE TO DO IT! </p>
<p> LG 4X HD P880 What the hell with LG? P880/ 4X HD have quad core processor, 1giga ram and not on list??? </p>
<p> What did u have to do to get PA 4.3 on ur G Pro? Would it be troublesome to give me a step-by-step? If u are willing to do that, I’d greatly appreciate it. </p>
<p> I guess nobody read the note at the bottom hahaha. I just wish it said when we would get the update- I don’t expect to see.it on my S4 for several months, though. </p>
<p> Sony Xperia L C2104 any chance of getting Android 4.3/4.4 update?? as many people claim that Android 4.4 KitKat is capable of running on devices with just 512mb of RAM..?? </p>
<p> I have the Samsung Galaxy S2 Epic 4G Touch (Sprint variant/SPH-D710). I’ve had Jelly Bean 4.1.2 for several months now. If any of the S2 phones get 4.4 Kit Kat, it should be these! </p>
<p> I think your expectations for LG phones (and maybe others) is based on pure speculation. I own an LG Optimus G, which is stilll on 4.1.2 – except for one highly doubtful statement from LG France, I’ve not head anywhere else that the phone will get Kitkat. Mind you, this phone is very close to the Nexus 4 hardware wise, and even still LG hasn’t bothered to update 4.2 or 4.3. Can you please explain where you got your info from? </p>
<p> I have a Lava Xolo Q1000 running android 4.2.1 With a quad core processor, and 1 gb ram. Will it get the 4.4 update? </p>
<p> Nexus 4 should not be under LG list since it will get the update from Google, instead of LG. </p>
<p> So any update on if or when the ASUS transformer tab tf300t will get kit-kat cause im dying to mqke my own photosphere on my tab!!!! </p>
<p> I have the same phone and I VERY MUCH doubt it. We didn’t even get an official version of Jelly Bean on the Evo V 4G so an “official” KitKat update is highly unlikely. </p>
<p> will be interesting to see if the Optimus G Pro gets Kit-Kat. This was LG’s flagship just before the G2 was released and it’s been tossed away and forgotten except by us G Pro users. At least our bootloader has been bypassed I run 4.3 Paranoid Android on mine and it runs like butter. At $430 off contract with its specs and the ability to run whatever Rom you want it’s hard to pass up this phone. Sure it’s only snapdragon 600 vs the 800 on the N5 but it also has a removable battery and expandable storage and comes with 32 gb already built in and comes in indigo blue or white for color options </p>
<p> What would be even MORE interesting is if my Optimus Vu actually DOES get Kit Kat, being as it’s just at a year old but it’s still on ICS. </p>
<p> L9 isn’t even on the list. Lol, only the earlier L7 and L5. But they’ll probably be added later. </p>
<p> I have a Bauhn WL-101GQC (sold by Aldi in Australia) – it’s a 10.1 inch tablet with 3G phone capability and Android 4.1 – can I upgrade to KitKat? </p>
<p> Any info on the Optimus L9?! L3, L5, and L7 are weaker, so it’d make sense to update the L9 as well! </p>
<p> I have a Samsung galaxy S2 GT-I9100 and recently received the Android 4.1.2 JB update. I would like to know if my device will receive further updates. </p>
<p> Samsung had been working relentlessly on releasing updates for their phones, including the Galaxy S3. With such a diluted and extended market, updates take a long time especially when working with carries both in the United States and internationally. Odds are, an update for your phone is available but your carrier had yet to push it out. If you think it’s Samsung’s fault, I say go be a \loyal\ customer elsewhere. And purchasing one GSIII phone from Samsung doesn’t exactly make you loyal to begin with. </p>
<p> Motorola Droid RAZR M, still a great phone so I hope to see an update from 4.1.2, preferably to 4.4 since it supposedly will be able to run on low end Androids but I’m not gonna get my hope up since y’all didn’t list any Motorola devices </p>
<p> How about galaxy S3 mini? Will this handset got update android 4.4 kitkat too or at least android JB 4.3? </p>
<p> Dafuq they Said Android 4.4 will be there for every phone now what the hell ? No Note 1 and S2 Included in samsung list This is shit -_- </p>
<p> I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket which is essentially an early version of the S3. The S2 Skyrocket was only sold in the US. The 1.5 Ghz dual core processor is probably powerful enough to handle the Kitkat update, but I haven’t been able to find how much RAM is built into the phone. </p>
<p> I have the T-Mobile U.S. Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. I see both models listed which means I hope both will get the update soon. </p>
<p> I still can’t see a low end 512mb ram device which Google claimed KitKat to run smoothly on 🙁 </p>
<p> Samsung dont seem to be interested in those loyal customerswho brougth Galaxy S3. We are still stuck with 4.1.2 they have promised a jellybean 4.3.1 update but I dont think they will bring out for those with international Galaxy S3 so I hold no hope for an android KitKat 4.4 from the company with no loyalty to there Galaxy international S3 users. I am looking to upgrade and was considering the Galaxy S5 once released now I dont think samsung will be chosen. But sony or lg might be the prefered choice or even a windows phone due yo the lack of support for the S3. </p>
<p> My guess is you are on Verizon the fact you are stuck on 4.1.2 is Verizons fault not Samsungs Verizon restricts updates if they can’t put their controls into it to restrict certain actions so until they can do that you are held back. </p>
<p> What do you mean? Android 4.3 for Galaxy S3 International (i9300) is already out. What a waste of a rant. http://www.samfirmware.com </p>
<p> OMG, I can’t wait to buy new device to experience the new Android KitKat! nice post. </p>
<p> I own a google nexus 4, when google rolling out the Android KitKat 4.4 to nexus devices in INDIA. </p>
<p> GALAXY TAB 3 got update??? seriously ??? when ? please reply me… or send me an email about this </p>
<p> I have the Motorola Atrix HD running 4.1.1 will it be getting kit kat? I also have the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 running 4.2.2 will it be getting kit kat? Please let me know as soon as possible. Thanks!! </p>
<p> Will Gionee elife e3 get Kitkat update? If yes, then when could I expect the release? </p>
<p> i have a gionee elife e3 and a micromax canvas 2 plus so please tell me wheather the update will come or not..????? </p>
<p> I have Samsung Note (ie the first Note produced by Samsung) and it is now at Android 4.12. Will the Note get the Kit Kat 4.4 ? What about 4.2.2 or 4.3 ? </p>
<p> I own Samsung Galaxy S3 SHV-E210K (KOREAN VARIANT), just tell me when Android KitKat would release for my device… ^_^ </p>
<p> I’m not understanding the galaxy tab 2 and 3 are getting 4.4 and the galaxy note 8.0 isn’t getting this what the hell is that </p>
<p> I own Micromax Canvas 2 Plus(A110Q). Will there be any update 4.4 kitkat for this phone? </p>
<p> AOA : i have galaxy note3 N9005 when it may get kitkat 4.4 or will samsung update note 3 with kitkat </p>
<p> Nice work again… Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 sticks on 4.1.2 forever :/ ps. (will be my last sammy device. so disappointed in sammy) </p>
<p> mine is LG 4X HD , and unfortunately it’s not on the list !! I really wonder cause it’s configuration is exactly the same as VU and a lot better tahn L series and was LG’s flagship at the time of announcement. I’m dreaming of having 4.4 on it !!! </p>
<p> I have the original Samsung Galaxy Note. Hoping for the update since the last update has major issues. </p>
<p> According to this List, it will not be provided for my phone. I wish that if KitKat will come for L3, L5, L7, then there should be no problem in releasing it for the Top phone of the Optimus Series, i.e L9. </p>
<p> I own a Samsung Galaxy S GT-i9000. Will it be getting 4.4? I ask because it seems soms older phones will be getting this update. </p>
<p> Dude I own an L3. But is this news true? I mean, is it for only L Series II devices, like L3 II etc. I don’t think L3 will get it. It is an obsolete device. But maybe I’m wrong…:P </p>
<p> i got Optimus Vu here, but which one is the one above? </p>
<p> Optimus vu got lot of varian </p>
<p> Vu F100L/S (this is mine and korean version) Vu P895 international one VU II F200L VU III </p>
<p> hi, I have LG optimus 4x hd , it’s really a nice high-tech phone, but I don’t know why it’s still stuck at 4.1 version. could you please tell me whether LG gonna update this time. thanks, gurlove. </p>
<p> Why didn’t you mention about the rest of Nexus devices? You wrote about LG Nexus 4 but what about Nexus 7, Nexus 10? They will definitely get this update. And what about older devices like Galaxy Nexus? </p>
<p> I wish if they bring the update to the ZR. I’ll be the first one to buy. Too large screen sizes suck 😐 </p>
<p> I am using XoloQ1000 Phone. My query is will i update this Kit kat version(4.4) & is xolo Q1000 compatible with OTG cable. </p>
<p> is itbdefinate that the galaxy note II will get the kit kat update? just curious coz m stuck at version 4.1.2 </p>
<p> Nothing is definite for now, but its happened earlier that the companies skip the few next updates to bring out a major update for the high-end devices, thus don’t be surprised if 4.4 update is sent to your Note 3. </p>
<p> I have LG optimus hub [e510] . Please let me know if my device is getting an 4.4 update. </p>
<p> Hi, Any news for update Lenovo K900. I have purchase this smartphone, So please tell me. </p>
<p> We will keep you posted once we get to hear about 4.4 for your device. Do stay tuned to AndroidAdvices </p>
<p> And what about Samsung Galaxy s2 in india? Actually atleast we s2 users want this update whether samsung will give Kie lime pi or not… PLEASE.. </p>
<p> Hey what about micromax canvas 4 A210??? Does it will be gifted with kitkat or not??? </p>
<p> Happy To Know That My Note II Will Be Getting The Update. Especially After Being Stuck At v4.1.2 For So Long. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> List of Phones which will get Ice Cream Sandwich Update </p>
<p> It’s not too old news that Google has now officially unveiled the Ice Cream Sandwich i.e., Android 4.0 along with the launch of Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Thanks to the new Android OS version that may users keep on asking whether this update is available for their phone and if yes when it will arrive? The Asus came up with an announcement that their Padfone would come with Android 4.0 and it would be available in January 2012. That would be the near time when the Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) would be made available for update on existing phones. </p>
<p> The following are the Android handsets which we think should be able to run the Ice Cream Sandwich update better and provide a better experience. We are not sure when these phones would receive the official firmware update but they are the front contenders for the Ice Cream Sandwich update first. </p>
<p> Samsung Nexus S </p>
<p> When the Samsung Galaxy Nexus debuts with Ice Cream Sandwich then why not its predecessor mobile phone? If you are expecting Ice Cream Sandwich update on existing phones then Nexus S is prime contender because it is the phone to start testing ICS. </p>
<p> Probably, when the Galaxy Nexus is available by November 1, the ICS update for Nexus S should be taking it shape slated to be released soon. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S II </p>
<p> The next phone which will get the Ice Cream Sandwich update is the Galaxy S II phone by Samsung Electronics. Galaxy S II is powerful phone with dual core 1.2 Ghz processor and impressive specifications to runs the Ice Cream Sandwich OS update smoothly. Already we have spotted Galaxy S II in China coming with NFC so there would be no problem & easily compatibility for Ice Cream Sandwich on S II phone. </p>
<p> Motorola Droid Razr </p>
<p> The Droid Razr by Motorola was launched just 12 hours earlier than the Galaxy Nexus launch and boards almost same specifications. Motorola team has already announced it that Droid Razr will be out with Ice Cream Sandwich soon and maybe they are playing with smart moves to keep in check with Samsung. </p>
<p> Droid Razr has got the right hardware but lacks Galaxy Nexus for most part of important update of NFC and Android Beam which one of the highlighting feature of Ice Cream Sandwich. </p>
<p> Motorola Atrix 2 </p>
<p> The Motorola Atrix 2 dual core 4G phone should be the next phone in the Motorola line up to receive the Ice Cream Sandwich update but it would be maybe by January next year the update of Ice Cream Sandwich is to be available on it. </p>
<p> Motorola Droid Bionic </p>
<p> The Motorola Droid Bionic with dual core 1 Ghz ARM Cortex A9 processor and OMAP chipset should be the next range of Android phone which would receive the Android update to 4.0. Motorola changed the chipset from Tegra to OMAP in order to pursuit the LTE and ICS in the near phone on this phone. Maybe it would be the first choice of device to receive the ICS update as Razr and Atrix 2 among the Motorola phones are the prime contenders for ICS update. </p>
<p> HTC Amaze 4G </p>
<p> The HTC Amaze 4G truly deserves the name as it has pretty decent software and has an amazing camera too. Also the hardware with which its built has killer specifications and chances that ICS would first come to HTC Amaze 4G when you talk about HTC phones to go with. </p>
<p> Since there is no official announcement which mobiles would receive the Ice Cream Sandwich, users are expecting too much, maybe but I would say let the Ice Cream Sandwich to be launched and then think about updates. For those who are unable to judge whether there mobile is upgradeable to Android 4.0 update, check back our blog. </p>
<p> The following are the few others mobile phones which might receive the Android 4.0 updates are LG Optimus 3D, Motorola Photo 4G, Motorola Atrix 4G, Samsung Droid Charge, myTouch 4G Slide. </p>
<p> Some of the phones launched in 2011 will get update and more won’t but its clear that high-end phones which would be announced from now should include Ice Cream Sandwich as the minimum operating system. Importantly we would see more custom ROM coming up which are built with modifications over the ICS. </p>

<p> A whole lot of folks overlook the initial crucial steps, just like producing certain you have got a wonderful </p>
<p> i found your blog these days and that i read many incredible articles appropriate here. </p>
<p> I HAVE GALAXY MINI I M VERY MUCH CONFUSION ABOUT UPDATE AVAILIBILITY OF ICS 4.0.3… PLEASE ADVICE…. ME… </p>
<p> VERY disappointed that Motorola Droid Pro isn’t on the upgrade list. I just got the phone and I love it, but was hoping an update was coming that would correct the DHCP internet connectivity problems associated with Gingerbread. </p>
<p> yes it will soon be getting, though the beta version is already covered on androidadvices! </p>
<p> Any chance Galaxy GIO might be capable? In at least a minimized version perhaps? An update for GIO’s would be really nice 😀 as they are still relatively new. </p>
<p> Galaxy Ace is a cheap and crappy low specs phone which doesn’t deserve to be upgraded to ICS, I hope no ICS updates will be released… 🙂 </p>
<p> You can checkk out the table on androidadvices.com for the ICS update availability. </p>
<p> Yes, it will come for Galaxy S2, keep checking, we will update with the procedure for the same once it arrives. </p>
<p> What about Samsung Galaxy SL (I-9003) , will this get 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich or not . Please reply </p>
<p> do you think samsung (FIT,and samsung ACE) will be upgraded to version 4(android-ice-cream-sandwich. </p>
<p> there is no info on the same, mostly they wont get updated but you never know if any developer optimizes the same! officially it wont get! </p>
<p> What about Sony xperia series phones.will sony 2011 xperia series will get ice cream or sandwich or not? </p>
<p> Very skeptical about U.S. Galaxy SII. Samsung Italy said yes to European Galaxy S II in 2012 though. But the original U.S. Galaxy S models on the major carriers still have yet to receive Gingerbread! Samsung and U.S. business is always at odds and this is thanks to Apple. </p>
<p> Maybe, but the Samsung penetration in other countries is very good. And unofficial update of Galaxy S are available. </p>
<p> In the written above, it says that (((((“Galaxy S2 (GTI-9100)”))))) the first S2 phone is one of the has opportunities to upgrade to ICS, i mean which Galaxy S2 phone is going to upgrade to ICS. </p>
<p> my phone is (((((“Galaxy S2 (GTI-9100)”))))), is it going to have the upgrade or not??????? </p>
<p> thank you, please give me the simplest and clearest answer </p>
<p> WOW samsung galaxy s2 will also get ICS ? That’s cool i want to buy it . It will be great for me as nexus and other are out of my budget </p>
<p> The reason check it out here -http://androidadvices.com/upgrade-android-mobile-ice-cream-sandwich/ </p>
<p> Do you think the Galaxy S will receive this update? of course only if it runs smoothly…. </p>
<p> surely its received yaar.. cause its an international version of galaxy s series phone and google also promise to support atleat 18 months so.. </p>

<p> Meet the best & new Live Video Streaming App, “Meerkat” for Android – Download Now </p>
<p> Meet the pioneers of Live Video Streaming, yes we are talking about the “Meerkat” android app. For all those who wanted to know what exactly Meerkat does is that it enables you to broadcast the Live video to everyone on internet with the help of your twitter account. Meerkat is first of a kind of video streaming app which debuted in Southwest, Texas in 2015. This one is way better than the likes of Livestream. This service was earlier available in a closed environment which accepted only beta testers in a closed programs and now it’s all available for everyone in Google Play Store. </p>
<p> How Meerkat Works? Download Meerkat app from Google Play Store and link your twitter account after which it will publish a tweet from your profile to public to alert that you are broadcasting something live to the World. Accordingly, Meerkat also allows you to view the other streams as well. This one also gives you the instant feedback from users as well through the likes and comments on Live video. Broadcasters can also measure the stream likes and other metrics to calculate the success of the stream. </p>
<p> The only disadvantage of Meerkat as of now is that it doesn’t allow users to save / download the stream which may be available to the paid users going down the line. While this app is available for download in public, this app still comes with the beta tag. </p>
<p> Do try this one out and let us know on whether you liked it or not. There is a similar service which twitter has launched recently which is dubbed as #Periscope which we will be checking out very soon. In Meerkat, twitter has strategically denied access to whole friends circle which Periscope enjoys as it’s officially of twitter. We will very soon check out in detail about Periscope as well which has better interaction capabilities when compared with Meerkat. </p>

<p> Try different Locker Screens on your Android Phone with GO Locker App </p>
<p> There exists so many Lock screen application for your mobile phone on Android. Until now the WidgetLocker Android application previously dominated as the best third party lock screen button. The Go Locker application comes from the team of Go Dev which has developed lot many applications such as Go SMS and Go Launcher. </p>
<p> Since GO Locker is dedicated towards customization and design just like other applications intended for the purpose of the locking screen but sad to see this application pressing you with less attention to it. It gives you the basic list of options which are enabling the security lock and changing the background wallpapers. There are few more under the hood but those are not enough to make this application perfect one. </p>
<p> We just love the locking interface and it was quite amazing. To run this application you also need to have Go Launcher EX as this application willn’t run without it. </p>
<p> As soon as you install this application on your mobile phone and run it through, you will see the home screen. </p>
<p> There is nothing much in the home screen as it will show you only the paid themes which can be downloaded from Android Play Store. Click on them it will take you to the Play Store. These themes are price well over $ 2. </p>
<p> You will find all things required to you at Settings link page. Tap on it. </p>
<p> The first option in Settings is the Go Locker Enable. </p>
<p> The next option is the background image settings. When you click on the background you have few options for selection which includes the launcher background, custom background, GoLocker background and the default background. </p>
<p> Various lock screen effects are available to choose from Zoom, Windmill, TV, Flip, Random and Random custom. </p>
<p> Users can also set full screen lock as well. Just tick it if you want. </p>
<p> If users want to modify how the date and time will look, then can directly do it here instead of going through the stock Android time and date settings. </p>
<p> The next are the settings of security like security lock, lock home key and the emergency lock. </p>
<p> Emergency lock is especially something which I should talk about it here. When you setup security lock, if you can remember the password or pattern to unlock you can long press on the volume button to unlock the screen. </p>
<p> The security lock options allow you to setup the pin lock, pattern lock, gesture lock. And this will show after when you pull down the Go Locker lock screen. </p>
<p> Go Locker Android App Download </p>
<p> Go Locker Android application can be easily downloaded from Android Apps Labs for free. To download it directly on to your mobile phone, you need to visit the Android Apps Labs page listing of the Go Locker and then click on the install to automatically proceed with the installation. </p>
<p> Alternatively one can easily download it on their mobile phone using the below Bar code. You need to open the bar code scanning application on your mobile phone and then place the camera to this square. </p>
<p> Verdict </p>
<p> The Go Locker is just a good application with great potential but the fact that you need to purchase the paid themes to make it more intuitive hurts users. We expect drastic improvements expectation before it should be considered. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> LogMeIn Ignition Comes to Android </p>
<p> One of the most powerful apps that I really fell in love with when using an iPhone was LogMeIn. LogMeIn allows users to remotely access their computer from anywhere. While it may be hard to comprehend at first – it actually brings up your desktop onto your phone and gives you pretty much full control over your computer. In fact I have read stories about people who have had the server installed on their computer and the client installed on their phone and then had their computer stolen. LogMeIn allowed the actual owner of the computer to dig up enough information on the thief to get their computer back. It is literally that powerful. Although this is not the only use that LogMeIn has – it is a nice little security measure. </p>
<p> LogMeIn was initially an iPhone app that sold for around thirty dollars on the iTunes Store. Now it has come to Android and it is already making waves. As of writing this the Android version is still in beta – however, this is unlikely to last long because it seems like it is about ready to go. I played around with it and it seems every bit as stable as the iPhone version. There are also very limited downloads available and it is only available to people in certain countries – so get in while you can if you are an American, Australian, Brit or New Zealander (these are the main countries where it is available at present – I believe there are a few others however). It is actually a fairly responsive remote access tool. </p>
<p> Once you download the app you will need to make an account on the LogMeIn website and also install a server on your computer. The whole process takes about ten minutes and then you can start playing around with it. It affords you quite a great deal of control over your computer and it is pretty easy to use. Most of the major functions that you are likely to use when using your computer are easily done via keyboard shortcuts on your Android device (things such as right click, ALT+Tab and Ctrl+Alt+Delete are all there). You can view your documents by opening them up with Word or OpenOffice pretty easily too – you can even edit them. Although this isn’t really recommended as it is a little jerky because it all is done via an internet connection. </p>
<p> I am not sure when the beta ends (I assume soon however) and once it hits the Market then it will probably cost around the same as the iPhone equivalent. However this is a one off purchase cost and you won’t have a recurring fee to pay each month so it is really thirty dollars well spent. It is pretty easy to use so you won’t have a massively steep learning curve – that said you will have to learn how to operate the software. It is handy for people who need access to their computer while out and about and don’t really want to worry about having an FTP client installed on their phone. </p>

<p> Sir the download link for s4 i9505 in not working can u provide other link for me the link you given says that file do not exist. </p>
<p> All I was telling you is that your instructions require a .tar file and that is not there; so either put the .tar file in the download, or change your instructions so that people understand how to load a .zip file on Galaxy S4. </p>
<p> The file(s) you offer for download are simple .zip files… the instructions you provide are for .tar file! Please make up your mind and publish a correction soonest…you are confusing a lot of people with this! </p>
<p> Can we receive the Google edition over the air update on our gt-i9505. If we was to install this ROM. </p>
<p> Once you download these files,and extract them there are no tar files. hence you would need to load them on to your phone via a custom recovery, such as TWRP, or Clockworkmod Recovery. you can only do this if your phone is rooted. Unfortunately with the update that went out from AT&T in the last couple of days ,that would be nearly impossiable. </p>

<p> After hours I found the v2.0 Maximus rom that was released. It initially installed fine but my wifi, 4g, and cellular networks all weren’t connecting. Said screw it, wiped everything again, adb pushed the rom back to my phone.. and it just keeps getting stuck on the HTC quietly brilliant screen/ Over and over and over again. I can’t get past it. Anyone, any advice? </p>
<p> I followed the steps and unlocked the bootloader and rooted my device. That went fine. Then I downloaded the Maximus rom file and transferred it to my phone’s internal HDD. Entered TWRP, factory restore, wipe system data, cache, and delvik. Clicked install and chose the .zip that’s the maximus rom. I select full wipe and within the first second it starts installing, it gives me the </p>
<p> error. I let it wait 30 minutes with no change to the status. I’ve been without my phone for almost a whole day now and I CANNOT get this thing to work. I can’t even find a stock rom to restore it to its factory condition. Can anyone out there help? I’m close to slamming this thing against the wall. </p>

<p> Hey Deepak, we will surely come up with the detailed guide which will help you install Lollipop even on Moto E </p>
<p> I have a Motorola G (2nd generation) and whenever I check for updates it tells me I have the latest version (Android 4.4). Do I wait for it? Mine should be getting the update </p>
<p> you should get an update in few days or your device might have already got the update </p>
<p> i have the xt1063 global SINGLE SIM version. Followed all the steps, get “installation aborted” error. Help </p>
<p> Its hard-tried it so many times. When is the moto X 2013 going to be offiocially uodated to lollipop ? There shouldnt be too much delay actually. </p>
<p> it doesn’t work it goes on about something and says installation aborted can reboot normally after failed update but update doesn’t work help! (have xt1063) (device is unlocked had custom recovery but restored stock recovery) </p>
<p> I have Moto G (2nd edition) bought in USA but Global unlocked version. I am now in Europe and have seen that the official update is available from today, but when I go to settings I get a message that I already have the latest software, but it is 4.4.4. So, my question is should I wait, or should I update manually and if yes is this the right software because I do not have dual sim version. Thank. </p>
<p> I have the same issue as you. I have the global xt1063 and it says im already running the newest software. Mine currently runs on 4.4.4. have you flashed the zip file of Lollipop in yet? </p>
<p> I have the same problem! I have xt1063 and when i click system update it says im running on the newest software. How do I get lollipop? 🙁 I bought it from the US and im in Pakistan </p>
<p> Motorola is releasing the Android 5.0 upgrade in batches because if they release it to everyone at once their servers will probably crash. So, you will get Lollipop along with everyone from your batch. </p>
<p> nevermind, works great, if you get to the dead android screen press power and volume again to get the recovery options mentioned above. Thanks Pradeep! </p>
<p> Also on the 2nd gen moto g the up volume button is the select key, not the power button, at least on the us version… </p>
<p> not working for me, once I reboot into recovery I just get a dead android on his back with the words No Command. I have already unlocked the bootloader if that makes a difference… </p>
<p> I’m looking to update my Moto G2 to Lollipop version but wasn’t sure how to go about it. And I find your article at the right time. I’ll follow your mentioned steps to proceed further. </p>

So let’s check out on what are the quick pre requisites which you need to follow before we slip into the detailed guide which will help you update the device. </p>
<p> Note: Applying this update won’t void the warranty or root the device in any manner as this is the official firmware update by Motorola which is being soak tested. </p>
<p> Quick Pre Requisites: </p>
<p> Create a manual backup of all the data with the help of below mentioned steps and not with any automated desktop tools as it may or may not help you restore the data. We recommend you t create the backup with below steps. </p>
<p> SMS – Use “SMS Backup & Restore app”, Contacts – Sync with the Gmail application, Call Log – Call Log and Restore Images, Songs, Videos, Files – Copy to internal / External SD Card, APN and MMS Settings – Note down from the path “Applications > Settings > Wireless and Network > Mobile Networks > Access Point Names” </p>
<p> After creating the backup, move all the backup files to your desktop. </p>
<p> Navigate to “Settings > Developer Options > USB Debugging” to enable the same in your Moto E. Just in case if you can’t see the Developer Options, head over to the “About Phone” to tap on the “Build Number” multiple times till the Developer mode doesn’t get enabled </p>
<p> Battery left in your Moto E should be a minimum of 60%. </p>
<p> Let’s proceed to the next step where we have detailed the instructions for applying this update. </p>
<p> Procedure to Manual Update Moto E with Lollipop 5.0.2 Android OS: </p>
<p> All the apps in your device should be updated via Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Make sure that the file name is “Blur_Version.21.12.40.condor_retaildsds.retaildsdsall.en.03.zip“ and is placed in the root directory itself rather than placing in some folder preferably in the external SD card. </p>
<p> Now, disconnect the device from computer and navigate to “Settings” to tap on the “Check for Update” to get the update notification. Once done, you just need to follow the onscreen instructions for applying the update. </p>
<p> Note: In a rare case if you get the notification that your device is on the latest version, just boot your device in the stock recovery and then select wipe cache partition for clearing the cache partition. (Recovery mode in moto E can be entered by pressing the Volume Up + Volume Down and then holding these both keys, turn ON the device). </p>
<p> So there you go, you have now successfully updated the device with the latest version of Lollipop 5.0.2 Android OS. Do let us know in the comments section just in case if you face any issues in the process of firmware update. </p>

<p> what if the Nexus 4 is stuck in the boot loop and USB Debugging Mode is not enabled ? How do you enable it ? </p>
<p> Is manual download the last thing coming or is there a direct Lollipop on the way? </p>
<p> If I have cwm or twrp do I have to go back to stock? can I flash back the stock .img from 4.4? and then do the 5.0 update? </p>

<p> Microsoft Band is a $199 fitness tracker compatible with Android – Details </p>
<p> Microsoft unveiled its first major wearable fitness device yesterday called “Microsoft Band.” It also introduced a new health platform to go with the Band, called Microsoft Health. The Microsoft Band went on sale today across retail and online stores for $199. Microsoft Band also works with Android smartphones via a free, downloadable app called Microsoft Health, which is available in the Play Store. It’ll work with any Bluetooth LE device running Windows Phone 8.1 Update, iOS 7.1 or newer on an iPhone 4S or newer, and Android 4.3 or newer. </p>
<p> While primarily focused on health and fitness tracking, the Microsoft Band also includes a number of smart watch features, including getting alerts for in-coming calls, messages, social media updates and email. Microsoft band is made of a “thermal plastic elastomer”. It got a tiny 1.4-inch touchscreen at just 320 x 106 pixels resolution and is powered by two 100mAh lithium-ion batteries. The charge time is 1.5 hours, using a magnetically attached USB charger. There are three different sizes, so it should fit on most wrists. </p>

<p> Download Microsoft Bing App for Android – Gets a Facelift with better Navigation, Search and More </p>
<p> Microsoft and Google are no where related but the former doesn’t stop from attempting in bringing out stuff that even the Google Android users might love. The Bing App for Android from Microsoft has got a major update and they have come up with a far more beautiful design for the app, and it looks quite similar to the desktop website version of Bing. </p>
<p> The app isn’t limited to only search, because the Bing App has got different sections, where you can directly check for the weather conditions, search with voice, connect with your Microsoft and Facebook accounts and enhance the user experience and also, use it as a widget just like the Google search widget where the voice search can be done. The integrated browser which doesn’t look any different than the Internet Explorer, would open the Bing Maps for you to search for locations and directions. </p>
<p> The popular section has the bing trends where the daily images and the other trending topics in the search and news are being flown around. Weather is just the direct search for the particular location, but you can set it to show the weather for your current location. There are a lot of settings, where you can opt to use the Private mode, and the searches won’t be saved for your account or in the device, and the search results can be set to open in the system browser if you set it that way. </p>
<p> If it was just the search, then Bing wouldn’t have received any appreciation, but here it is a module with different features. Facebook connection would let you share the results, photos and content from the Bing app to your Facebook account directly. You can even take snapshots of the search pages and these would be stored directly in the Skydrive account of yours. We also liked the daily image on the app which you can directly use as a wallpaper for your smartphone, thus the search for a perfect wallpaper ends. </p>
<p> The Metro interface that we see in the Windows Phone and Windows 8 OS, is quite a bit replicated here and it does look very neat. Although one might argue whether there is a need to use a separate search engine when Google is doing its job in every Android device around, this app is well worth a try, if you stop thinking about the makers. </p>
<p> It’s a free app and you can install it from the Play Store: Link </p>

<p> How To Mirror Android Screen on Chromecast / Apple TV via Nexus 5 </p>
<p> Cyanogen team’s Koushik Dutta has been one active user who has been working on the different things for the Chromecast, and after a few weeks of teasing of the Mirroring of the Android screen, he is able to get it to work on the Nexus 5 smartphone whose screen can be mirrored to the Chromecast. The Mirror for Android beta is now getting an update where the users would now be able to mirror the smartphone screen to the Chrome browser or to the Chromecast. </p>
<p> On the Google Plus page, Dutta said: </p>
<p> So, I updated the Mirror beta on the play store to include the Chrome and Chromecast mirroring. (v1.0.0.8, will take a bit to roll out) </p>
<p> Chromecast support is super beta. Only works on Nexus 5. This is because Nexus 5 is the only phone on the market that has a hardware vp8 encoder. </p>
<p> At some point I’ll get Mirror wrapped up for a proper Play store release. Got a bunch of other stuff I need to fix first. </p>
<p> Now, talking about the Mirror for Android app, here is what it would be able to do. </p>
<p> Create a video recording of your Android (was a feature included in Android KitKat, but none could do it) </p>
<p> Mirror your Android screen to Chromecast (Nexus 5 only) </p>
<p> Mirror your Android Screen to Chrome browser (Nexus 5 only) </p>
<p> Mirror your Android screen to an Apple TV </p>
<p> So using the Mirror for Android app, you could just show the screen directly to the larger TVs with the Chromecast without any other connection required. The Chromecast streaming earlier was limited to only a few apps like Youtube, Netflix etc. but at least for now, the Nexus 5 is a device which can be used to do a lot more than you expect. </p>
<p> Head over to the Google Plus community for the ClockworkMod and join it to try out the new feature. Do keep in mind that you will need to root your Root your Android 4.4.2 Nexus 5. [Check out the ChromeCast FAQ] </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Mobo Live – Highly Customizable App Launcher with Widgets, Managers & Themes </p>
<p> When you talk of any good launchers, most of them would like the inspired ones and the only ones which are very well known around, having millions of users are the Hi Launcher, the Action Launcher Pro and a few others. To add to that, there is a very refreshed launcher called Mobo Live, a perfect one for those who wanted to have a totally refreshed look for their device, instead of hitting the head hard for installing a custom ROM in the device. </p>
<p> The Mobo Live app comes with loads of options, themes and new icons, widgets which all change the user experience for someone who is using the same interface in their Android phone since a long time. I’m using a Gionee Elife E6 and a Nexus 5 from Google, and both these devices have got totally different interfaces, where the Elife E6 comes with the Amigo interface, while its the Stock ROM with a very simple and easy to use interface in the Nexus 5. I wanted to have a common type of interface which was easily possible through a launcher, and Mobo Live is quite impressive. </p>
<p> Some of the features that one would easily love about the Mobo Live launcher for Android would be: </p>
<p> Customized and customizable icons for many apps, and you can use their Desk migrate feature to migrate the icons to its own launcher </p>
<p> A huge list of websites on a dedicated page for search, and that includes the Voice search </p>
<p> Option to hide apps from the app drawer </p>
<p> Transition effects, which are mostly seen in the different launchers but these are still always good </p>
<p> Wallpapers, themes to make a facelift to every page </p>
<p> Phone management via different widgets – RAM Booster, Battery widget </p>
<p> Easy access to the frequently used and recently installed applications </p>
<p> Backup & Restore of Apps – Removes the need for a dedicated app for this </p>
<p> Battery life optimizer to extend the battery life, which in fact works quite well </p>
<p> There is a lot more, but we could argue that some of them are available in the other launchers as well, but what’s special is all listed below in the screenshots. The Mobo Live is seriously going to make a big overhaul to the way your home screen, app drawer and the widgets look. </p>
<p> The initial opening of the launcher would show you all the tips to make it easier for the user to get things done. There’s a question mark which on tapping would show the various tips and tricks or swiping, dragging and making the usage easier. </p>
<p> There is a direct access to the Recently installed applications and even the recently used applications. The Ram Booster is pretty helpful in managing the RAM and just a tap on that would free some RAM by shutting down the unnecessary applications. </p>
<p> The dedicated search page with a whole big list of important sites is not just good, but more than that because one can easily change the details and that includes the voice search. Downloading themes won’t be any hard, because Mobo Live has its own separate section to choose and download the themes, and thus, lesser load when actually installing the Mobo Live initially. You can choose and download any theme later on. Adding the app shortcuts is easier as you can just select it and take it to the home screen which shows in the bottom dock while you have selected it. </p>
<p> Drag down from Home screen: It would show up the Quick settings panel, and that includes a lot of quick settings, which actually would be available if you pull down the notification panel too, but that’s not the case in every Android smartphone. There are settings for the ring modes, connectivity options, and the network settings, Alarm, Apps, Ringtone etc. The extra options include the brightness setting, ringtone setting, media setting, notification volume setting. </p>
<p> Drag up from Home screen: This would show up another list of options, and this mostly include the personalization options like the Wallpapers, Themes, Effects, Preferences, Download manager and a shortcut to open all settings. The good thing is you don’t have to run around to find some good wallpapers as the app itself comes with a few good ones. Also, the settings page would let you know whether the phone is rooted or not, so again replaces the need for another app – Root checker. </p>
<p> The home screen looks lively with the weather widget which shows not just the weather information, but also the date and time, and there is a lot of flexibility as the users can choose the size based on their need. Multiple home screens can be added and removed and things are easy to play around with. </p>
<p> Apart from what we shared above, there are some very useful features such as the One-tap power saving and the search function inclusion in the preferences area. </p>
<p> Do we recommend the Mobo Live as one of the best launcher apps for Android? Yes! But why? </p>
<p> First, it’s a free one and doesn’t have any real needed purchases from within the app </p>
<p> Colorful and easy to use UI with themes and wallpapers </p>
<p> Dragging options to expose quick settings and personalization options </p>
<p> Smooth transitions with the different animations when scrolling between app drawer pages </p>
<p> For Gionee users: The Amigo UI doesn’t have an app drawer at all. This one brings the app drawer back for those who were missing it </p>
<p> Phone manager, Battery and RAM manager which makes it easy to save battery and make the phone faster in performance </p>
<p> There is launcher named 360 launcher which has quite a lot of similarities but the problem with that is, you won’t be able to see all the features in the same launcher and there are different apps to be installed to access everything well. Also, although the 360 launcher is customizable, we would rate Mobo Live to be better than this because the customization is possible to the next level, and when you get to see so much in the interface, the customization would allow you to make it far better. There are two good reasons to call Mobo Live a winner here: </p>
<p> Manager Section </p>
<p> The manager section is what would make the performance of the phone better, and keep the data in the smartphone safe. There are some handy tools in the Manager section located in the app drawer, and these include: </p>
<p> Security: Warns about the risky apps, which have permissions for “pay for the service” or to access the personal info. It also has the section for suspicious apps, as well as the startup apps which would run as soon as the smartphone starts up after a reboot. You can set any permissions to them. </p>
<p> Cleaner: Tapping a single button would clean the phone with the unnecessary apps stopped, and junk files cleared. Things can be changed in the notification bar, and the user can disable the startup apps, as well as clean the APK files </p>
<p> Backup: The launcher would help the user take a backup of the applications or the personal data </p>
<p> Battery: There is a good battery optimizer included to enhance the battery life of the smartphone by optimizing the settings </p>
<p> App Manager </p>
<p> Website Navigation </p>
<p> The website navigation section has loads of important websites listed just like bookmarks, but you don’t need to do that manually as the launcher has the list of the best websites in the different categories from Entertainment to Shipment Delivery, and one can easily go to that by going to the extreme left home screen. You can choose to show the spotlight search and websites, or to hide them. These two features do make it a better choice than the several other launchers, which are merely the ones for the interface changes but not for the optimization of the smartphone along with the personalization. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> MoboMarket 3.0 Released with Improved Geo-location and App Recommendations </p>
<p> There are several Google Play Store alternatives available right now, and choosing the best one in them is always a task. One of those recommended apps is MoboMarket, which has a vast database of applications that can be downloaded without having to use the Play Store. MoboRobo, the developer of MoboMarket has just released the v3.0 of MoboMarket application, and it comes with several good improvements to the already present features. </p>
<p> MoboMarket is an app store for Android phones, with the advantage being that it is a third party store and it doesn’t require any permissions or payment options and can be installed on any Android smartphone. This app has been there in the Android ecosystem since the past two years, and since its introduction, has been able to garner over 100 million users worldwide. The daily distribution of Mobomarket is about 40 million, and there are about 5 million daily active users. Having users mainly from North America, South EastAsia, Middle East, North Africa, the Mobomarket app has its own free and secure host for Android app resources. </p>
<p> The changes that you get to see in the MoboMarket 3.0, include the following. </p>
<p> Improved Geo-location & content pushing system that helps Android users discover the most popular Apps nearby based on location </p>
<p> More intuitive and smoother interface with a new look </p>
<p> User interest-based search & recommendation system. </p>
<p> Apart from the updates, the already present features include app updates from within the marketplace, download queue and smart installation where it doesn’t ask for your permission before installing the app, performance manager where RAM booster and startup optimizer features help in making the performance of the smartphone better, and an app manager helps in transferring the app from internal storage to SD card and vice-versa. The MoboMarket also features the PC connection options, and there’s an Android cleaner that cleans the unwanted files from the Android file system. </p>
<p> One of the advantages for the Android users, is that the same version of MoboMarket supports smartphones which run even the old Android 1.6 version, and all the versions later to it. Many of the Chinese smartphones do not come with Play Store and some do not allow it, although they run Android OS, and there, the MoboMarket is one of the most recommended app markets for downloading the applications, and it does have a large app repository. </p>
<p> Just like for the users, the MoboMarket platform is useful for developers as well, because the apps that are made and published to MoboMarket, are promoted and featured to get the users to download them, thus making it a win-win situation for both, the users and the app developers, as the revenue potential goes higher with the high-value users downloading the apps submitted by the developers. </p>
<p> To install the MoboMarket app on your Android smartphone, you need to either go to the website and download the .apk file, or scan the barcode given here. Since this is an .apk file, it will be identified as an external app in your phone, and thus, you need to go to Settings > Security and allow the external app installation to install the MoboMarket app. </p>

<p> MoboMarket Lite Review – Perfect Alternative to Google Play Store for Android </p>
<p> The Google Play Store might be quite enough for many to use, but you need to realize that not every Android smartphone has the Play store and most of the time, this store doesn’t serve the purpose and people would look for an alternative, and that is where the MoboMarket comes into the scene. The MoboMarket Lite is a pretty simple and very easy to use alternative to the Play Store, and could become a primary App store for your Android smartphone. </p>
<p> Getting into the details, the MoboMarket is something that would give you an easy interface with the various apps listed in list view, and you would be able to see the apps under Featured, Must Have, Hot and the Latest app categories, and there are some excellent apps to check out and download if you are looking for something which was once your favorite, but now not a part of the Google Play Store. Yes I’m talking about the apps like Flappy Bird and others which are not available on the Play Store now, but through the MoboMarket app, it’s simply all available there. </p>
<p> The featured apps list would show some of the featured apps on the top with huge icons, but scrolling down would expose a lot of other featured ones, and we did like the ones listed there because a few apps which we could see include MX Player, Antivirus apps, Adobe AIR, Skype etc. and the games are listed separately so the user doesn’t really have to go through the big lists if they wanted to download some interesting games. </p>
<p> The games in MoboMarket Lite are listed based on the rankings, and again under that, you see them based on the time, languages, categories of the games and the trending games. Searching for the app with a keyword would list the apps which come with the combined ratings and number of downloads to give the most relevant apps in the list. The settings section really doesn’t have much in it, but the details are quite enough for the user to understand how advantageous the MoboMarket app would be – especially with the Internal and SD card storage available. </p>
<p> The same section would show the number of apps which are updatable and the ones which are downloaded and installed. The updatable app count would even be shown in the notification panel on timely basis, and you can just swipe if you wished to download and update the apps later. There you go, no hassle of automatic update when you are on slow networks. </p>
<p> When you click on the app, the details page is quite good on detailing everything in an organized way, where the version, number of downloads, ratings and the language of the app stays above the screenshots, and this is followed by the description and comments on the app. In the bottom, you would get to see the download option. Another good thing about the MoboMarket Lite is that you can pause any app download and resume it later, rather than canceling it if at all you feel there’s no proper speed to download the app right away. </p>
<p> The app even has the themes and wallpapers, if you are someone who is using the Mobo Live Launcher in your Android device, so you won’t have to browse around searching for some neat looking options. </p>
<p> Couple of other things to notice about this app, include: </p>
<p> Apps based on Interest – There would be apps suggested by the market, based on the interest of the user and the other apps installed in the phone </p>
<p> Daily updated list of the best and trending apps in the market </p>
<p> Overall, this MoboMarket Lite is as the name suggests, a very light app which does more than what you expect – provide you a platform to search and download apps in an easier way with options like bulk installation, pausing the download and more. For the users who always had an issue with the Play Store for reasons including the Google account, auto updates over Wi-Fi (which can be turned off though) or anything other than this, the MoboMarket Lite is a perfect alternative for that. It is available for free on the Google Play Store, and the size of just 1.9MB doesn’t hurt your device much. </p>
<p> 3 Comments </p>
<p> I really appreciate you for all the valuable information that you are providing through your blog. This time is a new alternative place to the android market. </p>
<p> not every Android smartphone has the Play store???? Never seen a android without the play store ….. even the earliest Androids had a app store called as ‘Market’ (and I am talking about the time when G1 was launched around 2008, and when Samsung’s initially launched the galaxy series, the I-7500 and the I-5700 in 2009) which was later renamed to Play Store. I would really like to know about the android device that doesn’t come with the play store pre-installed. And I am not talking about the upcoming Nokia X series cause they are not really true Androids, but a mimic. </p>

<p> Mobo Portal from MoboRobo – Easily Copy Text from PC to Android Device </p>
<p> We’ve earlier recommended and talked about the MoboRobo software which does a good job of syncing and getting a lot of things done between the Android device and the computer. The compatibility doesn’t end with just the Android but also the iOS devices, and this is one of the very stable and decent software which makes it possible to manage a lot of stuff that includes the apps, messages, files and almost everything on the device. </p>
<p> This time, we talk about something more than that, with the Mobo Portal which enhances the functionality and makes it possible to not just transfer the files but also the text messages, directly the message threads that were on the device and vice versa. </p>

Apart from that, the portal keeps updating you with the weather information of your city in a small pop-up window, which can be hidden and activated any time.

<p> Moborobo – All In One Android Phone Management Software – Review </p>
<p> Controlling the smartphone from the computer is what one would love to do, especially when they get to do most of the stuff on the larger screen. We did talk about the same app earlier too, but the Moborobo software for the Windows OS is a brilliant tool which would deserve another mention especially for the features including all the personalization options, backing up of the data, sending SMS and memos from the tool to anyone in your contacts and quite a lot more. </p>
<p> MoboRobo – Smartphone Management Tool for Windows </p>
<p> Watch the Video Review Below : </p>
<p> For browsing the files of Android phones in the Windows OS, you always had to ensure that the drivers of the smartphone are installed and then you have enabled the USB flash drive mode whenever you connect the device to the computer, but here, Moborobo does most of the stuff and you just have to enable the USB debugging mode to access the file system. I played around with the tool to see how good the newest version of it is, and I feel it could beat several other phone management software’s easily, mainly for the reason that it doesn’t present itself to you with a hard-to-use interface, and even a new user would easily get acquainted with it. </p>
<p> Moborobo comes with a plethora of options, and the main and useful ones which every user would love the tool for, are as listed below. </p>
<p> Data Management – This one would include the personal stuff such as the Contacts, Messages, Call Logs which can be backed up, and any backup copies can be restored in case you had accidentally deleted any of data. </p>
<p> Apps Management – The apps which are installed already in the smartphone are listed, and you choose to uninstall them, or you may try to install any new apps directly from the software </p>
<p> Images – This would show all the images that are present in the connected phone, and you can choose any image from the app’s own online directory to set them as wallpapers or download the images </p>
<p> Music & Videos – The software would help you manage all the music and videos of the smartphone, and even let you transfer new files in the same time </p>
<p> Themes – There is a separate section for the themes, but this would be only for those who are using the launcher provided by Moborobo team, i.e. Mobo Live launcher. </p>
<p> Now, let me explain how you can connect your Android smartphone to the Moborobo software for the all-in-one management. Download Moborobo, install it and then open the software. You will now have to go to Settings in your phone, and in that, go to Developer options and enable the USB debugging. </p>
<p> Once you have enabled the USB debugging, all you need to do is to connect the device to the computer with the USB cable, for the connection via USB, which is the best way although there are other options such as Wi-Fi connection. </p>
<p> Once the connection is successful, the home screen of Moborobo would show the basic details about the smartphone, including the battery percentage and the charging status (shows charging as the USB connection also helps in charging the phone), and there would be details about the storage in the device and the SD card. </p>
<p> Clicking on the Information icon would actually show some real good details, which includes the Serial number, the IMEI number, IMSI, MAC, Android version, Baseband version and the Kernel version along with the model number of the smartphone. </p>
<p> Contact / SMS / Call Log Management </p>
<p> The Moborobo app shows all the contacts that are saved in your Android phone, and these would be even shown in groups if you have set them. All the messages and call logs too would be shown, and you can choose to add, delete, modify, backup and restore any of them. </p>
<p> Exporting the Contacts </p>
<p> This is one of the best and easiest parts with Moborobo, where the transferring of contacts is the main intention – from Android to Android, or from Android to iPhone and vice-versa. It’s the same .vcf or the Outlook files which are used by the programs to restore the contacts to an iPhone, so all you need to do here is export all the contacts. </p>
<p> App Manager – Uninstall, Install from Web </p>
<p> You don’t always need to go to the Play Store for that, as one can easily download and install any apps from within Moborobo, and there is a whole list of the user and system apps shown for the device, from which one can choose to uninstall in a batch, rather than manually uninstalling one at a time in the device. </p>
<p> The users would be notified of any pending app updates, and the updating can be done from the same window. </p>
<p> There’s also the rating system where the user can give their own ratings for the apps they use, making this a close community of the Moborobo users, sharing their experience with the other users in the form of ratings. </p>
<p> Image management – Camera Album, Wallpaper Center </p>
<p> For those who have hundreds of photos in their camera album and feel it hard to manage all of them, it becomes easier here with the batch actions, and the Moborobo tool has its own wallpaper center where the best photos from different categories can be downloaded and set as the wallpaper for the smartphone. </p>
<p> Ending the search – Download Ringtones for Free </p>
<p> One wouldn’t really need to now Google it to search for some good ringtones for the phone. The PandaApp Ringtone directory in the Moborobo lists the best ringtones, which you can play and then download the ones you need. To make it even easier, there are options to directly set the tune as the default ringtone. </p>
<p> Video Management – Batch Delete, Modify and Move </p>
<p> The video managing is easier, although we would have loved if the app allowed to batch rename the files with a specific first word followed by the numbers in order. The videos can be played, exported or deleted and there’s a MoboPlayer which would preview the videos before you choose to do some action. </p>
<p> Backup Data from Android Phone using Moborobo </p>
<p> Now comes the most useful part for the smartphone users – Data backup. The items that can be backed up at once include: </p>
<p> Images </p>
<p> The multi-select option would do the backing up process easier, and the managing isn’t hard because all the backups are saved in different folders based on the item. You can choose the folder where to backup the files to, and add a memo (e.g. date) to remember what was the data backed up then. </p>
<p> Restoring the Backup Files using Moborobo </p>
<p> Restoring is no different. The tool would automatically fetch the backups that you did earlier, and will ask you to select the things to restore. If at all the one which you wanted to restore isn’t listed, you could do that by manually fetching the backup file. </p>
<p> Phone cleanup </p>
<p> The phone cleanup option would search for all the cache files, the app installation remaining files and after deletion of this, the performance of the smartphone is improved. Of course there are quite a lot of apps which would do the memory and speed optimization, but is there a need when this comes as an additional feature in Moborobo? </p>
<p> There’s a lot in the Settings section to play around with, including the floating window, the file transfer mode, the weather settings for the information shown in the floating window, message and startup options etc. </p>
<p> Wrap-up – Overall Review </p>
<p> The Moborobo tool is surely a very powerful all-in-one software for the Windows OS, which would help users manage the Android and iOS smartphones in a better and easier way. Providing options to manage the SMS, Contacts, Call log, backing up and restoring the phone data, managing photos, videos and music and giving a quick platform for users to send SMS directly from the computer using the SIM from the smartphone, is all very much a handy list of functions of the Moborobo tool. Moreover, this is a free software and you don’t have to hit your head hard trying to understand what all can be done, and how to get things done. </p>

<p> MoboRobo v3.0 Review – A Perfect Android Phone Manager for Windows </p>
<p> Managing your Android smartphone from your personal computer is one of easiest way to do so, for a lot of reasons. And we’ve even talked about the best ones in the past, one of them staying right at the top – the MoboRobo platform that stays in your Windows OS computer and does most of the job that you need to keep the data secure and synced, keeping you away from the nightmares of losing the data. </p>
<p> MoboRobo cannot be called a data syncing software, as it does much more than that, to be a perfect manager for Android smartphone, and the improvements in the new update, i.e. v3.0 brings in something that makes the tool look more interesting, and act speeder than before. </p>
<p> I personally like to always check the notifications, SMS and whatever files the Android device has, directly on a computer screen and some browser add-ons do a job of showing up the unread notifications, but there are limitations. The MoboRobo does what is needed, with personalized options and the stuff isn’t limited to just notifications and SMS, because even the applications of the smartphone are managed by the software. </p>
<p> For a quick overview, here are some of the important features of MoboRobo v3.0, that we are talking of right now. </p>
<p> Main features of MoboRobo on PC </p>
<p> Contact Transfer – cross smartphone platform: The tool makes it easy to transfer contacts between Android and iOS, thus essential for those who are changing and upgrading to a new smartphone. </p>

<p> And for the key features of this app, here they are. </p>

<p> Performance management: The app comes with some useful management tools such as residual file cleaner, RAM booster, search and others for a better phone performance. </p>
<p> The most important part is how these both, i.e. MoboRobo and MoboMarket link up with each other whenever a bridge is created with the connection of smartphone to the PC, and based on the content in the smartphone, MoboMarket is able to suggest some recommended apps and such. When MoboRobo is installed and used to connect the phone to PC, MoboMarket Android app is automatically installed onto the device, and then the perfect connectivity happens. </p>
<p> MoboRobo v3.0 Review </p>
<p> To start off, we already did a MoboRobo review in the past, and since then there have been a lot of changes and neat upgrades to the features of the software. The v3.0 includes the following noticeable changes: </p>
<p> New UI, looks more colorful and intuitive </p>
<p> Auto update of apps, feature newly added </p>

<p> Now, to download MoboRobo on your computer, you need to go to the link given in the end of this review and you’ll have to go to Settings in your Android smartphone and under the developer options, enable the USB debugging so that it helps the software form a bridge between the two devices and help in connection. </p>
<p> Once you connect the Android smartphone to the computer, it will automatically detect the smartphone and list the model number on the MoboRobo screen. The home page of the app is the most interesting and useful one, as you get to see not just the phone information and battery status, but several shortcuts too are listed. The storage information and options to backup and cleanup the device are also available directly. </p>
<p> To find everything easily, there is this Toolbox which has management tools for SMS, Contacts, SMS chat, Call logs, file management, Bookmarks and device info, and a separate tool box gives options for backup and restore of device data, capturing screenshots directly from the computer and fullscreen display of phone screen on PC, cleanup of device and creation of ringtones for the Android smartphone. </p>

<p> Monitor Internal Memory Disk Usage on Android & Save Space </p>
<p> When you have installed so many application your phone, it practical that your phone takes considerably much time to response. This article is related on internal memory disk usage and saving space on your Android phone. </p>
<p> First thing is we will go through on how to check the total storage on your phone. To find out the space available on your mobile phone, you need to tap on the Menu > Settings and ‘SD card and phone storage‘. This will display the total size available on your phone, available space, unmounted SD card and internal phone storage available space. </p>
<p> When you press the Menu > Settings > Applications and Manage applications you will see each individual segment of phone along with the memory used by them. The Manage application classifies the memory usage on your phone depending on the application download, All applications, on SD card and the running applications. If you observe carefully, then you will notice that this doesn’t give you accurate statistics on total memory consumption on my SD card and on the USB storage. </p>
<p> To get a better understanding on the disk space usage we recommended to go with Disk Usage android application. Disk Usage is an Android application which allows you to get visual representation on the directories which consumes internal storage memory. This application on your Android mobile phone and tablets displays the size occupied by each directories on the disk space where they are stored. This application can be downloaded from Android Apps Labs for free. </p>
<p> When you install this application, open it with view selection as ‘App Storage’ and then click on Menu > Scan to scan for the directories with their usage space. All right I have the following storage card usage on my Galaxy S2 mobile phone – As you see in the above screenshot that total storage capacity is 11780 MB and it has 7854 Mb of free storage shown in the second column. Among the storage card usage, it gives you clear view of how much each folder is consuming the space. </p>
<p> This application is must to free some of the space which you don’t require and from this application you can distinguish that which application shouldn’t be using your internal memory and alternatively you can make arrangements to move that application to SD card. The only thing which is missing in this application is to move the application automatically to SD card from the internal memory. Not a problem, as a suggestion from us, you can install the App2SD android application to move the application which are installed on your internal storage to the SD card and reduce the load on your phone. This intern increase the response time on your phone. </p>
<p> 5 Comments </p>
<p> by the way I tried the application that you mention it is really really great with hey very good graphic interface to give a clear picture of what takes more memory </p>
<p> this is great useful stuff no I would like to find a way to troubleshoot problems such as why my smart phone restarts several times a day and why I sometimes lose my 3G connection … any ideas? </p>

The leather bands are priced at $29.99 each, and the metal bands cost $79.99 each. The leather bands are available in black, stone and cognac varieties, while the stainless steel bands come in light or dark shades. </p>
<p> The metal bands have a butterfly clasp, tri-link design, and are made of solid stainless steel of the “highest quality.” The leather comes from Horween, a tannery in the United States. Recently, Motorola has launched another version of their Moto 360 smart watch. The latest one is the Slim Steel version, and it comes with a thinner watch strap than the original metal version. </p>
<p> Earlier: Motorola’s Gold Moto 360 and metal bands officially launched – Details Date – Nov 7,2014 Motorola has officially unveiled the champagne gold Motor 360, slimmer watch bands and more, new accessories and choices that popped up originally in an Amazon leak at the end of October. Champagne Gold version is completely coloured in gold. All metal bands are crafted from aircraft-grade stainless steel and are specially designed not to interfere with the smart watches’ radio components. The bands come in both the larger 23 mm size and the more petite 18 mm. </p>
<p> The metal strap versions of the Moto 360 are priced at $299.99. Champagne Gold version is priced at $329.99. When the Moto 360 was officially made available in September, Motorola promised to bring the steel band variants sometime this year. </p>
<p> Earlier : Moto 360 appears on Amazon with Metallic Bands – Pricing & Details date – 30 October 2014 Amazon is now officially selling the Moto 360 smart watch in more colors and with alternate bands. A champagne gold coloured Moto 360 has appeared on Amazon.com alongside the new metal watchbands. Before today, you could get the Android Wear device with stainless steel or black finish, with black, grey, or “stone grey” bands only. </p>
<p> Also arrives on Amazon is a new Moto 360 color combo: silver with brown leather. There’s also an 18mm variant of the Champagne color. We were able to find a wider 23mm variant retailing for the same price. The champagne gold coloured Moto 360 is priced at $299, although it is not available for purchase yet. </p>
<p> A Champagne gold color option of the Motorola Moto 360 smart watch and alternate bands were briefly available on a pre-order on Amazon but product pages were taken off immediately. </p>
<p> Earlier – Moto 360 with Android Wear Showcased at Google I/O, coming later this year – Details, June 26th, 2014 </p>
<p> Moto 360 that was announced earlier was showcased at the Google I/O but the official pricing and release date of the device has not been mentioned, and the smartwatch would be available later this year. This Moto 360 is wearable device that runs Android Wear, which is Google software that is designed to be working on all the wearable devices like smart watches. This device was displayed along with the LG G Watched and the Samsung Gear but has an elegant circular design unlike the square rectangular displays. </p>
<p> In addition to its display, the Moto 360 sports customizable leather with metal straps and it is rumored to be getting an OLED display. The specifications of this device are not reveled yet, but it has a beautiful UI (User Interface) that can be swiped to see all other notifications. We need to wait until the company unveils all its specifications, features and pricing later this year when it get released. </p>
<p> Earlier – Moto 360 Smart Watch with Android Wear OS Announced – Details – march 18th, 2014 </p>
<p> The wearable category is in a booming pace, as we see a smartwatch being teased already by Motorola. Named the Moto 360, the smartwatch is going to be powered by Android Wear. Yes, the same OS which was just announced by Google. Things happen pretty quickly once there is a source available, and here’s an example of that. </p>
<p> It’s time for a watch that looks and feels great and gives you the information you need, when you need it. – That’s how Motorola introduces this. But for the features given, it’s nothing really new. But the final point – it’s going to be Android in the end, so you are going to see a lot of possibilities with this. As for the Moto 360 showcased by the company, it would let you keep up with time and date, and would keep you updated with the stuff you wanted to know on time. There are various alerts and notifications shown on the smart watch, and with the twist of the wrist, you would be able to see a lot other details such as the next meeting, latest social updates from your friends etc. </p>
<p> Just like you saw on the Moto X, the Moto 360 would respond to the voice commands, where saying “Ok Google” is enough to wake it up and make it ready to listen to your command. There is a lot you can ask, from your flight details to a live score, from scheduling an appointment to setting an alarm. It’s more like the features of the smartphone getting into the smartwatch, and that’s where the advancement in the technology is seen. </p>
<p> Look wise, you are seeing something excellent – round face and premium materials, and the options to choose between the leather and metal ones. You are asking too early if you wanted to know about the actual announcement, availability or such stuff because there is nothing really known and we are expecting to know more about it soon. Coming Summer 2014 is what is said by Motorola for now. </p>

<p> Moto ACTV – Steps to Root & Install Android Market Place </p>
<p> Moto Actv, the very own World’s first Android Watch too gets the root treatment. Now you may ask on what can you do with the rooted Android watch, one thing which you can benefit from rooting is that Rooting opens up the Android Market Place which we will see in the next article but before that we will check out on how to root the Moto Actv. Before we proceed, you need to go through the list of pre requisites which you need to follow and followed by which we will see the procedure in the every same page. Very soon we will also see Android powered refrigerators. </p>
<p> Note: This article should not be applied to root Motorola Actv Model and should not be applied to the phones which have model number as Moto Actv. </p>
<p> Disclaimer: Please note that we should not be held liable or responsible in any manner in whole or in parts if anything wrong happens to your device which is the most unlikely if you follow the instructions as prescribed in the due course of this article. </p>
<p> Quick Pre Requisites: </p>
<p> Please note that you need to ensure that the watch is charged to a maximum possible level so as to ensure that it doesn’t get turned Off in the middle of rooting update. </p>
<p> Also, all the data need to be synced with the Moto Sync or else all the data will get erased. </p>
<p> Ensure that you are on the 4.55.78 version firmware version which you can check from your Moto Actv device from About section from the Settings. </p>
<p> So, assuming that you have followed all the instructions which are mentioned above, you can now proceed to the procedure which is mentioned below. </p>
<p> Procedure to Root Motorola Actv Android Watch: </p>
<p> First up you need to Download the Motorola Actv Firmware Boot Image in your computer and then you need to turn Off your Moto Actv Android watch so as to enter the watch in the recovery mode. </p>
<p> After turning the Android Watch, you need to hold the Power Key and start Key for 3 seconds and then need to release the same so as to enter the watch in the fast boot mode. If the device powers ON in the normal mode then you need to again try to enter the device in the fast boot mode. </p>
<p> Now, once you get into the fast boot mode, you need to now connect the Moto Actv to the computer using the Original USB cable which you got at the time of purchase and then run the following commands in the command prompt in your computer. </p>
<p> fastboot flash boot boot.img fastboot reboot </p>
<p> After this, once the device is rebooted you will be able to connect the device in the adb mode using the Zergrush tool. You can also additionally make use of SuperOne Click Rooting tool to root the device. </p>
<p> Once the device is rooted, you need to make a backup image of your system partition as there is no stock image available. You can do this by running the following command as root on adb shell. </p>
<p> Now, exit the ADB and type in the below mentioned command, </p>
<p> adb pull /sdcard/system.img system.img </p>
<p> Now, take the system.img and save it in the safe location as we will be needing it later. Now you can load the launcher using the adb install command or also you can remove the default launcher by again mounting the file system and saving the launcher to the sd card. As soon as you do this, the launcher will be installed successfully. You can use the Honeycomb launcher 1.8 which is tried and tested. </p>
<p> Now, that’s it you can now even install the Google Apps by downloading it from the Cyanogen Mod’s website. Once you are done with this you need to now re enable the mass storage sync with the Motorola tools and run the command stop adb in the adb shell itself. </p>
<p> Do let us know just in case if you face any issues in the comments section as we will try to ensure that all your issues are sorted out at the earliest. </p>

<p> I’m really close to pulling the trigger on one of these since the price-drop, but I’ve been using Runkeeper forever and I’d like to keep using it. If I root the MOTOACTV is it still usable like normal? Second, if I root it, can I ADB push or sideload the Runkeeper APK and use that? If I can somehow use RK on this device, and still have it function as a watch/GPS/music player without it being a pain to use, I’ll go buy one at lunch! </p>
<p> my question is that if do doing to my MOTOROLA ACTV still be able to sync with my cell phone to receive calls and messages? </p>
<p> common we are not all developers or experts or hackers like you, please make a full video in full details, this is too hard, i have passed 36 hurs on my pc now yet, i still dnt get it because the info is not clare, i stoped at the part were ur motoactive sceen turned red… </p>
<p> Please if u want money or some payment for a video review just say it, am sure people are ready to pay. But replying almost every comment people write complaining about their problems en’t helping anybody at all. </p>
<p> I can’t get the adb driver to work… it just can’t find my device (adb devices command doesnt show anything) and Pradeep the driver for adb IS NOT in here… I saw you answering some other guy and you said the link to the driver is available at this site… anyway… anyone have a clue? PS: Yes I am in fastboot mode and when I plug the cable it shows USB on the watch screen. </p>
<p> I got a 8gb version in London, after an upgrade it has 4.57.78, as 4.55.78 is mentioned, would this method here work as well? 55=us 57=europe or what do these numers represent? </p>
<p> i have that installed and still nothing. when i hit the menu button and it shows a list of apps the message Running Apps Carousel not complete. Please be patient. and then if i click on something it force closes. Also i cant get the original launcher to work on it either; it just does the swipe left or right demo then closes back to the other launcher. i use this program someone created on the xba forums for im am not as tech savvy to actually go into the command log and get everything working. its called MotoACTV Easy Modder. In it there is an option to install the package installer.apk (which i did) and theres stilll nothing working. ive even tried to install apps with adb install and its still not running. </p>
<p> yes, we are aware of this and developers are working on the same! we will update you very soon on the same! also some of the apps are not compatible! </p>
<p> Flash your back up of your system.img through that tool and that should fix your stock launcher problem. You probably removed all system apks. </p>
<p> Im not sure what this means. are you going to be adding the link to the site for the correct .apk file? Updatin gthe notes to include a file name? can you tell me what i am looking for then i can look it up on my own. </p>
<p> When trying to reload the system.img via fast boot, I receive the message (bootloader) image bigger than partition — FAILED (remote failure) — As of now, my device is bricked. Any ideas? </p>
<p> THIS LINE IS WRONG IN YOUR TUTORIAL : “dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk1p18 of=/sdcard/system.img bs=1024” </p>
<p> go into the freenode irc channel #motoactv and we can help you there </p>
<p> Ricky Brent posted this and it includes a fix : </p>
<p> 2) Get the system image like this instead — Chris Wade updated the directions — otherwise, you will need to update your img file like this: dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk1p18 of=/sdcard/system.img bs=1024 count=159616 adb pull /system/system.img system.img </p>
<p> I think I have bricked my device… I rooted it and then installed the application but I think i didnt install the launcher properly. I can get the fastboot to load but it always says that the battery is low. Also If I plug it in it just comes up with the motorola screen and wont move from there. Any help would be awesome thanks guys! </p>
<p> I cant get anything to work. when i try to open any application it force closes. i have the launcher running but that’s about it. </p>
<p> What applications have u tried … You cant install apps on it unless you install them through adb using adb install whateveryourapksnameis.apk or extract the package installer.apk from gapps and place it in system apps .. There is a batch script some one wrote for us and is very helpful i put a link up for it here but the writer of this post didnt want it or something. We are also working on getting a recovery and a full gingerbread rom running on this. </p>
<p> i have that installed and still nothing. when i hit the menu button and it shows a list of apps the message “Running Apps Carousel not complete. Please be patient.” and then if i click on something it force closes. Also i cant get the original launcher to work on it either; it just does the swipe left or right demo then closes back to the other launcher. i use this program someone created on the xba forums for im am not as tech savvy to actually go into the command log and get everything working. its called MotoACTV Easy Modder. It also has a function to install the package installer.apk (which i tried) and still nothing. </p>
<p> is there a way to have both the apps and the fitness function installed at the same time? </p>
<p> Yes their is … just don’t remove the stock launcher and install button savior or home switcher to launchers and as long as you don’t remove any system apks you are gg </p>
<p> if you visit this website a member posted a “ALL IN ONE” batch script that will simplify things for people having problems.. it doesnt root yet but that part is the easy one </p>
<p> How do I install GAPPS? What I did was take each APK from the .zip file and installed it using however I’m getting Force Close for google framework and market when I try to access market. </p>
<p> hi, how do you clear cache from manage apps, is this done on the watch? or adb? thanks for the help </p>
<p> How do you “re enable the mass storage sync”? What version of Cyanogen should you use? </p>
<p> Mass storage sync is re enabled by opening a command line and typing adb shell then type stop adbd </p>
<p> What do I do if my motoactv is in a bootloop. I successfully rooted it, but when I deleted some apps that I had installed through adb, it won’t boot up anymore. I can’t even shut it off. What should i do?!? </p>
<p> you should not install adb after applying the update as it will fully wipe the device, please try repeating the process now! </p>
<p> I have a 16gb Motoactv which has recently updated to software version 4.56.78. Am I still able to root the device using these current instructions and this current boot.img file? </p>
<p> Another issue I have is that when I hook up the device to the computer and begin running the fastboot program on both device and computer, the computer fastboot can’t find the boot.img file despite my having downloaded it. Is there any particular file that I need to move it to? </p>
<p> I have the 16gb motoactv and I’ve just undergone the update to 4.56.78. Will this root file still work with my device or do I need to wait for an update to the root files? Also, whenever I’ve downloaded the boot.img file and run fastboot to start the process, fastboot can’t find the boot.img file – where do I need to place that file so it can be found? Thanks. </p>
<p> you need to isntall the adb in your pc and then connect the device to pc to push the file via fastboot! </p>
<p> I cannot get fastboot.exe to recognize the device. I have seen mentions of another fastboot required. Can anyone offer any help. I have installed the full Android SDK. Motodev studio (not in it), some standalone fastboot packages they all do the same thing return nothing. the device looks ok bootloader mode and detects when I plug and unplug the cable. still googling around but was hoping I could get some help/ </p>
<p> Turned out to be a bad device. The battery died as well. Sorry for the false alarm. </p>
<p> 1) Take a backup of your userdata partition too, just like your system img; otherwise, it can get corrupted and make the file loop at the motorola logo: dd if=/dev/block/userdata of=/sdcard/userdata.img bs=1024 adb pull /sdcard/userdata.img userdata.img </p>
<p> 2) Get the system image like this instead — Chris Wade updated the directions — otherwise, you will need to update your img file like this (http://pastie.org/private/l69macvlfcrsjqg33g35w): dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk1p18 of=/sdcard/system.img bs=1024 count=159616 adb pull /system/system.img system.img </p>
<p> 3) You can remap your top start button to menu fairly easily. After you get root, edit this file: /system/usr/keylayout/G2-keypad.kl Change this line: key 220 FITNESS WAKE_DROPPED to this: key 220 MENU WAKE_DROPPED … then reboot. This will make it no longer work in the motorola apps, however. </p>
<p> 4) I found Zeam a great alternative to the Honeycomb launcher. It doesn’t take up as much memory, and you can avoid the Honeycomb launcher’s issue where the small screen size causes icons to overlap. – Install Zeam the same way you installed the honeycomb launcher — aka, download it and adb install the apk. – Press and hold in a blank area, and go to “add”, then “shortcuts”, then “settings”, then “settings” again — this will give you an icon you can use to change the wifi and enter in new information. </p>
<p> thanks for the extra info Ricky ! and thank you Pradeep for the help! </p>
<p> i have 1 more question… </p>
<p> i cant seem to get motoactv to launch when i connect my device how would i go about enabling that? </p>
<p> Can you please explain how to establish fastboot with my device … I open terminal and type fastboot devices but the serial for my device does not come up </p>
<p> How do you proceed with the instalation of the Google APPS. Please explain the steps to do this specificaly as I have tried without any luck. </p>
<p> I bricked my motoactv. Now it won’t go past the fastboot mode, and I cannot connect it through adb. I have tried restoring the system.img, but every time it fails! Please help! </p>
<p> I’m in a bootloop and can’t seem to get out of it. I can get to fastboot but not sure what to do. </p>
<p> I made it through all the instructions but when it gets to the end and says “you can now install the hcl launcher”…im stuck b/c i dont have the .apk file. where do i obtain this from? i did a search through all of the zergush tools folder as well as the android sdk folder. which .apk file am i looking for and where do i obtain it? </p>
<p> My problem with this tutorial is that it’s pretty much a straight copy and paste from the author. Can you actually make a tutorial of step by step for someone who has no experience with rooting and have no idea how to do any of this stuff? </p>
<p> we had to stick to the info from source as we haven’t tried this! you can refer the source for the same! </p>

<p> Deal: Moto G Available for $100 via US Cellular from February 10th </p>
<p> Moto G is an awesome device considering its price with some serious hardware, and the response from the customers can already say how good Motorola did in the past few months, initially with the Moto X, and then this budget phone. The device is placed at $180 for its 4.5 inch 720p touch screen display and it on of very few devices running on Android 4.4 KitKat Operating System. This device is now available for a discounted price of $99.99 on Verizon. </p>
<p> The Moto G lovers should be excited after this news, the US cellular is now giving away the Moto G for $99.99 with a discount of $80 for a device which is already costing low, now that’s called a deal! The 8 GB version which on the deal, has a Snapdragon 400 processor coupled with a 1 GB RAM and will be running on Android 4.4 KitKat with a 5 MP snapper on its back and a 2070 mAh battery on its back. The only thing that this device will be missing is the LTE connectivity. </p>
<p> This device can be bought online right away with the price of $99.99 or you can still get it from the stores starting from February 10th. This device is available for $180 off contract. So what are you waiting for? Go grab the device as soon as you can. Stay tuned for more updates and information. There’s quite a long story about the pricing of the Moto X which was launched with a hefty pricing, but then had kept reducing the price, before finally being priced at $329 through Feb 14th as a part of promotion that Motorola is running. After that, the price would be $399, which is still not very high considering the build and quality of the device. </p>
<p> Now that Motorola is acquired by Lenovo, there should be some speculation on how Motorola will be doing in the coming future, but for now, these two devices were made when Google had an eye on it and thus, both the Moto X and Moto G were excellent. </p>

<p> Moto G Gen 2 Officially Announced, Hands-on & First Impressions – Price, Specs & Features </p>
<p> Motorola has finally announced the much awaited mid-range smartphone, which again does not goes by the rumoured names like Moto G+1 or Moto G2. Instead Motorola choose to stick with the Moto G, as it will be the second generation device. It is priced at an affordable $179, which converts to approximately INR 10,820 pricing for the 8GB variant of the new Moto G. Though, the official pricing in India is only confirmed for 16GB variant as it will cost INR 12,999,i.e. INR 1K less than the original Moto G. </p>
<p> The Moto G comes with a larger 5.0-inch HD (1280 x 720 pixels resolution) display, and is powered by a Quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor, which can clock at 1.2 GHz with the support of Adreno 305 GPU. The device will be running the latest Android 4.4.4 Kitkat and will get upgraded to the Android L version when it is available later this fall. </p>
<p> On the storage front, it packs a 1GB of RAM, and comes with a 8GB and 16GB internal storage variants with no mention of microSD card slot. The new generation device sports an 8MP rear shooter with 4X digital Zoom and Auto HDR support , at front you will find a 2MP front snapper for selfies. </p>
<p> For connectivity, the device offers various set of features like 3G HSPA+, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, microUSB, and GPS/GLANOSS. Its dimensions are 70.7 x 141.5 x 6.0-11.0mm and weighs 149 grams. All this is powered by the same 2070mAh battery that is present on the previous generation Moto G. It also boasts water repellent feature, though, the IPXX rating is not clear yet. </p>
<p> On the comparison note, the device will compete with the currently popular Xiaomi Mi3 as well as Asus Zenfone 5 and other handsets by Indian brands like Micromax, Karbonn and Lava mobiles. As the device boasts a larger 5.0-inch screen, therefore, giving already powerful and Android stock experience a boast. </p>
<p> We are at the Motorola launch event, and had a quick time with the new Moto G, the first thing we noticed is that the speakers are not placed at the front just like Moto E. At first it will feel a bigger device as screen size is increased to 5-inch, but once you get familiar with the design, it will be comfortable to hold. Even though, the display looks great, but during outdoor usage it will definitely have problem viewing as during our indoor usage we noticed the reflections that can be seen in the below posted images. </p>
<p> With new Moto X taking a place closer to the high-end flagship device, new Moto G will be filling the gap as the hardware specs are now improved up to the mid-higher range of smartphones. With Xiaomi coming to India, the previous Moto G was kind of left behind, though. The new Moto G will be aiming the mid as well as the mid-higher categories for sale. It might not be more slimmer than the previous Moto X or the Xiaomi’s Mi3, but it sure will have the styles as the company has also introduced a new set of accessories for Moto G, which includes Motorola Shells available in many colors and the flip covers that will also feature different colourful variants. </p>
<p> Indian consumers can purchase this smartphone staring today only, retaining the partnership with Flipkart, it will be available on the retailer’s website from the midnight, i.e. September 6,2014 00:00 IST. </p>

<p> The Moto G is officially announced by Google, and this is the company’s attempt to bring out a budget device for a low cost. The pricing set for this one is $179 unlocked and without contract. Unlike the Motorola Moto X, the Moto G would not have any customization option for the back panel, but the Moto G’s back cover is removable and the colors with which they can swap it, is blue, teal, red, yellow, purple, white, and black colors. </p>
<p> The different official specifications of the Moto G include: </p>
<p> 4.5-inch capacitive touchscreen </p>
<p> TFT HD display, 1280 x 720 pixels screen resolution </p>
<p> 8GB / 16GB storage internally </p>
<p> 5-megapixel rear camera with LED flash </p>
<p> Although the back cover of the Moto G is removable, you cannot remove the battery. Also, there is no MicroSD card slot, thus you have an option to select Moto G Android Phone; $179 for 8GB and $199 for 16GB variant from Amazon’s website. This smartphone will be shipped starting December, 04, 2013. </p>
<p> Earlier: The press photos of the Moto G smartphone are now out, and this is just a day before the Moto G’s official announcement, that is to happen tomorrow. Moto G is going to be announced with a live steam being available to viewers from several countries, thus there is nothing much left until the announcement, but the press leaks do show that the design is quite neat and resembles a bit to the higher end version, the Moto X. </p>
<p> The Moto G is going to be announced officially and soon going to be available, from 13th November but a listing on Amazon UK has already revealed the pricing of the smartphone. Apart from this, the GFX Benchmark list showed this device and it revealed that the Moto G is going to have a 720p display, and there would be a 1.2 GHz Cortex A7 processor with the Adreno 305 GPU. It would be running the Android 4.4. KitKat OS. </p>
<p> The Moto G XT1032 is going to be priced at £160 and the release date is still the same – Nov 13th. It’s just two days from now, so do come back to get to know more about the budget friendly device from Motorola. </p>
<p> Earlier: Motorola has put up a teaser for its upcoming Android smartphone, the Moto G on a separate website where it says the smartphone would launch on November 13th. The announcement of the smartphone would be live streamed, so that’s good for everyone who wanted to catch the details live. Motorola’s Twitter account gave some indication through different languages, that the smartphone would come to at least these countries – India, Australia, France, Portugal, UK and Spain. Check out the earlier leaks below. </p>
<p> Earlier: There were some rumors flowing around, about the new Moto G from Motorola, after the Moto X which was launched recently. These rumors now end here as the actual promo of the device is leaked before the festival season, and the Moto G appeared on the company’s website before vanishing again. GSMArena leaked the photo along with the list of specs which make it look like a mid-range smartphone. </p>
<p> According to the leaked promo document, it’s a 4.5-inch 720p display and a 1.2 GHz Qualcomm processor, a quad-core chipset (earlier Evleaks had mentioned that there is Snapdragon S4 Pro 1.5 GHz included) and the device is reported to run the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean OS. There would be an internal storage of 8GB and a 5-megapixel camera on the rear side, and a 1.3 megapixel front shooter, while there are quite a few different connectivity options included in the Moto G, but there isn’t any info about the data network. The screen is said to have the Corning Gorilla Glass protection. </p>
<p> There is no release date provided yet, but the pricing is said to be set at £135 and that could be a serious entry from Motorola which can challenge to quite a few other smartphones with the similar range of specs. If the past leaks are confirmed, the Moto G could be coming with a 1950 mAh battery and the Dual-SIM connectivity might be true, as well as the customization options for the front and back panels just like it was for the Moto X. </p>
<p> There’s the Xperia Z1 Mini from Sony which has some good specifications for the 4.3-inch screen size of its, and that could be a good choice against the Moto G, but the other Mini versions (HTC One Mini and Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini) are no where near these two for the comparison. Surprising to see that there would be no Android 4.4 KitKat version, but let’s see what comes out officially, just in a few days. </p>

<p> Well, you might not be expecting some kind of danger always, but still it is better to be on the safe side. With this Moto Alert app you can just send messages to selected numbers from your contacts list. This app not only provides safety but also sends information about the location you are in and this is mainly a safety app as the name suggests and cannot be used as a tracker. </p>
<p> Once if you activate the alert mode the app will automatically sends a message to the designated contacts that shows your location by sending periodic messages, so that they can act accordingly. Moreover you can set up places such as School, Home or Work place and sends and sends an alert message to the contacts when you are leaving that location. </p>
<p> The user can also send messages to those contacts, updating with the current situation. The app gives you the options like, Meet me, Follow me and Emergency options or you can just type a message also. This app is pretty much helpful to people who travel to remote places or far places where they won’t have any one to help or when they are stuck in a problem. This app will be more useful for children’s and old people, so that the family member and friends can be tracking their status. </p>
<p> You also have another option of triggering an alarm so that people nearby can notice you and help you out. Another thing notable here is that you can send alert message to the contacts even if they do not posses this Motorola Alert app. For now this app is not available for the Moto X and Moto G smart phone but we can expect the company to roll it out soon if this pre-installed app on Moto E sets up perfectly. Do you own a Moto E? Did you set up the alert? If you didn’t, just launch the app and set up all the necessary things so that a message can be sent to the selected contacts along with a loud alarm. </p>
<p> We’d let you know when the app is available for the Moto G and Moto X. </p>

<p> Motorola AME 2000 Secure Mobile Solution for Federal Agencies using Android Devices </p>
<p> Motorola might have been out of the Android smartphone scene for quite a long time, but here’s what they have come up with. An exclusive Android device for federal agencies that could make use of smartphones for their communication requirements. </p>
<p> Motorola Solutions has come up with a new android device, named the AME 2000 that comes with a AME 2000 Secure Mobile Solution. The phone isn’t yet another Android smartphone in the market, but has special hardware and software builds on it that have been customized to provide secure and highly confidential end-to-end encrypted voice and data communications through wireless networks in an encrypted way. This could be a great device for federal and government agencies which use the Android platform or Android based applications and processes to handle their working schedules and applications. </p>
<p> The phone also comes with CRYPTR micro, a hardware security module with tamper protection for keys, tokens and certificates. Further, smaller customizations and tweaks can be added to the phone as needed by the federal agency of the country and that would make a great addition to the complete functioning of the smartphone. </p>
<p> Though not much information on the specifications of the phone, its distribution patterns or its availability isn’t available as of now, the AME 2000 does seem quite promising on the front it is trying to cater to. </p>

<p> Motorola begins Android 5.1 Lollipop Soak Test for Moto X 2014 </p>
<p> Motorola has just kicked off its first Android 5.1 soak test for the Moto X 2014 ahead of a wider public rollout.Like all Motorola soak tests, this one will be available to select users only. It has been seeded to a small group in an effort to uncover any bugs or instabilities that need to be fixed ahead of an official release. But if all goes well, Motorola could make the update available to others very soon. In the past, official releases have come as soon as one week after a soak test, but others have taken up to six weeks. </p>
<p> ChangeLog </p>
<p> Block interruptions until your next alarm. This choice will show only when you have an alarm set within the next 12 hours. It will prevent you from missing an alarm when you choose ‘No interruptions’. </p>
<p> You can choose to enter a scheduled downtime early. For example, if you are going to bed early and change your notification settings, you can choose “Until your downtime ends”. This option will be visible when within 4 hours of the scheduled start of your downtime. </p>
<p> Adds icons to the volume settings panel that match those that will show in the status bar (None, Priority). </p>
<p> You can now alter notification volume controls while media is playing. With the volume controls showing, a tap on the bell icon will bring up notification volume controls. </p>
<p> Heads-up Notifications: in addition to dismissing a heads-up notification, you can now swipe it up to remove it from your screen. It will remain in your notifications tray and you can dismiss it later. </p>
<p> Quick Settings: you can quickly select different Wi-Fi access points or different paired Bluetooth devices with a new pull-down menu on each tile. Conditional settings tiles that only show if you use the feature – like “Invert Colors” or “Hotspot” – can now be hidden via a long-press on the tile. </p>
<p> Camera: reduced noise in low-light shots and improves responsiveness of the viewfinder with the front-facing camera (selfie). </p>
<p> Device Protection; Lost or stolen devices will remain locked until you sign in with your Google account, even if reset to factory settings. Note that you must have a Google account on the device to automatically enable this feature and set a PIN, password or pattern screen lock. </p>
<p> Performance Improvements in the Android Runtime (ART) lead to faster application launch times. </p>
<p> Lockscreen; if you have enabled Ambient Display, the minimum swipe distance has increased to reduce accidental interactions. </p>

The phone is priced at Rs. 6999 and it is available on Flipkart. It is a Dual-SIM smartphone with the 4.3-inch display. </p>
<p> The Moto E is going to be sold in the Indian market first, than anywhere else, thanks to the positive response the earlier devices got, especially because of the aggressive pricing set for some promising specs. India is an important market for us – Marcus Frost, Motorola. </p>
<p> Check out the hands-on video of the Moto E, from AdvicesMedia. </p>
<p> The smartphone would be available in 9 color options. It features a scratch resistant display and runs the Android 4.4 KitKat OS. There are different customized shells which the users can use. Unlike what was being claimed in the rumors, the Moto E comes with a 4.3-inch qHD display with the screen resolution (960×540 pixels), and it is to be powered by the Snapdragon 200 processor along with 1GB RAM. </p>
<p> Motorola Moto E Specifications </p>
<p> qHD display, 540×960 pixels screen resolution </p>
<p> 1.2 GHz dual-core Snapdragon 200 processor </p>
<p> 4GB internal storage, Expandable with MicroSD card </p>

<p> Earlier: Motorola Moto E Android Phone Leaked Photos & Specifications, Expected Pricing Details After the several leaks and rumors, we finally are able to get a few press shots of the Moto E, along with the list of specifications, through an online store which has listed the phone with the status – unavailable. The Moto E is leaked to have a 4.3-inch display, Snapdragon dual-core processor clocking at 1.2 GHz, 1GB RAM, 4GB internal storage with MicroSD card slot for storage expansion, Android 4.4, a 5MP camera on the rear side with no LED flash support, 1980 mAh battery. </p>
<p> Check out these press shots, which are leaked with the announcement to happen in a few days from now. </p>
<p> Earlier: Motorola confirmed last week that it was announcing a budget Android powered Smartphone quoted as “priced for all” on 13th of May in London. This low priced device named as the Motorola Moto E is being confirmed from one of the shipments that are sent to India and this shipment is carrying over thousand handsets and being mentioned as Motorola Moto E White. </p>
<p> This device is priced at Rs. 6,330 and can be expected to be lowered after its launch that is going to be held within a week’s time. This device is made considering the budget minded people and should be offering a good deal to all those who are looking a quality product from a well known brand. I am pretty much excited to see this device coming in to market and should wait and see how this device will be turning up. </p>
<p> Earlier – Motorola rumored to Launch a budget Android Phone in May (might be Moto E) – Details – April 19th, 2014 </p>
<p> Motorola has made some excellent news after getting acquired, and that was especially in the Indian market as the Moto X, which was available initially for more than $600 in the US, became available in India for around Rs. 23000 recently. Now the rumors talk about a new smartphone in the making, and this according to the rumors, is going to be a budget device. Considering the way consumers responded to the Moto G in India, the next one for sure would make a bigger impact, should Motorola consider launching it in the local markets and not stick with only Flipkart which they used to sell the Moto G. </p>
<p> Although the name is not known, it is expected to be called the Moto E and there was a specs sheet leaked by a brazilian website Tecnoblog, which showed a few basic specs of the device. According to that sheet, the upcoming smartphone has a 4.3-inch display (the resolution is not known), and it could be coming with a dual-core chipset clocking at 1.2 GHz. There is a 1GB RAM support, and the internatl storage of the device would be 4GB. Camera wise, the smartphone is going to come with a 5MP rear shooter. </p>
<p> Something really interesting noted about the smartphone is that it might be coming with the thickness of just 6.2mm, which would be pretty good although the battery capacity of 1900 mAh is said to be included within this thin package. The phone would be running Android 4.4 KitKat out of the box. </p>
<p> It might be coming in several variants, one of it being a Dual-SIM one, and the actual variant division would be based on the storage. The connectivity options included are 2G and 3G connectivity. There is Digital TV support too mentioned in the information, and the expected time for its launch is said to be May 2014. We’ll be updating when we learn more about it. </p>
<p> Well, Yet Another Moto smartphone ! 😀 Whatever, I have my eyes rolling on Galaxy S5 and I hope i will buy this one for my B’day ! Nice article btw ! Keep going 🙂 </p>
<p> Wow i am really stunned with price. I will change my option from samsung pro to this Moto E. It really looks promising smartphone. </p>

<p> First Motorola or lenovo start listening to customers request. Put up the real stores than selling 2nd grade quality products. Most importantly put up service stores. I have been struggling from a year to locate a lenovo registered service store for mobile in bangalore and hyderabad together. If I find some store they say won’t cover warranties. What the fuck is this. And these exclusively on flipkart thing is irritating like hell. Why don’t u guys sell in real stores. May be then you guys can’t sell 2nd or 3rd grade products. For Motorola n lenovo both spares and service stores are not available. And we customers are facing hell after buying these products. Never gonna buy online products and from moto or lenovo. </p>

<p> Motorola Confirms Android 5.0 Lollipop for Nine Devices – Details </p>
<p> If you are a Moto user, you may not have to wait long for the Android Lollipop 5.0, which was announced by Google yesterday. In a blog post, Motorola’s SVP for software engineering Steve Horowitz confirms that the following devices are in line for an Android 5.0 update — Moto X (1st and 2nd Gen), Moto G (1st and 2nd Gen), Moto G with 4G LTE, Moto E, Droid Ultra, Droid Maxx, and Droid Mini. </p>
<p> While the update to the new Moto G and the new Moto X was never in doubt. Motorola had not confirmed if it would bring the next version of Android to even Moto E, its lowest priced phone earlier. Moto hasn’t said exactly when these updates will begin rolling, but most probable it would be second in line after nexus phones. </p>
<p> Sundar Pichai, Google’s senior vice president of Android and Chrome, announced a new Android 5.0 in a blog post. Lollipop brings with it a new “Material Design” language for the UI and accompanying apps along with 5,000 new APIs for developers. Lollipop includes a new battery save mode that will supposedly boost battery life by 90 minutes when users find themselves close to running out of battery. Lollipop also includes Factor Reset Protection, which lets device owners disable their phone remotely. </p>
<p> As per Google, Lollipop is made to keep the experience of using Android consistent across devices. From phones to TVs to smart watches, if the device is running Lollipop, the interface will feel part of the same family, and transitions from device to device will be more seamless. And with things like music, photos and video remembering where you left off. </p>
<p> Google also unveiled three new Nexus devices yesterday as it looks to gain market share in the high-end mobile market. The Nexus 6 smartphone, Nexus 9 tablet and the Nexus Player streaming devices are priced near, or in line with, competing Apple devices. Nexus 9 and Nexus Player will be available for pre-order on October 17. Nexus 9 will be in stores starting November 3. Nexus 6 will be available for pre-order in late October and in stores in November month. </p>

<p> Motorola Droid Turbo Review – Phone with Long Lasting Battery </p>
<p> Motorola had launched the best budget smartphones with the Moto E, Moto G and the Moto X which came with some amazing features, especially the Twist your Wrist to Capture photo that was my favorite. </p>
<p> In 2014, they had launched the second generation Moto X that was also a great product, and now this is the 2015 Moto X, launched at the end of 2014 itself. This Droid has the name Turbo primarily for two reasons. One is the large 3900 mAh battery and second the Turbo Charging feature on this device. For your Info, this is also called as the Moto Maxx in a few countries. </p>
<p> Display : </p>
<p> Droid Turbo comes with a 5.2″ 2K Display with a resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels making it up at 565 PPI that is one of highest PPI we have seen except the Galaxy S6 which has 577 PPI. It’s a OLED display that is crisp, the black is very deep, and you would love watching videos on this one. The Display is crisp even when you browsing the web and if you wish to look into some details though there is not much content available for this resolution, except for YouTube off course. </p>
<p> Camera : </p>
<p> The Droid Turbo has the best Camera we have seen from Motorola in their complete series. The photos are not over saturated or processed the way we see on Samsung Phones like the Galaxy S5. The Camera supports 4K Video recording and has improved from the Moto-X 2014. Here are a few Samples that can give you an idea of the Camera of this Smartphone. </p>
<p> Battery : </p>
<p> The Droid Turbo comes with a 3900 mAh battery that is the highest we have seen on a phone from a Tier 1 brand. The best part is that even though with such a high capacity, the phone is not thick and has not lost any important features. The device comes with Snapdragon 805 and Adreno 420 which can perfectly ensure that you get the better backup. In my experience of using this I found that the battery is still not sufficient because the display kills it, and you end up with charging the device after say 30 hours or so which is still ok but not the best. Motorola claimed 48 hour’s usage while I didn’t get the same results, its still better than my last phone which was the iPhone 6. </p>
<p> Build : </p>
<p> The device comes with two options, i.e., the Ballistic Nylon, and Kevlar which is available only in Red, but is slippery while the Nylon finish is much more textured and feels great when holding in the hand. After using it for two months without any case, you can still look that the back looks great without any scars though it picks up a lot of dust from the pocket that is fine. The SIM Card slot on this one is hidden behind the volume keys that is again unique. The Device has many smooth edges that are a plus considering that you won’t likely drop it easily when using it as a daily driver. </p>
<p> Software : </p>
<p> Talking about the Software, the device came with KitKat out of the box. Which gave the same experience that we had seen in the Moto X 2014 and certainly its the best experience without any lags and near stock like UI. Apart from this the device has some custom ringtones, wallpapers and widgets that are amazing. </p>
<p> Some Amazing Features Include: </p>
<p> Moto Voice : You can customise the voice and interact with your phone, the way you speak to someone and this feature was introduced with the Moto X. Its not upto the mark on the Droid Turbo though I guess thats specific to this unit. </p>
<p> Moto Assist : The phone is Smart in understanding what kind of task you are into. When you drive the device activates the Driving Mode and reads aloud the text messages, while it can keep quiet when you are busy with a meeting and finally when you are about to sleep it turns off all the sounds and switches it back ON in the morning. </p>
<p> Moto Actions & Display : You can use simple gestures like waving your hand to silent any incoming calls or take a quick peek of upto 3 notifications which show up on your lock screen. </p>
<p> I love my Turbo! Best phone I have ever had. I have never had any problems with it during the 5 months or so I have had it. Processor is fast,display is bright and clear. </p>

<p> Motorola Lists ICS Update Schedule for All Devices </p>
<p> From the 2nd quarter of 2012, most of the Android mobile phones and devices from Motorola would start getting the update to their operating system, i.e. the Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 version. In the view, there is almost the entire list of Android devices which are going to get the update sooner or later, and unlike Samsung, Motorola hasn’t ignored any smartphone purposefully except the reason that the phone is too basic to handle the update and the heavy OS version. The reason for the time being taken for the updates to be released for each device is that the OS has to go through the various steps before being available to the public – Evaluation & Planning, Development, Testing and finally Available. </p>
<p> The only device which has the ICS update available right now is the Wi-Fi version of Motorola Xoom. The only requirement which Motorola has listed for the device to be compatible for the update is the RAM size, based on which the updates are listed. </p>
<p> XT882 </p>
<p> China </p>
<p> The update page has got the details based on the region too, apart from the specifications of the phone. There are even a few mobiles which would remain at the Android 1.6 or 2.1 versions as they were the first devices that entered the Android market and have the specifications which cannot handle the ICS update. </p>
<p> 5 Comments </p>
<p> I live in Australia, when can I expect the XOOM WiFi to get the update if at all? Can I load the USA version of the update onto my XOOM WIFI </p>

<p> Motorola Milestone Phone sold at Rs 14000 in India </p>
<p> After the recent news about the Motorola about its buyout by Google, seems like Motorola is lowering its device costs to sell the stocks of some particular handsets. In a similar move to this, Motorola Milestone now costs Rs. 14, 000 and is available in the flipkart. Though there is no exact details on by when this Offer will be valid for but since the cost has been really lowered a lot, it’s expected to get sold out. For once this handset used to cost almost at a double price for about Rs. 28, 000. Just in case if you want to know the quick specs of this phone, then we will see that same in the next paragraph. </p>
<p> To start with this phone comes along with the slide Out Qwerty keyboard along with a full capacitive touch screen with a display size of 3.7 inches with a resolution of 854 x 480 along with the dual LED flash and a powerful 600 MHz processor along with the 256 MB of RAM and comes with an internal storage of around 133 MB. Also, this phone is packed with an 8GB of micro SD card which can store practically accommodate unlimited phonebook contact entries along with the messages. This phone by default comes along with the Android’s Froyo 2.2 version of firmware along with the battery of 14400mah which promises to last for a stand by time of 350 Hours or for a talk time of around 6.5hrs. </p>
<p> The only disadvantage of this phone is it’s SAR level which is around 1.49 which is quite high compared to the other smart phones in that range. So, all in all it’s a good buy considering the fact that over a period of time this phone has managed to get good amout of customized ROMs and also the other beta releases of the firmware with which you will never feel that you have done something wrong in choosing this phone. </p>

<p> Motorola Moto E Benchmark Tests – AnTuTu, Quadrant Standard & Nenamark2 Scores </p>
<p> Motorola Moto E was launched a week earlier, and it has shaken the budget phone segment with its specifications for a low price. Motorola is not new in releasing powerful Smart phones for a low price, and having seen that with the Moto G that made a buzz in the market, the company had also come up with the flagship Moto X for an attractive price. To check out the performance of the Moto E Smartphone, we did a few benchmark tests and see how well it fared, and we compare that with the different mid-to-high end devices too, because the Moto E didn’t keep itself to the low grade when the performance is at question. </p>
<p> Considering the price range for it has been launched these are pretty good specifications. It has a 1.2 GHz quad core processor coupled with 1 GB of RAM. It will run the latest Android KitKat Operating System and has an on-board memory of 4 GB that can be further extended up to 32 GB via microSD. </p>
<p> Motorola Moto E AnTuTu Benchmark </p>
<p> The score that Moto E received is good enough, at 12492 making it good enough considering the price range, and is sitting behind the Redmi and Galaxy S3 but for the Snapdragon 200, this score is quite good. </p>
<p> Motorola Moto E Quadrant Standard Benchmark </p>
<p> This again is a test that would check the different parameters and the Moto E could easily beat the HTC One X and a few other devices, and the score of around 5280 is very neat.

<p> This is the final test we have done on the Moto E that is used to check out the performance based on the frames per second output for high quality graphics content. The score that came out is 48 fps which is pretty good. Over all this is good device compared to the pricing with the scores that it has got. </p>

<p> Motorola Moto E – List of Best Features & Why the Moto E is a Game Changer </p>
<p> We are once again surprised, and each one would be happy to see Motorola setting a price of Rs. 6999 for their latest phone: the Motorola Moto E. While we are totally blown away by the pricing set, which is going to beat any other smartphone in the competition. The case about competitive and aggressive pricing was the same with Moto G and then Moto X, which were expected to be priced higher than what Motorola finally settled for, and each and every brand in India which was holding a supreme position, felt the shake sent by Motorola. </p>
<p> Now, the budget smartphone market wasn’t ever good in India, and it was full of devices which couldn’t deliver the performance expected by the users for what they were paying, but the Moto E now, for me at least, is a game changer. Why? there are quite a few reasons for the same. </p>
<p> Firstly, the display is quite neat. I know many might have been disappointed after hearing the rumors of 720p display, but still, a qHD resolution isn’t that bad, and you get the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection along with the water-resistant splash guard for a better durability, and one can easily slide it into the pocket, where the keys and sharp objects won’t bother it much. </p>
<p> Android KitKat – the flavor of the latest OS, and that can be done only by Motorola for now. Just a few days back, the Galxay S3 users were given a news that their devices cannot get the KitKat update because of the 1GB RAM in it. It’s the same RAM in Moto E, but it runs the KitKat OS with the latest features, and the company says the future updates are also guaranteed. How awesome is that? </p>
<p> MicroSD card support – This might come as a sad news for the Moto G users, who are still stuck with the fixed internal storage and no option for expansion, but the future buyers of Moto E will have all the liberty to pop-in a MicroSD card (a maximum of 32GB) to expand the storage, if the 4GB internal (actually around 1.5GB available) isn’t enough. </p>
<p> The Motorola Shells – interchangeable back covers which come in 9 colors. You had to once select just between the White or Black options and had to settle with one for the entire time you are using it. Here, Motorola is giving the option to swap the back cover easily with some excellent color options. </p>
<p> The Motorola Apps that come pre-installed are quite enough for the users to start off with the new phone, and transfer all the content from their current smartphone. Just like what was in the earlier Motorola devices, the Moto G and Moto X. That’s the Moto Migrate function which transfers all the old content from your previous phone to the Moto E. </p>
<p> Finally, the 1980 mAh battery. Even the Moto G had a battery capacity of 2070 mAh and we were pretty happy with it. Pretty sure the Moto E would be providing longer hours of usage with the 1980 mAh capacity and the good optimization in the KitKat OS. </p>
<p> Competition from the other brands? no where near! </p>
<p> Having said all this, now, here’s why I feel this could turn around the game in the low-cost Android smartphone market – the competitor brands such as Samsung, HTC, Nokia, Sony have the entry-level devices in the market at this price point and none hold such neat specifications which the Moto E is coming with. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Trend from Samsung is priced at Rs. 6700 and it has a 4-inch WVGA display, Android Jelly Bean OS, 1GHz Processor with 512MB of RAM. </p>
<p> Nokia X was initially priced over Rs. 8000, but now has got a price drop, with the recent pricing of Rs. 6931, and it has some of the basic specs for the Nokia X platform – having a 1 GHz processor, 512MB RAM and a 3MP fixed focus camera. </p>
<p> The Sony Xperia E1 is priced at Rs. 7730, a little higher than what the Moto E is available for, but still, the phone comes with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean, 4-inch WVGA display, Snapdragon 200 processor and a 3MP camera. </p>
<p> HTC doesn’t have a decent phone under the price point of Rs. 8000. </p>
<p> All this would surely make the competition tougher for the other brands and Motorola emerges as a clear winner and the game changer. Every brand which has been doing well in the mid-range and high-end sector, will now rethink about a strategy to come up with decent budget smartphones with attractive pricing, or Motorola is clearly stealing things away from them. Same was the case when Moto G was introduced in the Indian market, wasn’t it? </p>

<p> Motorola Moto E Camera Samples & Camera App Interface </p>
<p> The Motorola Moto E looked good even when it was leaked, then the company pleasantly surprised everyone with the pricing and then the phone actually looked good in the hand. But not everything comes for cheap, is the message we get when we test the camera of the phone. The first thing everyone complained about, was the absence of flash to assist in dark conditions, but is the camera any good for the captures even in bright conditions? We didn’t find it so. </p>
<p> Firstly, the 5-megapixel shooter of the Moto E doesn’t come with good focusing options (as it is a fixed focus one) and the only thing you can adjust with your hand is the exposure. Thus, an object near to the phone won’t be focused well, and we tried it for multiple times and found it not that good. Secondly, the HDR mode might be helpful but that doesn’t click photos at the same pace as the normal capturing does, and while the HDR mode is on, the object shouldn’t be moving at all. </p>

<p> Moto E Camera App Interface </p>
<p> The camera app in the Moto E comes with a limited number of options, and these can be opened by swiping to the right from the left corner, and the options you get are: </p>
<p> Geotagging </p>
<p> The swiping to left from the right corner would open the gallery, and there is a toggle to switch between the photo and video mode. The editing options although would give us the different effects and options, but the actual camera app interface is easy to use. </p>
<p> The only disappointment is with the picture quality, which isn’t good at all. But one would ask, were you expecting better than this for the price you are paying? </p>

<p> Motorola Moto E Vs Micromax Unite 2 Budget Phone Comparison </p>
<p> Motorola Moto E is the kind of device that everyone wants to own. What does it lack? It runs on the latest Android OS, it has a dual core processor, has a 5 MP camera, a unique look with multiple colour back cover option and what not you get with this budget friendly device that is priced just at Rs. 6,999. Well the Indian based Smart Phone maker Micromax is not going to lose its grip in the affordable smartphone markets and in that process, it has come up with its Unite 2 Smart Phone that has similar specifications like the Moto E and is also priced the same. Let us compare these two devices and see which stands out to be better. </p>
<p> Design and Dimensions </p>
<p> Moto E measures 124.80 x 64.80 x 12.30 and weighs 140 grams which is easy enough for single hand operation and also fits into the pocket easily and also has the capacitive touchscreen buttons. The Micromax Unite 2 is fairly new device so the details about the dimensions and weight have not been mentioned. </p>
<p> Display </p>
<p> The Moto E has a 4.3 inch LCD display with the resolutions of 540 x 960 pixels resolutions giving and pixel density of 256 ppi. Moreover the screen of the device is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 that will keep it safe from scratches. The Motorola unite 2 has a bigger 4.7 inch IPS display with a lower resolutions of 480 x 800 as a result giving lower pixel density of 199 ppi. </p>
<p> Internal Specifications </p>
<p> The Motorola Moto E is powered by a Dual Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 chipset clocking at 1.2 GHz, where as the Unite 2 has a better Quad Core MediaTek MT6582 processor clocking almost at the same speed of 1.3 GHz. Both the devices will be running on the latest Android 4.4.2 KitKat Operating system and will also have the same 1 GB of RAM. </p>
<p> Camera / Storage </p>
<p> The Moto E has a 5 MP camera on the rear and it is disappointing that there is no flash support for it and moreover it also lacks the front facing camera. On the hand the Unite 2 has the same 5 MP camera but it has the LED flash support along with a 2 MP front facing camera. The lack of front camera in the Moto E pretty much a factor to be considered as you cannot make video calls or Skype calls. </p>
<p> Moto E comes with 4 GB of internal memory that can be expandable up to 32 GB via microSD card as it is in the case of the Micromax Unite 2. </p>
<p> 5 MP rear facing camera, No flash </p>
<p> 5 MP rear facing camera with LED flash </p>
<p> 4 GB internal memory, expandable up to 32 GB via microSD card </p>
<p> 4 GB internal memory, expandable up to 32 GB via microSD card </p>
<p> Connectivity/ Battery </p>
<p> Both these Smart Phone are 3G variant and will be supporting dual SIM (GSM + GSM) and dual standby. The battery on the Moto E is at 1980 mAh, while its competitor has a 2000 mAh battery on the back, so there is not a big difference in the battery powering these handsets. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Well we don’t have much to say about the pricing as both the devices are priced at Rs. 6,999 and with the quad core processor and a front camera Unite 2 is better option to go with. Many might be considering the Brand name as Motorola is an international brand that has delivered Smart Phones like the Moto G and Moto X that has created buzz in the market. But an important factor to consider in this, is that you cannot buy the Moto E in the local market unlike the Unite 2, because the Motorola phones are available only through Flipkart. </p>

<p> Motorola Moto E Unboxing, First Impressions & Photo Gallery </p>
<p> The much anticipated smartphone in the recent times, and the one which was launched at a surprisingly low price to beat every competitor in the market, the Moto E from Motorola is here. The phone comes with a total plain white panel on the back, and that is easily prone to get the discoloration from anything around, but at the same time, it won’t be wise to suggest a black variant only for this reason. </p>
<p> The 4.3-inch device looks premium even for that pricing, because of the build given by Motorola, just like it did for the Moto G and Moto X, and I’m not exaggerating when I say this is better than even the mid-range smartphones from Samsung in build and comfort. Externally, the phone doesn’t really have much except for the slots and buttons, and the 5MP camera lens which doesn’t have the flash assistance. </p>
<p> The Indian version of the Moto E comes with the hindi welcome and startup guide, at least better than the actual Indian brands which have never done much in the little details that would actually come to good use for the customer. The interface is good, just like the one in the Moto G because of the Android 4.4.2 KitKat OS in it, with the little list of pre-loaded applications, and the useful ones in them include Motorola Migrate, Assist and the Motorola Alert which might need the users to update it initially. </p>
<p> Check out the unboxing below, followed by the photo gallery to see how good the device looks in white color (we would be posting a gallery of the black one too, very soon). </p>
<p> Motorola Moto E Photo Gallery </p>
<p> What was in the box? There’s earphones, travel adapter, the Moto E startup guide in English & Hindi, Warranty information in both languages. </p>
<p> Do let us know if you have any question around this device, and we would be happy to answer them. For the initial impressions, this smartphone is very comfortable to hold and easy to use. We’d be posting the camera samples for you to see how good the capture quality is, for the 5MP lens that is provided. </p>
<p> Planning to buy one? you might have to wait for a few days after ordering but why not? here’s where you can get it – Moto E on Flipkart. </p>

<p> Motorola Moto G Google Play Edition Available Online from $179 on Play Store – Details </p>
<p> The Google Play Edition (GPE) for the Motorola Moto G is now available on the Google Play Store, finally, quite some time after it was launched in the market through the online stores. Although the smartphone is now available for the several countries, it says “Moto G Google Play is not available in your country” for the Indian users, so the Indian buyers will still have to wait for some more time until Motorola / Google makes it available for them. </p>
<p> The Google Play edition of the Moto G won’t be possibly carrying the Motorola’s additions to the Android 4.4.2 KitKat update that is already sent to the Moto G devices. The other advantage with the Play edition is that it would be receiving the latest Android updates at the same time as the other Play edition devices. the Moto G GPE would be having the same hardware as the GSM model which was launched last year, with the GSM/EDGE/GPRS 850/900/1800/1900MHz and 21Mbps HSPA+ 850/900/1900/21000MHz connectivity. The Android OS update will be based on the AOSP version of Android, and it would be receiving the faster updates without any skinning. </p>
<p> The Moto G Google Play Edition is going to be available for the price of $179 for the 8GB version and $199 for the 16GB version. There have always been a lot of fans for the GPE for the smartphones, mainly for the Android updates received by them. As for the specifications of the Moto G, check them below (although nothing is different from the one that was available last year). </p>

If you are in some other place, you will have to wait for the update to be rolled out anytime soon. </p>

<p> Motorola Moto G to be sold for $99.99 Off-Contract with Verizon – Confirmed via Leaked Memo </p>
<p> Best Buy is set to sell the Motorola Moto G for Verizon, for as low as $99.99 off-contract. Couple of days earlier, an employee from Best Buy leaked an image of the Verizon Moto G’s packing by posting it on his Google+ account and also mentioned that the phone will be costing $99.99 off-contract. The sales are going to start from January 9th. </p>
<p> Now the Moto G is selling at $99.99 at Best Buy as rumored earlier, without the customers having to sign-up for a new two-year contract with Verizon. We are not yet confirmed of which variant (8 GB or 16 GB) is going to be sold at $99.99 but normally the 8 GB variant will go for sale at $179 and the 16 GB variant with $199. </p>
<p> The phone is currently landing in stores and is available for sale as soon as it arrives, a spokesman (Jonathan Sandler) from Best Buy told The Times. </p>
<p> Best Buy is selling the Moto G in its retail stores, including the Best Buy Mobile stores, but for now even Best Buy is not taking online orders for the Moto G nor does the carrier Verizon on its website. At $99.99 the Moto G is one of the cheapest Smart Phones to go on sale in U.S. without a contract to be signed. The handset has arrived little earlier than expected from U.S. carriers. </p>
<p> Another image leak suggests that the phone would be on sale starting from January 9th at least from Best Buy, but we cannot take it as the official launch date as it could be changed. This handset will come with KitKat OS out of the box, pre-installed with some customizations. The back cover can be removed and exchanged for a different choice of the color for the customers. </p>
<p> Will the 4.5 inch HD screen device be your next device? For a mere $99.99 definitely it should be a pick for this New Year. Hopefully the device should be available online very soon. </p>

<p> Moto G Titan & Moto E Styx with 4G LTE Support & Quad Core SoC – Details </p>
<p> At Motorola, guards might have changed hands, but it seems like there is no affect what so ever when looked at the new range of smartphones. We have been hearing very strongly that in the latest MWC (Mobile World Congress) which is to be held in March will be displaying quite a few products not only from Motorola but also will be placing alongside the Lenovo too. In the latest, Moto G Titan and Moto E Styx are the 2 new smartphones which company will be coming out with very soon.

Along with the 155 grams of weight, this device will also come with the 8GB of internal memory along with the Quad core processor and an 8MP shooter at the back.

<p> Finally the Moto G is officially launched through Flipkart at a price of Rs 12499 for 8Gb & Rs 13,999 for the 16Gb Version which is a very good price considering that the imported unit was costing around Rs 18000-19000 range. Check out this link for more information on the pricing and also buy it today for the numerous goodies flipkart is going to offer to their customers. </p>
<p> Flipkart the official website selling the Moto G has informed that the product is not available right now but you can soon order it at 12:00 PM Indian Time at the special prices, which should probably be only available for a limited period. </p>
<p> Earlier : Motorola Moto G India Launch on February 5th – Buy from Flipkart on Jan 31, 2014. </p>
<p> The Motorola team once again keeps the fans involved but not totally happy with the new update, saying that the actual details about the launch of the Moto G smartphone in the Indian market are going to be announced on February 5th 2014. This is for the second time that Motorola has sent an update about the announcement but didn’t actually announce the device, after the promise in November 2013 that early January would be the time when the company releases the phone in the Indian market. </p>
<p> The official Facebook page of Motorola, posted an update saying: Moto G launch details for India will be announced on February 5. Stay tuned! </p>
<p> February 5th is not the date when Motorola will launch the Moto G, but is the day when they would just give the details about the availability, thus making another stretch of about a month easily from the day they announced earlier. The Australia, Malaysia and Dubai markets recently saw the launch of the Dual SIM versions of the Moto G, but there is no information about the variants that would be available in the Indian markets when it would be launched. </p>
<p> Apart from the launch date, the other concern for many interested buyers would be the pricing, as many were looking at this to be the next best budget Android device from a popular company, coming straight from under the eyes of Google, which makes it further interesting. The Moto G was launched in US with the price set at $179, and just a few days back, the Moto G Google Play Edition was also launched for the same price. A leaked memo recently even claimed that Verizon might sell the Moto G for $99.99 off-contract, but for now it hasn’t become a reality. </p>
<p> The Moto G comes with the 4.5-inch HD display and it is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor clocking at 1.2 GHz and there is 1GB RAM to support it. The phone has a 5-megapixel rear camera and a 1.3-megapixel front camera and has the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean running, but out-of-the-box there would be Android 4.4.2 KitKat update available for it. </p>

The rear camera would be of 3.2-megapixel quality with LED flash, and there would be a front facing VGA camera for video chatting. The battery in the Defy Mini would be a better one than in the Motoluxe, as it has a 1650 mAh battery. </p>

<p> (Now Spotted in White) Motorola Moto X Release Date – 1st August [Press Shots Included] </p>
<p> Motorola is going to hold an event in New York on August 1st, which would mark the unveiling of the highly anticipated Moto X device, which was since quite a long time into several rumors, expectations and leaks. Hold your thoughts right there if you were to buy a new high-end smartphone, as the tag of a stable OS still goes with the flagship devices, and the announcement of the latest one is just 10 days from now. It can be well worthy of competing with the other best smartphones right now, the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the HTC One. </p>
<p> Apart from the invite sent by Motorola for the unveiling, we have also got the press shots that were leaked around, and first seen on theunlockr.com, one of the sources with Evleaks, whose many leaks and rumors are almost true. It’s the similar one which Google chairman Eric Schmidt was caught using it. </p>
<p> There’s no doubt about the stability of the OS because the flagship phones are the one which receive any new OS version and that too after its reached perfection following tests, and they are the ones which get any newer updates before the other devices. Motorola being a part of Google now, would be taking up all the resources from Google in making this new smartphone and that’s what would impress most of us. </p>
<p> A web page linked to the invitation said “Come experience the new Motorola. No Stage. No crowds.”, and it has got several sessions of which the user can select one, to attend the unveiling. Earlier the company had said that the entire device is going to be made in the United States. If we are to talk about the rumored specs of the Moto X, there would be more of a disappointment than any excitement because there’s nothing big related to the device that is known to come, but that is just rumors and we do not know what is officially coming in the end. Check back on 1st August when the new flagship devices makes its entry into the Android world. </p>

<p> Motorola Moto X 2nd Gen 2014 – Hands On & Initial Impressions </p>
<p> The smartphone that you will remember as soon as you hear the word customization, is the Moto X that was the flagship device of Motorola for the year 2013. This year the company has retained the same name for its 2014 flagship, and has called it the Moto X (2nd gen). We know that Motorola tasted huge success with its Moto G and Moto X last year, and it will be hoping to repeat the same this year. Although Moto G this year cannot make the kind of buzz that it made last year because of the heavy competition in its price range, Motorola will be hoping that Moto X 2014 will be making some impact. </p>
<p> This year the Moto X comes with many smart features that we have seen with its predecessor and many new features also. This year’s flagship from Motorola will come with a 5.2 inch AMOLED touchscreen display over the 4.7 inch display of its predecessor. Even the resolution has been improved, and we can see the 1080p screen now. The device is powered by a Snapdragon 801 processor with a clocking speed of 2.5 GHz and will be accompanied with 2 GB of RAM and Adreno 330 GPU. This device also supports 4G LTE connectivity. </p>
<p> The On-board memory of the device is 16/32 GB as the device is available in two different variants, but it is disappointing that even this device from Motorola does not feature a microSD card slot. There is a 2300 mAh battery on the back of the device and will run the latest Android Operating System out of the box. Moreover, since the company is taken over by Google, the device will run almost Stock Android and will be among the first devices to get a Google update. There is a 13 MP front facing camera with Dual LED and is also capable of taking 4K videos, as well as slow-mo videos. </p>
<p> 5.2 inch FHD AMOLED screen with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 </p>
<p> Coming to the design of the device, the Moto X is 9.97 thick with the dimensions of 140.8mm x 72.4mm x 9.97mm and weighs 144 grams. At the front side there a 2 MP camera just beside the earpiece and there are on-screen buttons at the bottom. The bezels are thin on the sides and at the bottom you can also find a speaker. To the right of the device we can find the power and volume rocker buttons and at the top there is a 3.5 mm audio jack beside the SIM slot. At the bottom side, there is a USB slot to transfer data and also to power the device. Over-all the device is pretty good in the hand and also gives you the royal and elegant look with its metallic sides. On the back, there is a 13 MP camera with Motorola’s Ring Flash, and there is also the company’s branding. The back cover of the device cannot be removed, so the SIM slot is given at the top. </p>
<p> The Moto X that we are using is a Black colour variant and will be coming in either 16 GB or 32 GB variants. This device will be coming into the market and will be competing with flagship devices like Samsung Galaxy S5, Sony Xperia Z3, HTC M8 and many other devices. Finally as for my initial impressions, the device is decent enough with its elegance and many smart features. We will be using this device for few days becoming up with a full review. The can be customised with the motomaker and is also water resistant. </p>

<p> Motorola Moto X Customization for Verizon, T-mobile, Sprint Now Available – with Engraving </p>
<p> The Moto X customization was what had attracted many fans who wanted to have some colorful and different back panels than the standard white or black colors for most of the smartphones around. It was an AT&T exclusive for a lot of time now, but finally the Moto Maker website shows this possible for the other networks too – T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint and it includes both the 16 GB and the 32 GB models. Along with the color options for the front, back panels and the buttons, the Moto Maker has included the Engraving option for the back panel. </p>
<p> The options are the same as in the AT&T customization earlier, as the users can select from the 18 colors and the black/white front color, seven Accent colors which would show up on the power and volume buttons, as well as on the ring around the rear camera lens. The other things that you can do along with the color changes, include: </p>
<p> Engrave your name or short message on the back panel </p>
<p> Add a name or short message to the boot icon </p>
<p> Select the default wallpaper </p>
<p> Pre-sync the Moto X with your Google account </p>
<p> The engraving would be possible on the bottom area on back panel, and if you don’t get anything engraved, it would be the carrier logo shown at the same place, and it wouldn’t be an empty space. </p>
<p> For the customers of AT&T, Verizon and Sprint can get the Moto X on contract for $99.99 on contract, and the unsubsidized model for $499.99. The T-mobile users cannot get this on contract and can purchase only the unsubsidized model through Moto Maker. It’s good to see that the 32GB version too is available, but you will have to shell out $50 more on both the on-contract and off-contract purchases. </p>
<p> Moto X Pricing via Moto Maker </p>
<p> Verizon, AT&T & Sprint – 16GB – $99.99 on contract, $499.99 unsubsidized </p>

<p> Motorola Moto X Touchless Control App Gets Update : Speak PIN to Unlock </p>
<p> The Touchless control app is the latest update for the Motorola, which is one of the best features of the Moto X. but this time it is something more than a bug-fix. This updated application lets you unlock the phone by just saying your PIN number and also allows for more commands to work while your phone is locked. </p>
<p> You can make a quick Phone call without unlocking the device or even search for Google directly. You can just simply speak the PIN number and the device will automatically unlock itself and be ready for use. This update has to be enabled manually after the updation of the application. However this app will only work with the Handsets running on Android 4.4. </p>
<p> Important features: </p>
<p> Work without having to unlock your phone with more Google commands. </p>
<p> Personal information such as emails, messages, documents, images and contacts are protected by the PIN or password </p>
<p> By using Touchless Control, say your PIN to unlock the device </p>
<p> New listening tone when you say OK Google Now </p>
<p> Runs only with Andriod 4.4 KitKat </p>
<p> Bug fixes. </p>
<p> It is going to be a great update when you are not connected with a Bluetooth device and you need not unlock the phone by the PIN every time you access the phone for smaller functions. But there are not many devices that are running on Android 4.4, which is a let down to the android users. The users of Moto Xs can update this application right now from the Google play store. </p>
<p> Last Update Nov 25th 2013 Motorola has been very quick in sending up the firmware updates to their customers and on the same lines they have announced today that the Android 4.4 Kitkat is rolling out. For now its limited to the verizon version of the Moto X but soon it would also be available for other MOTO X Users. This is a surprising news because officially the Nexus 4 owners are still waiting for Kitkat while MotoX Users can experience this new version of the Android OS. </p>
<p> It comes with a big list of enhancements which includes the following : </p>
<p> Improved Phone Dialer : The new dialer on the MotoX comes with a option to search your contacts from the dial-pad and you can easily tap on the frequently contacted contacts. </p>
<p> Better Gallery : The New Kitkat update brings in some interesting and useful gallery effects like Edges, Highlights and Posterize along with the option to annotate the photos freehand with your fingers with the Draw Feature. </p>
<p> New Hangouts App : You can not only send text messages, make video calls and perform chats but also send animated gif’s and also share your location with this new application. </p>
<p> Color emojis : For when words aren’t enough, the Google Keyboard now includes colorful characters to send in text messages and other communications. </p>
<p> Better Camera App : The new app allows you to control the exposure and focus of your photos and you can simply drag to set the focus point and set the right exposure. </p>
<p> NFC – Host card emulation : Enhanced support for NFC Host Card Emulation (HCE), to improve experiences such as contactless payments, loyalty plans, transit passes, card access and more. </p>
<p> Along with this the most important feature ie the Touchless Control and the navigation bars are enhanced along with a restyled status and new full screen mode on this device.

<p> Earlier – Motorola Moto X+1 render surfaces as Motorola Victara – Leaked Picture & Details – June 25th, 2014 </p>
<p> After Moto X, we have been hearing the news about its successor Motorola Moto X+1. Earlier many rumors excited us and now the first render of the device has surfaced and it has been leaked by @evleaks. Leaks suggested that the device will be coming with 25 custom backplates and Moto X+1 placeholder also appeared last month on Moto Maker website and the devices was showed up on official website for AT&T. </p>
<p> The image does not reveal much about the device but shows the camera on the back along with two microphones. We couldn’t spot the flash on the back that creates a doubt. Nothing much about the device is known for now but according to the earlier leaks the device will be featuring a 1080p screen and the device is called with the codename Victara. The shell we see is a DualPro Hard shell case and it is coming to Verizon carrier. </p>
<p> Earlier – Motorola Moto X Successor Moto X+1 to Launch Soon, says Evleaks – Specs, Details – May 20th, 2014 </p>
<p> Motorola that has surprised everyone with the pricing of its recent Smartphones Moto X and Moto G is prepared to launch its flagship model that will be the successor to the Moto X smartphone that was released last year. According to the prolific leaker @evleaks Moto X+1 is the upcoming smartphone from the company that is codenamed Victara will be the upcoming flagship device. @evleaks also said that the device will be sold by all the four major carriers from US. </p>
<p> The Moto X+1 will be available through Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile. Although the Moto E came up with a low price of $129, we cannot expect the same for this flagship device. This device will be featuring back panels options like what we have seen in the Moto X that will include the wood and leather. Motorola mobility is about to be acquired by Lenovo as it agreed to by it from Google for almost $3 billion. </p>
<p> Earlier – Motorola Moto X Successor Moto X+1 rumored with a Leather back – Specs, Details – April 8th, 2014 </p>
<p> Motorola Moto X that was a huge success is reportedly going to have a successor, named as Moto X+1. Motorola came back to India with its Moto G as well as the Moto X Android smart phones which gave them a huge success. The company was acquired by Lenovo before which it was owned by Google. Now the company is rumored to be working Moto X+1 according to the prolific leaker on Twitter, @evleaks. </p>
<p> According to the leaks the successor of the Moto X will be coming with a leather back which was not seen on the Moto X in spite of all its back cover customizations. This is the first time that we will be seeing a Motorola device with leather back and we all know that the company is well known for trying out different materials for the back of its device. </p>
<p> Earlier Moto X was launched in 2013 in the month of August with a 4.7 inch display with 720 x 1280 pixel resolutions. The device is powered by 1.7 GHz dual core Qualcomm MSM8960Pro Snapdragon processor coupled with 2 G of RAM. More over it will be running on the latest Android 4.4 KitKat Operating System and has a 10 MP shooter at the rear with LED flash and 2 MP sensor on the front. </p>
<p> It also comes with many other interesting features like controlling the device with voice commands or just twist the wrist twice to open the camera and also the flip to silent mode. It also responds to the voice commands just by saying Whats up (upgrade to the Motorola Touchless Control) and all the new notifications will be read out to you. </p>
<p> The specifications and other information’s of the device are not known yet but should be getting all those in the near future from the company. Stay tuned for more information and updates. </p>

<p> Why Motorola MotoX is a Fail with Current Pricing – Compared to Galaxy S4 & iPhone 5 </p>
<p> Motorola has finally launched the Moto X Smart Phone which can be considered as the most leaked handset of the year. After so many leaks finally we got to know that the device comes in 504 different variants and its possible to customize each unit by engraving your name onto the same. This was a interesting step from Motorola post-acquisition by Google but I think that they have failed in terms of the pricing. </p>
<p> After the announcement of the product, it was mentioned that the color customization options would be only available on AT&T, while the device would still be available on all the US carriers and no updates on the availability in other countries. It would be available at a price of $199 on contract which is fine because most of the Smart Phones launched are generally priced in the range of $99 to $199 under contract while atleast 2-3 times when you purchase the same off-contract. In this case Motorola has also announced that the product would be available off the contract at a price of $575 for the 16 Gb version while the 32 Gb model to be priced at $629. Now considering that this is not a top notch product from Motorola when compared with the Samsung Galaxy S4 or the iPhone 5, the pricing seems ridiculous and you can read below to know more on this. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S4 – $600 Click for Price on Amazon 16 Gb Internal Storage / 5″ Super AMOLED Display / 440 PPI / 2600 maH Battery Capacity </p>
<p> Apple iPhone 5 – $694 Click for Price on Amazon 16 Gb Internal Storage / 4.5″ Retina Display / 326 PPI / 1440 maH Battery Capacity </p>
<p> Motorola MotoX – $575 16 Gb Internal Storage / 4.7″ AMOLED Display / 316 PPI / 2200 maH Battery Capacity </p>
<p> High Priced – Decent Hardware </p>
<p> Considering that there is not much different in the pricing when you opt for the Non-Contract unit, if you still plan to buy this unit you need to make a note that it comes with 720p HD Display unlike the 1080p HD display which is found on other flagship smart phones. The MotoX is clearly not a top end device, but a product which comes with few options which can generally be opted with third party accessories itself like the backpanels which are not that unique. </p>
<p> Its not a premium device like the HTC One, Galaxy S4 or the iPhone 5, but the pricing is premium which is something Motorola should work on, if they would like to get a better market share. The Nexus 4 from LG was a hit to the extent that it was not available because of the demand and this was mainly because of the competitive / discounted pricing through the play store which is not yet available in the case of MotoX. </p>
<p> Play Edition </p>
<p> There are already rumors that the device would be listed on the Play Store at a price of just $349 which would be very interesting but again the most unique features of this device would be removed if thats the case. If purchased through a carrier then it would not only come with the features but also the bloatware, while the Play Edition would just be the hardware with the Stock Android and quicker updates. </p>
<p> What’s your Choice? </p>
<p> Considering all the options – Contract Price of 16Gb at $199, 32 Gb at $249 through AT&T, Unlocked Price of 16Gb at $575, 32 Gb at $629 and the Play Store pricing of $349 which one would you opt for and why? Also do you think that the price of the Moto X is justified for what it offers? Do you really think that the panel’s changing and customization option is something unique or is it just a small bonus which is not worth the money. Let us know in the comments section below. </p>

<p> HTC launched Desire 600 with specs similar to Quattro but with Good looks and hiked the price by 10K INR … I thought bad move but strange enough people still end buying it even when there are better performing and good looking mobiles ….. like Google Nexus 4. Moto X seems to be on the same path … I reckon that with a kind of mobile they are blessed with … a right pricing could do wonders for them.. but alas … I do not see that happening. </p>
<p> i am waiting for this device but after checking price i had changed my mind 18k in india is not bad price for moto x in india there is more option compatiotor to this phone like lenovo k900 or k910 & pantech upcoming model </p>
<p> You are correct. I would not pay a penny over $369 for this phone and probably not that much. </p>
<p> The GPU of Moto X outperforms the Galaxy S4 and its CPU is on par with all the high end phones. How come it’s hardware is still a decent one? </p>

<p> Motorola Moto X Review – Features, Performance & Camera </p>
<p> Finally, the device that has been the most famous despite not having the best of the specs, is in my hands and I am loving it already. Finally, there’s no huge screen, finally there’s some real personalization and finally, something away from the standard designs and panels of the smartphones, the Moto X has arrived and we’ve got the International retail package to review. Is the Moto X worth the price? does the specs make the user feel it’s enough for their usage? let’s see below. </p>
<p> Update: The Moto X is now available on Flipkart for the price of Rs. 23,999 – Click here to buy. </p>
<p> Design, Form Factor & Display </p>
<p> Could majorly be a reason that I had become a fan of the device since it’s announcement, but still I like the Moto X after the overload of the devices with the 5-inch and 5+ inch screen sizes, which don’t deserve the tag of a smartphone but something else. In fact, we saw most of the big brands coming up with the devices keeping 5-inch screens as a standard, when the Galaxy S4, HTC One, Xperia Z were launched, and none of them looked at what the users might be asking for, but they were all into the competition in the same league. 4.7-inch is really quite enough, when you get a good AMOLED HD display, with the pixel density of 316 PPI. In fact, the iPhone 5 whose display too is well known around, has got a similar density of pixels with the 326 PPI. </p>
<p> Yes I would be missing the 1080p display which I got used to, in the flagship Galaxy and others, but does a normal user take advantage of the perfect display all the time by watching movies, captured videos? they would care more about the RAM, heating up and the battery while watching and that’s where the display quality doesn’t matter and even a 720p display looks quite enough. </p>
<p> When you hold the HTC One and Moto X side by side, it would be easy to see why the Moto X is getting so much appreciation. There’s no much wasted space on the sides of the screen, and thus although the lesser screen size, the Moto X looks too small and far more comfortable. </p>
<p> The front side of the Moto X has the AMOLED display, and just over it, the thin earpiece and the set of sensors just left to it, pushing the front cam to the right top corner. Just below to the screen is the mic, appropriately placed but that looks a little different, as most of the smartphones have got it at the bottom panel, and the space where this mic is, is taken by the touch sensitive buttons. </p>
<p> The back looks excellent, and that is what is going to keep the buzz going for the users because there are hundreds of color and panel options that you are going to get in the Moto Maker website while ordering the phone. The one we have is the standard white one with the matte-cloth look but it’s smooth and that’s a sticker from top to bottom, which although is smooth, provides a little friction preventing the slipping from hands. </p>
<p> The Moto X looks quite solid although the material that is said to be used is composite, but why would one want to risk it and test the fall and break? it could be quite sensitive if seen that way. The screen, back panel are all well resistant to the fingerprints and dust. </p>
<p> Internal Powering, Performance & Software </p>
<p> Applause for the 2GB of RAM, that’s where the Google’s proper concern about the user experience starts. Many would ask, is it a computer for that much RAM? but that’s what is needed when you are using some heavy apps in the background and playing a good memory using game on the front. It’s just a Dual-core processor though, which one would be really concerned about, and the processor clocks at the speed of 1.7 GHz. </p>
<p> The Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro CPU comes along with a quad-core Adreno 320 GPU and along with these, there are two low-power processors which are dedicated for the natural language and the contextual computing. In the end there’s a lot of cores, but the final question would be – Is it strong enough to run without lags? A couple of hours of testing resulted in no lags, it was all quick with some active apps but that won’t be our final conclusion. It’s just the start and the actual issues usually start after we install some heavy gaming apps and play around with the device for a few days. In the end you are bound to use the device for months or years, right? </p>
<p> When you expect a speed just like what you see in the Galaxy S4 or the HTC One, and you actually see it in the device having a Dual-core processor, that’s quite fascinating. </p>
<p> Software side, it’s Android 4.2.2 where one would have expected to see the Android 4.3 (the latest right now) right out of the box as the Moto X just started shipping, but the stock Android of 4.2.2 version doesn’t disappoint at all, and the 4.3 didn’t come with any interface changes anyways, as it was some improvement in the performance and support for the Bluetooth 4.0 low energy. </p>
<p> The Apps that you get to see in the stock ROM, include the basic Google ones, and apart from that the Assist, Migrate apps would come handy in enhancing the experience of the user in assisting in different functions like driving etc., and to migrate the data, contacts etc. from any other devices. </p>
<p> Touchless Control – An Apple Siri Competitor </p>
<p> This one gets a special mention, for what it provides and recognizes. Of course the personal assistant you get in the Moto X fails to recognize the accent of an Indian English talking person, we are fine with it and with the American English accent, the response is awesome. It first records your voice when you activate it for the first time, and then keeps it in the memory and recognizes only that same voice when said “Ok Google Now” followed by the command. </p>
<p> The things you can do using the Touchless Control includes the following: </p>
<p> Navigate instantly: For directions to any particular place </p>
<p> Calling your friends by mentioning name and the type: home, mobile </p>
<p> Ask and get Google to search and answer it </p>
<p> The assistant would also make calls for you even when the screen is locked. One of the best advantages with this is, that even Siri needed the user to press the Home button to activate it. But here, when the screen is locked, you just need to say “Ok Google Now” and it would promptly respond to it. </p>
<p> Camera – Front and Back Lens, Capture Comparison </p>
<p> We’ve seen the 13 MP sensors from the Galaxy S4, the new “Ultrapixel” camera in the HTC One, the waterproof 13-megapixel one in the Xperia Z, but now it’s something else in the Moto X – the “Clear Pixel technology” powered 10-megapixel camera. It’s basically something to do with the throwing of light in the photos, and here’s a competitor to the Lumia devices which claim to have the best low-light photography cameras and it’s where the Samsung Galaxy S4, HTC One and Xperia Z doesn’t hold an authority. </p>
<p> The camera of the Moto X has got the RGBC where C means Clear. According to the smartphone maker, there are two advantages with the camera – 75% more light in the photos, and 2x the capturing speed when compared to the other high-end smartphone cameras, combined with the F/2.4 in the Moto X camera. We’ve tested it and the photos are quite good at quality but the speed of the camera captures would need more time for testing because it would be too soon to say that the camera capture and response is blazing fast. </p>
<p> Now, when we actually test the cameras of the Moto X with that of the Galaxy S4, it’s the Galaxy S4 which impresses us but we are yet to do a dark-room capture to see which one is better. </p>
<p> Moto X vs Galaxy S4 Camera Comparison </p>
<p> There’s a lot more the camera of the Moto X can do, with the High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode, Tap to Focus and Capture, Slow Motion Video capturing, Panorama capture, Geotagging, easy toggle for Shutter sound, Quick Capture (an interesting mode where you need to twist your wrist twice to quickly launch the camera anytime). </p>
<p> Both the back and front cameras are able to capture videos at 1080p Full HD quality, and the 1080p with the front camera is just a number as you wouldn’t get what is said with the number there. The 1080p HD video recording with the rear camera is excellent, and the slow motion video recording too is an added neat feature which was well appreciated in the Galaxy Camera from Samsung, and most of the other smartphone cameras haven’t provided that feature, basically for those who wanted to have some fun capturing slo-mo videos. </p>
<p> Battery & Benchmarks </p>
<p> The battery doesn’t ask much and initially you don’t have to optimize the device at all to save the battery, because it’s the Super AMOLED screen which doesn’t eat up much battery at least in this device, and thus we saw the battery serving the device on normal usage for more than a day. It’s the 2200mAh battery which is not at all less, and luckily you have the 4.7-inch display and a dual-core processor which is to be used, and not some higher-end ones, so the battery should be quite enough. </p>
<p> For the benchmarking, the score is 20k+ and it keeps itself in the top league, just below a few real good high-end devices such as the HTC One, Samsung Galaxy S4 etc. but I wasn’t expecting the scores to be anywhere more than 15000 in the AnTuTu benchmark test. </p>
<p> Final Verdict – Is the Moto X worth it? </p>
<p> In the entire review above, you might have noticed a lot of praises, and a few factors where we said that you shouldn’t expect it to be more than this, but there’s one thing where Moto X did get criticized – Pricing of the Moto X for the unlocked device. And while we extend that, the price for the locked one too is $200, which is quite a bit high because when you have the Galaxy S4, HTC One at the lpricing with so much to provide, Moto (or Google) should have kept it at a $100 range. </p>
<p> Still, once Motorola decides to extend the customization to more than just AT&T, we would love to recommend this because this was my personal favorite as soon as the wooden panels were showcased, but it was disappointing when the Moto Maker offered this only for the AT&T subscribers. Overall, this one is an excellent smartphone which is not the best with the specs, but provides what an actual consumer would want from a neat Android smartphone. </p>

<p> There are very less chances of it getting launched in India, and yes it should work if its the unlocked device. </p>

<p> Motorola schedules MWC 2014 Event on February 25th – No new Device Expected </p>
<p> Motorola schedules an event for February at the MWC 2014 (Mobile World Congress) after is success in India with the debut of its Moto G. Motorola is now owned by the Chinese manufacturer, Lenovo that was before owned by Google which in turn managed to bring out two near stock Android Smartphones, the Moto G made for emerging market and Moto X was specially made for the US. </p>
<p> Google sold Motorola Mobility to Lenovo for a price of $2.91 billion which the software giant acquired for $12.5 billion back in 2012. Since the company was purchased by Google, it’s been slow with hardware rollouts, releasing only five major phone models in the last year and there was not much profit to both the companies (Google and Motorola). CEO Dennis Woodside will be at the event to provide an update on Motorola’s business, as well as other future plans or the acquisition by Lenovo. Moto says that more details will be revealed as we get closer to Feb. 25. </p>
<p> We need to wait till the 25th of this month to know what Motorola has packed for the event and we should be surprised if it comes up with any launches. Earlier we saw the Motorola coming back to Indian with its Moto G running on Android Operating System with the 16 GB variant priced at Rs. 13,999 and the 8 GB version priced at Rs. 12,499. We can also expect Motorola to bring its flagship, Moto X to the Indian market after its success with the Moto G. </p>
<p> Do you own any of the devices from Motorola? Are you happy with the acquisition of Motorola by Lenovo or feel that it was going better with Google itself? Stay tuned for more information and updates as we will be heading to the MWC this year to bring you live updates on all the launches and releases. </p>

<p> Motorola Officially allows Bootloader Unlocking of Android Devices in 4 Steps </p>
<p> For long period of time you might have heard the term bootloader! For those who aren’t aware, they can understand what is Bootloader and its purpose? Its nothing but a program which controls all the applications which runs at the startup of your phone. </p>
<p> After HTC and Asus roadways to the make the bootloader unlock available officially, it turned out to be Motorola Mobility who has announced the availability of ‘Unlock My Device’ exclusively page where you can unlock the bootloader in four easy steps. This has just started by Motorola and we might see many more devices coming added in future. Right now only Sprint Photon Q 4G LTE is the supported device. </p>
<p> Motorola highly warns users not to unlock their bootloaders for the users who aren’t aware of Android SDK. Unlocking your device will allow you to make modifications to your device which can easily damage the device. But before you proceed to unlock the bootloaders check whether you have installed the fastboot and the Android SDK, install the latest Motorola USB drivers. You should also verify that your fastboot recognizes your device as well. </p>
<p> Also users should understand that if you proceed with unlocking of the bootloader,s your warranty will get void and neither Motorola nor the wireless carrier will be held responsible for this harmful act. Make sure that if you proceed with the bootloaders unlocking, your apps, internal storage data, media all will be reset and you need to take the backup by whichever method you do it. </p>
<p> Supported Devices </p>
<p> Not all the devices support unlocking of the boot loader under the Unlock my Device program. </p>
<p> As of now the support is only available for the Sprint Photon Q 4G LTE smart phone and in the coming weeks we might see more devices added available for unlocking. Expected devices are the Motorola Razr, Xoom and Xoom Wi Fi. </p>

<p> Motorola releases Refreshed Gallery App for Moto X, Moto G and 2013 Droid Phones – Details </p>
<p> Motorola releases its new stock Gallery app to the Google Play Store with new features like larger thumbnails while viewing the photos, faster navigation with new design. Motorola has taken to the Google Play Store to distribute updates to its stock apps that appeared on the Moto X, Moto G and the newest Android devices. </p>
<p> Earlier Motorola used the Play Store to distribute its updates of the stock apps that included the camera, Assist and Touchless Control. With the new Gallery app the devices will be getting the newer White UI (User Interface) that was mostly black theme. This new app will feature a slide out navigation panel instead of the dropdown list, letting the users to shift between camera roll, timeline and album view. </p>
<p> This also hides the status bar from view and the navigation bar stays out (removed some of the view options) including Photos, Timeline and albums. This Gallery app also includes Locations and Tags, giving the feel somewhat similar to the Google+ Photo app that is installed on the phones, but it won’t provide any cloud backup! Earlier the users got only the share option on the photo but now it includes the Edit and Delete options also making it easier for the users. </p>
<p> Unfortunately this app won’t be available for other older version of Motorola devices, the app looks quite good with the new whiter UI and we also know that Google is planning to replace the stock Android gallery app with Google+ Photos. So let’s see till when this update would last as Motorola is also from the Google division. </p>
<p> The application is available in the Google Play store now, but only for the users of Moto G, 2013 Android devices or Moto X running on KitKat OS. So what are you waiting for? Get this app downloaded and if you have already downloaded it let us know your experience on it. Stay with us for more information and updates. </p>

<p> Motorola Xoom Price Drop in US & Taiwan Tablet Markets </p>
<p> Finally Motorola could not continue with their over priced tablets and have lowered the prices of their Tablets in Taiwan & America. The Xoom is considered to be one of the Best Android Tablets which you could buy. Earlier the 32GB Wi-Fi-enabled Xoom tablets were sold at $599 which are now $100 lower being offered at $499 while the same is dropped from NT$19,800 (NT$687) to NT$16,900 in the local Taiwan Market. </p>
<p> There are many speculations that the price drop is because of the launch of Eee Pad tablets from Asustek computers at just $399 which could be a real threat for their product range. It’s expected that most of these tablet vendors are soon going to drop their prices because the iPad 3 is around the corner and if it’s launched at a lower price, all of them would see a bad sales figure. </p>
<p> We expect Galaxy Tab, Acer Iconia and other tablets to soon reduce their prices in this quarter and its suggested to currently not buy any of these if you would like to save your hard-earned money. There are also rumors that the Motorola Xoom 2 would be soon launched which could also be a reason for this price drop. Whatever could be the reason, the competition in market always helps the consumers. </p>

<p> Motorola Xoom has dual LED, 5 MP rear camera. Galaxy Tab is lightweight and has better display. Xoom has better SD card support. Xoom UI is better than Galaxy Tab UI. Xoom will get Google future OS updates quicker than Galaxy Tab. </p>
<p> I purchased the Xoom from a Verizon store in Oct. 2011. It came with 4 G and updated OS. I love this tablet and cannot imagine a better option. I have IPad owners as well as other owners of non-xoom tablets use my Xoom and everyone has suffered from buyer’s remorse. I have played games, surfed the net, accessed emails, watched TV, movies and sports on my xoom and it has been great. I also have a blue tooth connected key board that makes typing on word documents easy. I downloaded a word compatible App which allows me to edit and create documents that I am able to save on Google docs. I would recommend this to anyone. In fact, my 22 and 18 year old use this anytime they can get it from me over their Mac (son) and PC (daughtet) laptops. </p>

<p> This would be one of the toughest competitors to the iPad. We always had the Samsung Galaxy Tab in mind, but this device is far better with the specifications. The 5MP camera with 720p quality video recording, the front facing 2MP camera which is great for video conferencing. I have always been admiring the interface of the Honeycomb when I first saw the video launched by Google. </p>

<p> Motorola XT912A Spotted in Benchmark Test with Android 4.4.3 – Specs, Details </p>
<p> Motorola that got recognized globally with its Moto G and Moto X has already confirmed that they would be introducing the successor of the Moto X later this year along with few other smart phones and nothing else was revealed about them. Motorola is coming up with another smart phone that was spotted in the GFXBench test and it is Motorola XT912A. </p>
<p> According to the benchmark tests the device will be running on the latest Android 4.4.3 and will be having a 5.2 inch display with 1080 x 1920 pixel resolutions and will be powered by a quad core Snapdragon 800 processor clocking at 2.26 MHz coupled with 2 GB of RAM and Adreno 330 GPU. The battery on the device is not mentioned and we can expect it to be somewhere around 2300 mAh to 3000 mAh. </p>
<p> The device will be having a 12 MP shooter at the front with LED flash and is also capable of taking full HD video recording and also has the options like autofocus, face detection, flash, HDR photo and touch focus. This rear camera is accompanied with 2 MP 1080p camera on the front. The on-board memory of the device will be 32 GB out of with 27 GB is user memory similar to what we have seen in Moto X and it also has NFC connectivity. </p>
<p> This XT912A model number is similar to the one that we have seen the Motorola Droid Razr that was released in late 2011 by Verizon had a model number as XT912. We can’t go entirely on the leaked specifications from the benchmark test as many of them turn up to be a fake. Motorola is expected to unveil the Moto E which will be a variant of the Moto G Smart phone that is a big success in the market. Let see how when this XT912A will be officially announced and is it the successor of the Moto X? Well let’s wait and see. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Get Moto X Active Display Features on Any Android 4.3 Smart Phone </p>
<p> We know you would be wanting to have the awesome features of the Moto X in your Android smartphone rather than having the phone itself which came in with two amazing things – Interface, Design. Everything else looks quite low when compared to the other best smartphones in the league. So, there’s an option for those who wanted to have the Active Display features of the Moto X on their smartphones, but the device has to be on the latest Android 4.3 Jelly Bean version to use that app. </p>
<p> ActiveNotifications is the application we are talking about, which brings some excellent changes and features to the lock screen, making each notification worth noticing, and easier to open directly from the lock screen. With Motorola working more on the user experience than the specs, the Active Display seems to be a good feature for the users who like to be connected to the web all the time. The ActiveNotifications does the similar job for the other devices. Instead of unlocking the screen and activating the display, you can directly, in short, check the notifications such as the SMS, Gmail mails, Facebook notifications and for the apps which you select. </p>
<p> There’s Premium Features too </p>
<p> Sometimes, not everything comes for free, and the same applies here because the App does provide some basic features for free but you need to pay $0.99 if you want to have Premium features such as: </p>
<p> Sleep at night – Don’t show any notifications at night at specified time range </p>
<p> More privacy – Hides additional notification details, such as the text of SMS, sender name etc. </p>
<p> Switch off the screen automatically when notifications are dismissed </p>
<p> To make you understand about what is changed and how you can access the notification, here’s how the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4 had the unlocking option – Swipe to the right for Unlock, Swipe to the left for any shortcut. But now with this app, you need to: </p>
<p> Swipe below to unlock the screen </p>
<p> Swipe above to check the notification and open the app </p>
<p> Swipe to left or right to dismiss the notification </p>
<p> You can select any applications whose notifications you choose to show on the lock screen, and the premium features as listed above would come handy if you are planning to use this app for a good time ahead and take full advantage of it. </p>
<p> To download the app, you can either go to the Play Store and install the app from there, or check below for the download link for the APK file which you could install on your device locally. </p>
<p> If at all while installing the APK file on your device, you see a parsing error, the most common reason for that could be the Android version compatibility, and you need to ensure that your device is running on Android 4.3, because this app wouldn’t run on the previous Android versions. Why just Android 4.3 and not the earlier versions? It is because of the “NotificationListenerService” feature which is being used by the app, and this feature is a part of only the latest Android version. </p>

<p> Moto X Bamboo Customization Finally Available via Moto Maker for $100 Extra </p>
<p> The Moto X Bamboo customization on the back, which got the device a lot of buzz during the announcement, is finally available on the Moto Maker website, and this customization comes with a price tag of $100, and would make the actual price of the device as $199 along with the 2-year contract with the different network providers. </p>
<p> The back panel is not just the only thing you can change and personalize, as you can have the colors you wish, for the side buttons and the rim around the camera lens, the front area around the bezel, and you can include a signature of yours for the back panel. </p>
<p> The Moto Maker is also selling the clear cases for the Moto X, which would not take away the beauty of the device, and would provide the extra care of the edges of the phone when you carelessly let it go off your hands onto the floor. </p>
<p> Gone are the days when you have those standard white, black or the plain colored smartphones, as the bamboo one looks too cool, and you should be able to flaunt it with that being no external case but a part of the device itself. Motorola suggests that it would take around 11 days to deliver the Moto X, and it is the 16GB version which you would be getting for $199, while the 32GB version costs you $249.99. </p>
<p> The Moto Maker goes to the best level of personalization even before you start using it, where you can specify a text which you want to see when the device boots up, and you can even sync with your Google account directly from the Moto Maker so that once you boot up the device for the first time, you won’t need a headache of adding the accounts and syncing it on the smartphone. </p>
<p> Go get the Bamboo version from Moto Maker – Link. (It’s the Natural option in the back plate which we are talking about) </p>

<p> Get the Moto X Camera Wrist Flick Feature on Any Android Phone – Download App </p>
<p> The Moto X smartphone is one of the best devices in the market, and it is the interface and features which contribute a lot to it. One of such features is the gesture where you need to just shake your Moto X to start the camera app. A simple flick of the wrist, and the Quick Capture feature is activated. </p>
<p> A developer Suyash Srijan has released a free app named QuickCamera which is doing the same function, i.e. replicating the Quick Capture feature of Moto X to bring that to any Android smartphone, although you might need to be a part of the beta group to get this feature working. </p>
<p> This is a gesture feature app, which would need you to rotate the camera twice to launch the default camera app, and it takes anywhere between 1-3 seconds based on your phone rotation and the response from the phone. And just like you see in the Moto X, there is a little vibrate which would tell you that the gesture is recognized and the camera app is going to be opened. The reason for this is to let you know that the gesture is recognized and there is no need to rotate more, or it could give some errors. </p>
<p> The QuickCamera app is still in the Alpha stage, so the users who are getting any errors can report them and expect to see quite a few updates in the near future with the fix for each. The app is going to run both when the screen is turned off, and when it is on. For now, it’s the accelerometer which is going to detect these movements and turning the camera on, but in the future versions, it should be the gyroscope which would do the job. </p>
<p> One of the areas of improvements which we would be seeing in the near future is the proximity sensors which are the ones to let the phone know whether the phone is in the pocket or in the hands, but for now what we are seeing in the settings is the ability to set the threshold of the shake which triggers the launch of the camera app. </p>
<p> You can download the app in the Play Store but before that, you will need to join the beta community – Link. </p>

<p> In the Mobile World Congress 2014 that is going on in Barcelona, Motorola has conducted an event in which the company has announced that the Moto X is expected to make its way to India and Australia within the next few weeks. This device would follow up Moto G that was launched earlier in India and got out of stock in India and many of the users had to wait for the device for bit longer even after its official release. </p>
<p> We have seen this device earlier making a buzz in other markets and will be coming to the Indian market and expected hit the market the same way as the Motorola Moto G has done. This Moto X is a 4.7 inch device with 720p display and is powered by a 1.7 GHz dual core Snapdragon S4 Pro accompanied by a 2 GB RAM and will be running on the latest Android 4.4 KitKat and will be featuring a 10 MP clear pixel rear camera and will be having a 2 MP front facing camera for video calling and for selfies. </p>

<p> Moto X priced at $399 Off-contract Permanently by Motorola – Details </p>
<p> The Motorola Moto X that was launched in August at $579 is getting a permanent price drop to $399 on any carrier without a new contract! Isn’t that an exciting offer? This offer also includes customized devices also. It is also mentioned in the official Motorola blog that the Moto X will be available for the customers to buy on monthly payment basis without a contract. </p>
<p> This permanent $399 price will now compete against the Google’s flagship models, like the Nexus 5 that is ranging around $349 to $399 unlocked. Moto X is considered as one of the best Android Smart Phones currently available universally. Even though the Nexus 5 is more powerful device to be ignored by power users, Moto X with its customization options will be a stand out, mainly considering the price drop. </p>
<p> The pricing is quite aggressive now, especially when you are having the Nexus 5 in mind along with the Moto X in the choice. And when you have such customization options like the Bamboo back for Moto X, why would you look for alternatives? </p>
<p> Earlier: Motorola is going to join the party along with the other retailers, brands and stores to provide the shopping deals on the Cyber Monday, and it is their recent best Moto X smartphone which is going to be sold with a noteworthy discount. Most of the other deals from the different brands are going to be available from Friday itself, when the actual big Black Friday sale is going to happen but Cyber Monday is more of the online sale where you get some selected but excellent deals on smartphones, tablets and online products. </p>
<p> As the Google+ page of Motorola Mobility says: Thinking about Cyber Monday already? We’ll be offering a $150 discount on any off-contract Moto X, including Moto Maker and Dev Edition. Supplies will be limited, so stay tuned for more details. http://goo.gl/UFd8N9 </p>
<p> The prices of the Moto X with the Cyber Monday promotion would be: </p>
<p> $349 for the 16GB version </p>
<p> $399 for the 32GB version </p>
<p> That’s a $150 discount for both the versions and this is seriously a very good deal against the Nexus 5 pricing, especially because the Nexus 5 comes in just the black and weird-white options, but Moto X comes with the color personalization and one of the other advantages with this – the developer edition too is available for the same price. What else would you want? </p>
<p> While this Cyber monday deal would impress many and motivate them to get the Moto X right away, especially when the downgraded version of this, the Moto G is out too and there is no promotion with it, but that would at the same time, be a disappointment for those who have recently got their Moto X after the customization was possible through all the networks and not just AT&T. </p>
<p> Check out for the various deals for this week, and a couple of them would include the Black Friday deals for the HP Slate 2800 and the Lenovo Ideapad A1000 and we would be sharing more of such deals very soon. </p>

<p> Moto X vs Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 Phone Comparison of Specs, Pricing </p>
<p> The Moto X from Motorola impressed everyone with its amazing performance and is also the first device released by Motorola after it got acquired by Google. On the other hand, the Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 is the successor of the Samsung Grand Duos that made a buzz in the marked when it got released. The Grand 2 is also a dual SIM device and also come in an mid-range sector. The Moto X is just launched in India, at a price of Rs. 23999, while the Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 is there quite some time, and it’s available for the price of Rs. 21,500. Let us compare both these devices and see where they stand. </p>
<p> Display and Dimensions </p>
<p> The Motorola Moto X has a 4.7 inch display with 1280 x 720 pixel resolutions and where as the Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 flaunts a 5.25 inch display with the same resolution, so here we can easily say that the Moto G has a better viewing experience with better ppi than the Galaxy Grand 2. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Grand 2 has the dimensions of 146.8 x 75.3 x 8.9 mm and the Moto x has 129.3 x 65.3 x 10.4 mm dimensions making it easier to hold in hand, but many people like the Smart phones that are big in hand. The Moto X weights just 130 grams that is 33 grams lighter than its competitor which is at 163 grams. </p>
<p> Internal Specifications </p>
<p> The Moto X has a Qualcomm MSM8960Pro Snapdragon dual core processor that clocks at 1.7 GHz where as there is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad core processor in the Galaxy Grand 2 that clocks at 1.2 GHz. The Moto X is accompanied with Adreno 320 GPU along with 2 GB of RAM and the Galaxy Grand 2 processor is coupled with Adreno 305 GPU and 1.5 GB of RAM. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 runs on Android 4.3 Jelly Bean Operating System where as the Motorola Moto X will be running on the latest Android 4.4 KitKat OS since it is acquired by Google. Here we can easily say that Moto X is a clear winner in terms of the internal specifications and the OS is advanced supporting almost all the apps on Google Play. </p>
<p> Camera / Storage </p>
<p> The rear camera on the Moto X is at 10 MP where as the Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 has an 8 MP rear camera. Both the device has autofocus and LED flash so there is no point in finding much of difference in these cameras. The front camera on the Moto X is at 2 Mp and the Galaxy Grand 2 has a 1.9 MP camera on the front. </p>
<p> The internal storage on the Moto X is at 16 GB but it cannot be extended as it lacks a micro SD card slot, where as the Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 has a 8 GB internal memory that can be extended up to 64 GB via Micro SD card slot. </p>
<p> 8-megapixel </p>
<p> 8 GB internal memory, Expandable storage up to 64 GB via micro SD card </p>
<p> Connectivity/ Battery </p>
<p> The Moto X has 4G LTE connectivity but Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 lacks it but most of the other connectivity’s are similar as we can see from the table given below. </p>
<p> 4G LTE, Cat3, 50 Mbps UL, 100 Mbps DL / EV-DO Rev. A, up to 3.1 Mbps </p>
<p> No 4G LTE connectivity </p>
<p> 2200 mAh Li-ion Battery </p>
<p> 2600 mAh Li-ion Battery </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> The Moto X is priced at Rs. 23,999 in India where as the Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 are priced around Rs. 21,500 in India. There is not much of a difference between both the devices in terms of the price but Moto X is a more power full device with better display and an upgraded OS that will be supporting more apps and Games since its Google acquisition. So I would rather be obliged in suggesting Moto X if you are in a tangle to choose between these two devices. </p>

<p> Moto X Tip: How to Solve Bluetooth Connections Not Working, Pairing Error </p>
<p> We have seen quite a lot of users complaining about the issues in pairing the Moto X with other smartphones, and they confirmed that after checking the status of the other device, and finally concluding that it is an issue with the Moto X. This issue isn’t only with the smartphones, but also with the audio devices and car systems which couldn’t pair with the Moto X even on multiple trials. For that to work, you don’t have any direct way but a few workarounds which are to be tried one after the other, to see which one would get the Bluetooth to work on the Moto X. </p>
<p> Bluetooth Not Connecting on Moto X – Best Fixes </p>
<p> 1. Make sure that the Bluetooth version is compatible. Sometimes, you are trying to pair the Moto X with some device which has an older version of Bluetooth connectivity in it and that could be the reason why your devices aren’t pairing. Check for the Bluetooth version, the protocols and then look below for the other fixes if you see that the Bluetooth versions are the same. </p>
<p> 2. Check whether the issue is limited to only these two devices – Try to pair these two devices with any other device having bluetooth, to check whether this is a pairing issue only for these two or it’s something only with the Moto X. </p>
<p> 3. Remove the pairing – Try to unpair the bluetooth device with your Moto X if you had paired them previously. For that, you will have to select the settings icon beside the particular bluetooth device, and then tap on “Unpair”. Now search for the available bluetooth devices in your Moto X, and try to pair the two again. </p>
<p> 4. Check whether the firmware version is latest – Many a times, the software version being an older one would cause a few problems, and the fix to such issues which many are facing, would be sent by the company as a software update. Check for any software update if available for your Moto X. </p>
<p> 5. Turn the phone and the bluetooth device off and restart them before trying to pair and connect. </p>
<p> 6. The last one would take some efforts but this for sure would make things work if none of the above workarounds helped you solve the issue. Take a backup of all the personal files, SMS, Contacts, Call log and then do a factory data reset of the Moto X. </p>
<p> We did notice that sometimes nothing works out, and that is only an issue with the compatibility between the devices. You won’t really be able to do much if these things didn’t help in solving the problem of bluetooth connectivity between Moto X and any other device. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> User Q&A: Moto X vs HTC Desire 816 – Which Android Phone to buy? </p>
<p> We usually suggest users on any social platform, then and there. But, this one was asked by at least a few people, who wanted me to tell my choice between these two smartphones – the Motorola Moto X and HTC Desire 816. These two are different in several ways, thus comparing them isn’t that easy and there are a few things you need to consider before choosing one. </p>
<p> Note: This is a comparison between the Moto X and HTC Desire 816, the Indian variants. These are both priced almost the same, with the Desire 816 being a little higher in price. </p>
<p> Check: </p>
<p> Moto X Price in India: </p>
<p> HTC Desire 816 Price in India: </p>
<p> Screen size: This is more of a personal choice over quality, because the screen size differs – a 4.7-inch HD display in the Moto X vs 5.5-inch HD display in the Desire 816. If you are taking the display into consideration, the AMOLED one in the Moto X is better than the LCD 2 in the HTC Desire 816. </p>
<p> Internal Specs: These both hold almost the same strength, for the reason that the Desire 816 comes with a Quad-core processor while it’s a 1.7GHz dual-core one in Moto X, but the RAM in Moto X is higher (2GB compared to 1.5GB), and it is always a known fact that it has to be a perfect combination of both if the phone has to run fast. The Moto X has a later version of GPU, i.e. Adreno 320 when compared to the Adreno 305 in HTC Desire 816. The HTC phone comes with the capability of using a MicroSD card for extra storage, while the Moto X comes with a fixed storage and no such option. </p>
<p> Camera: The Desire 816 beats Moto X with the 13MP shooter with some extra features when compared to the 10MP one in Moto X. Both the devices can record 1080p videos at 30 fps, but the actual captures of the Moto X are not great, and you can easily differentiate between the captures made by these two devices. The front-facing camera too is better in the HTC device, with a 5-megapixel camera compared to a 2-megapixel camera in Moto X. </p>
<p> How is Moto X better than HTC Desire 816 </p>
<p> Better RAM – 2GB compared to 1.5GB </p>
<p> Sharper screen, with more pixel density (312 ppi vs 267 ppi) </p>
<p> Higher internal storage (16GB vs 8GB) </p>
<p> Gorilla Glass protection on the screen </p>
<p> Although not certified, the Moto X can resist water spills or even a dip in water </p>
<p> 16GB internal storage, compared to 8GB in Desire </p>
<p> How is HTC Desire 816 better than Moto X </p>
<p> A larger screen, only if you preferred to have one </p>
<p> A better camera quality – both front and back cameras </p>
<p> A better battery – 2600 mAh compared to 2200 mAh </p>
<p> Supports two SIM cards (Dual-SIM device, while Moto X is a Single-SIM one) </p>
<p> Expandable storage (with MicroSD card, to 128GB) – no MicroSD card slot in Moto X although there is a new variant by Motorola which is not yet available in Indian market </p>
<p> Both the devices run the latest Android 4.4.2 KitKat but the HTC Desire 816 has the Sense UI which is quite interesting, but for those who prefer a simpler interface, the Moto X has the stock Android ROM with the most basic and easy-to-use interface, and it has the special features such as Moto Alert, Google Now, etc. </p>
<p> So, you can make your choice based on which features you wanted in your smartphone, and which device have got those. Of course in the end, you might have to compromise with a feature or two, but that shouldn’t force you to change your opinion. Do also note that HTC has got more service centers for now, in India when compared to Motorola, if you are someone who thinks a lot about the after-sales service. </p>
<p> If I were to suggest any alternatives to these, you can check for the Gionee Elife S5.5, Nexus 5 (which is a bit higher in price but an excellent device) and Gionee Elife E7 (which has an excellent display, great processor and camera but battery and OS aren’t the best). </p>

<p> Moto Z2 Force Measures 5.99mm in Thickness, But Features 3.5mm Audio Jack </p>
<p> The new smartphones under the Moto Z series will be launched in the next couple of months. Last week, the images of the Moto Z2 were leaked online. Now, the 360-degree CAD video of the Moto Z2 Force brings even more information about the new devices. The big camera module on the rear of the Moto Z2 and Moto Z2 Force will be featuring dual cameras along with dual LED flash. Since the Moto Mods needs to fit on the back of the Moto Z devices with the semi-modular feature, there won’t significant changes made to design of the devices. </p>
<p> Apart from the big camera bump on the rear, there is also 16-pin connector on the bottom for Moto Mods. The device will feature a 5.5-inch display, and we expect that to come with Quad HD (2560 x 1440 pixels) resolution. Last year, the company skipped the 3.5mm audio jack on the Moto Z and Moto Z Force devices as they came with just 6.99mm thickness. Now, the upcoming Moto Z2 and Moto Z2 Force will be even slimmer by measuring just 5.99mm in thickness. However, the devices sport the 3.5mm audio jack placed on the bottom edge. </p>
<p> With the slimmer body of the Moto Z2 devices, we might see a slightly smaller battery than the 3,500mAh of the Moto Z and Moto Z Force. On the front, we will see a big oval-shaped fingerprint sensor instead of the square-shaped sensor. From the front, the device looks similar to the recently launched Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus. The Moto logo placed on the top bezel of the Moto G5 devices is moved to the bottom bezel on the Moto Z2 devices. The volume rocker and the textured power button can be seen on the right edge. </p>
<p> While the resolution of the front camera is not unknown, alongside it is a dual tone LED flash which we are seeing for the first time on the front. It comes with a metal built unibody design along with shining chamfered edges. There is also a USB Type-C on the bottom edge for charging. The leaks suggest this is the same device that was used by Sprint for testing its Gigabit LTE network. If those leaks are to be believed, then the Moto Z2 and Moto Z2 Force will come powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 SoC built on the 10nm FinFET process. </p>

There is a waterdrop notch can be seen from the image that has been listed and it gives 19:9 aspect ratio. There is a 3600mAh battery on the back and has the support for 15W TurboPower fast charging technology. </p>
<p> We can find a Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 Mobile Platform built on 11nm FinFET SoC under the hood coupled with 4GB of RAM. The onboard storage of the handset is 128GB and might not get a microSD card support like the earlier devices. Talking about the camera, there is a 48MP single rear-facing camera while on the front we can see a 25MP selfie sensor. The main camera on the rear gives a 12MP output using Quad Pixel technology. </p>
<p> It will come out of the box with the latest Android 9 Pie operating system and the handset is splash proof. From the image we can see the there is a Type-C port and a 3.5mm audio jack.

<p> How to Move Android Apps APK from Internal Memory to SD Card </p>
<p> If you are using Android phone and if you are not able to download and use more applications is like a jet plane with only one passenger on it and is running out of fuel. Well our Android phones are very powerful and a proper use of the resources may prove you very useful. Android application base is vast and the variety will never stop us from using them and try them but what if we are not able to save the applications on our phone and use them as and when required? So for this reason we have the facility to save applications or install applications on the SD card itself. </p>
<p> The phone internal memory is normally not adequate to install all the required applications of our choice, thus it becomes very difficult to manage all the applications and use them accordingly. The Android version 2.2 allows us to move applications to SD card so that we can install applications on the SD card and thus use all the required applications as and when wanted. The application namely MoveToSD will help with the problem as easily as putting a dot. This application is very easy to use as it has a very simplistic UI which helps in easy application management. </p>
<p> MoveToSD is just the right application for those who want to manage applications, thus applications can be moved from internal phone memory to SD card and can also be moved from SD to internal phone memory as per requirement. The very simple UI makes the job easier as we can very easily reach the columns, here there are two columns, one for applications installed on SD card and another for applications installed on phone memory. Along with that the application also displays the amount of memory left free in phone memory and amount of memory left free on the SD card, thus we are very much aware of the memory that will be used up and the memory that will be left free on the SD card as well as phone memory. </p>
<p> MoveToSD can also perform normal operations like force stop, uninstall, clear data and clear cache. The only setback for this application is that only one application can be moved to SD at a given time, thus batch operations are not possible. If the application is used in order to save phone memory then batch operations are really not required. For example, if an application is frequently used then that particular application can be left in the phone memory and games which take up most of the space can be moved to SD card in order save phone memory. Application is only supported on Android devices with version 2.2 and above. </p>

<p> some apps can’t be moved to sd as developers have developed it that way, you need to root your device to move these apps to sd! </p>
<p> Not all applications can be moved to SD, it happens because an application needs support of move to SD. If that support is present then you can move that application using MoveToSD. </p>
<p> Make sure that your application is updated to latest version. Normally most of the latest application updates include move to SD support. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> How to Multitask with Dual Window Feature in LG G Pro 2 </p>
<p> Multitasking is usually possible in most of the Android smartphones these days, but there’s just one way to do it – pull out the list of recently opened apps and currently running ones, and select any one to run. But with the Dual Window feature that is available in the LG G Pro 2, the multitasking is taken to the next level. Although it is not the only device having this feature of using two windows at the same time on the same screen, the feature coming included is already good for the users of the LG G Pro 2. </p>
<p> Multi Window / Dual Window feature in the LG G Pro 2 needs to be first activated before you are able to use it. To activate it, you need to go to Settings > General > Multitasking and here, the second option “Dual Window” has to be checked. </p>
<p> To then open the Multi Window feature, you just need to tap and hold the “Back” button in the bottom, and it would open a center tray of app icons which can be opened in the Multi window. Not all the apps which are installed, are available for using in the Multi Window. You just need to tap or drag the app icon to top or bottom to open it and occupy the half of the screen initially. Then, select another app icon and it would take the second half of the screen. </p>
<p> You are free to increase or decrease the size of the application window and the size of the other window changes based on it. This is pretty handy when you are trying to use two apps such as Youtube and Memo at the same time, trying to write down things from a Youtube video. </p>
<p> The applications that work in the Multi Window option, are as follows: Videos, Internet, Messaging, Email, Gallery, Chrome, Memo, Youtube, Maps, Hangouts, Gmail and File Manager. The Multi Window feature would remember what were the apps you used recently while using this feature, and you can use the same combination by tapping on “Recent” which is first on the list. </p>

<p> MWC 2014 Event Live Updates & News – List of Events and Products Expected </p>
<p> The CES 2014 was pretty good but not the best for the mobile enthusiasts. Why? it’s more about the general tech and electronics, with no huge focus in the mobile industry, although there was a flurry of smartphones and tablet devices announced at Las Vegas in the first week of January, now the Mobile World Congress 2014 event in Barcelona is what you should look for, if you wanted to keep a track of what is being announced and where the mobile industry is headed to. </p>
<p> We were there at the MWC 2013 event and did a full coverage of the event, and we would be doing the same this year, as you would see the AndroidAdvices team at Barcelona. If you are an attendee, make sure you are downloading the MWC Android app. </p>
<p> What is expected at MWC 2014 </p>
<p> Samsung at MWC 2014 </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S5 </p>
<p> There are several devices expected to be introduced during the MWC event in Barcelona, and although its not almost certain, there are many expecting even the next flagship from Samsung, i.e. the Samsung Galaxy S5 to be announced at the MWC 2014. </p>
<p> The basic version of the Galaxy Grand is said to be coming during the event, and it should be powered by a 1.2 GHz quad-core processor under the 5-inch WVGA display. </p>
<p> If the rumors about the Galaxy S5 anywhere near true, then the same would be about the next generation Galaxy gear smartwatch. Because, a VP at Samsung had said that they are planning to unveil the next flagship Galaxy smartphone along with the refreshed smartwatch, with a better design. </p>
<p> This was just announced at the Samsung Forum 2014 at Indonesia, and it comes with the specs which hold themselves between the Note 2 and Note 3. Samsung would showcase this at the MWC booth. </p>
<p> Another Neo device in the list, Samsung announced this tablet at the Samsung Forum and this one too is going to be seen at the Samsung booth in the event. </p>
<p> A huge device, with the 12.2-inch display and power packed with the heavy internal specs, the Galaxy NotePro from Samsung is going to be one of the best in the list shown by the company at the MWC event, although the Galaxy S5, if announced, might take away all the attention. </p>
<p> This device comes in the mid-range pricing and specs, and it is already launched in a few markets after being introduced at the Samsung Forum, but we might get a hands-on at the MWC event. </p>
<p> Sony at MWC 2014 </p>
<p> This could be the successor to the Xperia Z1, but there is no name known for now. The D6503 was recently leaked with a few photos and there are quite a few differences seen from the current flagship. </p>
<p> On the lines of Xperia Z1, here comes the successor as Xperia Z2. With 3GB of RAM, bigger screen size of 5.2″ screen along 20.7MP of rear facing camera, these are just the snippets of features which this smartphone comes with. Do check out the complete review, specs and features of this Android smartphone. </p>
<p> LG at MWC 2014 </p>
<p> The successor to the LG Optimus G Pro is finally official, with no actual details but the confirmation from the company that this will be launched at the MWC event.

<p> LG didn’t want to keep silent with the mini version though, as the 2013 flagship LG G2 got a mini version which is not the best with the specs, but the screen size of 4.7-inch makes it smaller than the original one, and a reason for LG to come up with a new device.

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Nanu, Android app with Free Worldwide Calling facility to Mobiles & Landlines – Details </p>
<p> Nanu, an all new android app which was launched quite a while back offers free voice calls to non-nanu users as well. With the likes of Skype, Viber already in the business, this android app is fast going viral and lets check out on what all it offers and how it offers the calling facility to which all countries. The best part of this app is that with this you can also make calls to the landline as well as mobile phone numbers. This app comes with the simple and beautiful interface with easy to use controls. </p>
<p> So just in case if you thought that it’s a PAID app, then it’s not the case as it’s the FREE app, the only catch being it’s the Advertisement based app. </p>
<p> How NANU makes money? While the opposite user picks up the call, you will be hearing a short advertisement and once the opposite party picks up the call, the ad will stop playing. The revenue of the call is being compensated/ subsidized with the advertisement revenue and Nanu is working with companies like Nestle, PayPal, HTC, KFC etc. to make this app much more popular. </p>
<p> Competition? This NANU app also works on the 2G networks and is best suited for the markets where 2G is still prominent and 3G hasn’t picked up yet. This aspect of the app makes this app different from other apps like Skype, Viber etc. </p>
<p> Free calling Details to Landlines & Mobiles Not unlimited calls, but this app gives free 15 minutes of credit to call to non-nanu users and only for the first million users. Initially, free calls to landlines will only be limited to 41 countries which includes US, UK etc. while free calls to mobile phones includes the list of countries like India, Hungary, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, US & Israel. </p>
<p> The bad part of this is that as of now you can’t buy the credit even if you want to as you will have to wait for some more time since company is yet to launch this refilling thing of balance. </p>
<p> Do let us know in the comments section just in case if you need any more details about this new app. </p>

<p> Moto X Gen 2 Officially Announced – Price Specs & Features </p>
<p> Motorola has officially announced the next generation flagship device, which is not named, Moto X+1,or Moto X2, instead company is called it new Moto X. The much rumoured device sports a new design with a touch of previous aesthetic as the design head at Motorola, Jim Wicks, would have wanted it. </p>
<p> The second generation Moto X comes with a 5.2-inch AMOLED Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels resolution), and is powered by the current generation Snapdragon 801 processor, clocking at 2.5 GHz. It will be currently running Android 4.4 Kitkat operating system sporting an stock Android experience, but it will probably be the first device to upgrade with Android L version later this fall. The new device is packed with a 2GB of RAM, and has option to choose 16GB or 32GB internal storage, as it does not feature a microSD card slot for expansion. </p>
<p> In the camera department, the device sports an 13MP rear camera with Dual LED flash and 4K video shooting capability, which is an upgrade from previous 10MP rear shooter. For connectivity, the device offers various set of features like 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and GLONASS. It also boasts four microphones, which will help in various purposes like calling, voice recording, etc. All this is powered by a 2300mAh,which is 100mAh higher than the previous Moto X model. </p>
<p> Motorola also adds a new set of Moto Maker customization, which includes 17 colored backs, 4 leathers and 4 woods options to choose from. The Texas manufacturer is known for its app suite (Active Display, touchless Control and Moto Assist), which was originally introduced on Moto X last year, is now rebranded as Active Display and Touchless Control to Moto Display and Moto Voice, respectively. </p>
<p> The Moto Voice now allows you to customize the voice controls by changing app phrases, to be something other than “Ok, Google Now”. Now you can post your facebook status, Open Youtube, as well as send messages on WhatsApp by rephrasing the hotwords to suite your style. Company has also built commands for you, like “goodnight” or “good morning”, which would turn sleep mode on or off. While Moto Display app is just the same as Active Display. </p>
<p> Company has also introduced a special charger, which will be available to purchase separately, the device is named as Turbo or Super Charger. By using this charger, you can juice up your Moto X with approximately 8 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes, which is pretty incredible per say. </p>
<p> One of the most interesting thing to note about new Moto X is that company has introduced the metal body frame in their new flagship. The Moto X first generation was targeted among the mid-higher range of smartphones, but with second generation Moto X, company is aiming at the high-end device market as the screen size is much bigger and has competitive specs to compete with recently announced flagship, Sony Xperia Z3, which was not a big upgrade from the previous Xperia Z2. </p>
<p> The new Moto x will be available at a contract pricing of $99 for two years and is priced at $499 for its off the contract retailing. It will be available for purchase in the United States, sometime this month only. </p>

<p> Nexus 4 vs Moto G Android Phone Comparison of Specs, Pricing </p>
<p> The Moto G is now the budget sensation in the Android range right now, but let’s not ignore the Nexus 4 from LG, which was the predecessor to the recently launched Nexus 5, and although the pricing is a little different, one shouldn’t ignore the Nexus 4 when they are considering to buy the Moto G. Let us compare two high end Android devices Nexus 4 and Moto G, today and find out which one is better on the performance, looking in to both the devices in detail. </p>
<p> Appearance and External Hardware </p>
<p> Nexus 4 is made of all glass and rubber, whereas the Moto G is made of the traditional old matte plastics used for phones but the back covers of the Moto G can be customized unlike the Nexus 4. But even after the customizations on the Moto G, I feel Nexus 4 is much better in the looks and feel because of its glass back and the rubber giving better grip. It doesn’t mean Moto G is bad, but if compared to Nexus 4, this LG device is a clear winner. </p>
<p> Display </p>
<p> The Nexus 4 has 4.7 inches display, 2 inch bigger than its opponent Moto G (4.5 inch) but we can notice that the Moto G gives more sharp and bright display and uses the Gorilla glass 3 protection which is stronger and more scratch resistant compared to the Nexus 4 that uses the older edition of the Gorilla Glass 2, since Moto G is a newer device and got benefited for getting up to date screen layer. So interms of the display Moto G is a clear winner here. </p>
<p> Internal Hardware </p>
<p> The Nexus 4’s have quad core Snapdragon S4 chipset powering the device, coupled with 2 GB of RAM and a Adreno 320 GPU, providing a powerful hardware to run applications and games smoothly on the Android platform. It is also helped with its multitasking capability for multiple tasks. </p>
<p> In terms of the Moto G, it has a Snapdragon 400 chipset, clocking at 1.2 GHz with four ARM Cortex A7 cores coupled with just 1 GB of RAM and Adreno 305 GPU which are built in for more power efficiency, unlike the Nexus 4 that is consider to be a powerful device. </p>
<p> In terms of the connectivity Nexus 4 supports pentaband 42 Mbps DC-HSDPA, giving you the fastest 3G browsing around the world, whereas the Moto G supports 21 Mbps speeds with different bands, depending on the models. The Moto G also lacks the NFC which can be seen on the Nexus 4. Both the devices come with 8 GB and 16 GB variants and run on the latest Android 4.4 KitKat. So even here the LG device gets an upper hand over its opposition. </p>
<p> Camera </p>
<p> In the camera region there are many other devices having better cameras in the market today, but the Nexus 4 has an 8 MP shooter on its rear and the Moto G has just a 5 MP camera and both have a 1.3 MP front camera. The Nexus 5 will be the winner here because of its higher megapixel count and the ability to capture pictures faster and giving better daylight shorts and supporting 1080p video. </p>
<p> Battery </p>
<p> Both the Nexus 4 and Moto G have similar battery of 2070 mAh and 2100 mAh respectively. Despite the similar battery’s the Moto G is a clear winner here giving better life compared to the Nexus 4, because of its lack of hardware when compared to the Nexus 4 which has a powerful internal hardware using more power. So the Moto G is the winner here because of its longer battery life, thanks to its CPU that is built in for power efficiency. </p>
<p> Price </p>
<p> The Nexus 4 device has been officially discontinued by Google because the Nexus 5 has taken its place, we don’t find a new device anywhere but u can get a used one for 200 Euros ($270.92) which is pretty high, where as the Moto G is quit cheaper coming at 100 Euros ($135.46) for the 8 GB variant and can be easily got in from the market. </p>
<p> Other than these feature, the Nexus 4 will be getting the updates quicker than the Moto G as it is a pure Android device but any how Nexus 4 is no more in the market but still consider powerful as any device in the market. However the LG has come up with the Nexus 5 which has better spec’s compared to its predecessor. Nexus 4 would be available via local deals who had stocked these up knowing the fact that Google won’t be listing it on the Play Store for a long time. </p>

<p> LG Nexus 5 Detailed Battery Review and Scores </p>
<p> Battery is one of the most important aspects which most people ignore while buying a new SmartPhone. Battery life is very much a important factor as the display and chipset of the smart phone do. More the clock speed and cores, more the battery is used. Although Smartphones are smart enough to adjust the speed according to the task we also need to know how much battery it uses for our regular usage. Well today we would like to put forward the results that we have got from the Nexus 5 battery test that we have been performing from few days. </p>
<p> This battery test is done considering all the aspects of the users as some like to browse most of the time on the device, few like to listen to songs / watch videos and others like playing games. Each test is done on the LG Nexus 5 that has a 2300 mAh battery and all these results are given below in detail according to the usage. </p>
<p> 3rd Test – Browsing </p>
<p> 4th Test – Gaming </p>
<p> Note – These tests are done with the maximum volume, Wi-Fi Switched on, brightness levels-medium and few application’s running on the back ground (Dalvik run-time is used). More over there might be a few minute changes in the results that you get with your device and we are not responsible for the difference in results. </p>
<p> 1. Music Playback </p>
<p> Music is almost a part of living and every one listens to it, be it while Working, Eating, Running, Walking, Playing or while in Gym. Everyone has a different choice of music so they dump their favorite play list and start listening to it. From our test we can easily find out how much of battery is consumed while you are enjoying the music. </p>
<p> We have played the music for half an hour and the battery utilized was 3%, out of which 31% was utilized by screen and and 30% was utilized by Google music play. With this rate the battery of the device is will die after 16.6 hours. </p>
<p> RATING – 5/5 </p>
<p> 2. Video Playback </p>
<p> The video playback test on the Nexus 5 is done with two different video qualities, one being a 720p (HD) and another was 1080p (FHD). Below table gives the results of the same. </p>
<p> Results with HD video playback </p>
<p> The results after 1 hour of continuous playback shows that the battery was down by 20% and the consume rate was 3.0033 units/ minute. With this rate your battery will become dead after 5 hours of continuous HD video play. Clearly illustrating that you could watch two to three movies on your smart phone before it goes out of its charge. </p>
<p> Results with FHD video playback </p>
<p> Full HD Video playback drained the battery by 20% after one hour and the consume rate was the same as it was in the case with HD playback. The battery will become zero after 5 hours of FHD video play clearly depicting that there was not much difference in the discharge and you can get a total of 5 hours usage while enjoying the medial files. </p>
<p> RATING – 4.5/5 </p>
<p> 3. Web Browsing </p>
<p> In this busy schedule, you always cannot turn to your laptop or system to browse the internet, now a day’s almost everything is done through internet from ordering a pizza to booking a flight ticket. You will also browse on the phone while you are walking or sitting alone down the street, chat with friends, read news and all the happenings round the world. The thing here is to know how much battery is consumed from it and plan accordingly when you are low on battery. </p>
<p> Our experience with browsing on Nexus 5 was pretty good, we went ahead and browsed for 30 minutes and the battery consumed was 11%, draining the battery in 9.09 hours and the consume rate was 2.50 units/minute. </p>
<p> RATING – 4/5 </p>
<p> 4. Gaming </p>
<p> Gaming was one of the interesting parts of the review, as it was more fun compared to other tests that we have done on the device. We know that the Nexus 5 is Google’s one of the very few devices that run Stock Android version. The handset supports almost all the Games and Apps on the play store and it was time for playing some high quality game that can take some real power from the battery. </p>
<p> After 30 minutes of gaming, we found that the battery was down by 14% which is around 28% in an hour. Considering this rate the phone is expected to last for not more than 3 hours along with which the screen usage was attributed to around 35% of battery consumed. </p>
<p> RATING – 2/5 </p>
<p> 5. Normal Usage </p>
<p> Major part of the phone that you are using will be idle condition and even while you are doing nothing with the device these is some part of the battery drain. This Normal usage is considered when you use the smart phone for some random calls, reading the notification and messages. It is important to know how long your device can last while you are using it normally. </p>
<p> After 30 minutes of normal usage, the battery of the device was down by 3%, i.e. if you use this device normally, the battery will last for 16.66 hours. This is pretty low battery back up considering the normal use with the Wi-Fi switched ON and normal brightness. This is very much poor but we can expect this from Nexus 5, because of its powerful hardware and the sensors running on it. </p>
<p> RATING – 4.5/5 </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> After all the results from the graphs and stats that we have we can say that the battery life of the Nexus 5 is quite good for media consumption, average for gaming and better for normal usage. If you are a person who browses a lot of web and uses the device more for media related activities then its recommended for you. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Nexus 5 Colors – Which Color to Choose between White & Black </p>
<p> This would seem to be a weird question to ask because the colors usually are a choice for the end user, but that is not the case with the Nexus 5 from Google, because this time Google has made it different from the usual trend, and here our answer straightaway for a choice would be the Black color and there are quite a few reasons for it. </p>
<p> Most of the smartphones from different brands have the White and Black color options, and in that we usually opt for the white one (check out the LG G2 review where the white looks excellent) because of the excellent look and the black would make it look like a cheap one. But this time, Nexus 5 has got a body which doesn’t really attract with the white color, and the Black color would be a wise option if you are looking it from different ways. </p>
<p> Firstly, the fingerprint resistance – frankly, both of them would take the fingerprints but the black one has a little rubberish and matte-type of back body and thus the fingerprint isn’t visible, unlike on the glossy white back. </p>
<p> Next, the other reason why we find the white color not that good is because although Google/LG tried to be different and have just the back panel in white color, it looks odd when seen from the side, as half of the side panel has white and the other half black. Without noticing that it’s the Nexus 5, one would feel that you placed a replacement back cover to a phone with a different color. </p>
<p> Third and very strong reason why we would totally opt for the Black color Nexus 5 over the white one is the earpiece area. It’s a small circle above the screen and that looks the most weird in the white model, because that area is specially given the white color and it is the only part that shows from the front in White. I was confused with it many a times already thinking that I got some notifications, as it looks just like the LED notification lights that usually blink above the screen. </p>
<p> Of course many might still want to have the white color only because it’s White and usually looks better than the white one, but seriously, check out our video to understand what why we are preferring the black color. Did you already purchase one? do let us know whether you liked your Nexus 5’s color (black or white). </p>

<p> Nexus 5 tops the List of Android Phones for Gaming via Basemark X Benchmark </p>
<p> The Nexus 5 is just launched but things about it were already flowing around, and that included the benchmark tests and the results which showed that this smartphone has got all that is needed to be one of the top devices. Not the actual benchmarks, but there was a test done with the gaming performance and this was by the Basemark X 1.0 app which is a cross platform tester for the gaming performance of the smartphones. Interestingly, the Nexus 5 is second on the list and the first one is the iPhone 5s, running the A7 chipset and the iOS 7. </p>
<p> Rightware aggregates all the data and scores from all the devices and lists them out in a single chart, and the gaming chart of its has no Windows Phone powered smartphone in the top five, with the first one being the iPhone 5s, and the next four are the Android smartphones. Surprisingly, the Sharp AQUOS SHL23 is third on the list. The Basemark X benchmark is designed primarily for ARM-based smartphones and tablets on Android 4.0 or upper OS. </p>
<p> The testing and the results were shared even before the announcement of the Nexus 5, but all the specs of the device matched the ones shown on the official page so the results are quite believable, and why not, it’s the Snapdragon 800 processor with the Adreno 330 GPU. </p>
<p> There’s another benchmark, the Sunspider benchmark which was conducted a day after the launch of the Nexus 5 and even there the iPhone 5s topped the rankings while the Nexus 5 was the second best, followed by Xperia Z1 from Sony, LG G2, HTC One and then the Samsung Galaxy S4. The GFXBench T-Rex HD off-screen test had shown the Galaxy Note 3 on the top, with the iPhone 5s and Nexus 5 to follow it. </p>
<p> Obviously when you check the specs, there’s quite a few similar smartphones out in the market with such specs but Nexus 5 seems stable and pretty good in the various tests at least. </p>

The ones with the T-Mobile network have a good news, the T-mobile network has partnered with Google to provide 2GB of 4G LTE data for free with the purchase of Nexus 7. This 2GB of data is for the first month only, and this would at least give the users an idea of how good the LTE service of T-mobile is. </p>

<p> Nokia to be renamed “Microsoft Mobiles” – Are we seeing The End of Nokia? </p>
<p> A letter sent to the ones in relation with the Nokia Services, read the words “Please note that upon the close of the transaction between Microsoft and Nokia, the name of Nokia Corporation/Nokia Oyj will change to Microsoft Mobile Oy,”. There you read it, Nokia won’t hold the name which was there since years, and it is going to be called Microsoft Mobiles. A bolt move, or a big blunder? </p>
<p> For me as an avid user of Android devices, I was totally excited about the Nokia X when the first rumors about it came up. Then came in the actual launch at the MWC 2014 where we saw utter disappointment from everyone and I had the same feeling. Nokia X with the Nokia X platform based on AOSP? that too a WVGA 4-inch display, dual-core processor and the SDK being the Jelly Bean one! Crazy past stuff in the world full of high-end devices. </p>
<p> Note: It’s the entity which is being renamed, but after the deal, it shouldn’t be a surprise if we see devices named Microsoft Mobile 920 for Nokia Lumia 920. </p>
<p> Nokia didn’t do really well in the Windows Phone section, but Microsoft is keen on making it worse I suppose. They are renaming it as Microsoft Mobiles where you won’t see a hint of Android at all, as no one would directly use the competition to promote themselves. </p>
<p> “* With the completion of this sale, the Nokia Devices & Services business will be part of this Finnish entity, Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft Corp.” </p>
<p> Although the deal and the decision of name change, Nokia’s handset and services business won’t be really affected and it should stay the same and run as usual under Microsoft, and Stephen Elop, the CEO and President of Nokia before the acquisition, would be the head of this division under Microsoft. </p>
<p> It’s just the mobile services section which is going to change, but the functioning of the telecom networks and infrastructure business NSN, its mapping and location based services HERE and its Advanced Technologies business are all going to be the same. Let us see where all this is headed to, and whether Microsoft is doing a mistake removing the iconic name of Nokia. </p>

<p> Nokia X Benchmark Test Scores – AnTuTu, Quadrant Standard & Nenamark II </p>
<p> The Nokia X is not a powerful device, and this is a known fact, thanks to the dual-core Snapdragon S4 processor along with 512MB of RAM and Adreno 203 GPU, but has Nokia tried to optimize it and make it faster in any way? We did a few standard benchmark tests on the device to see how it fares against the other mid-range to high-end smartphones. As the Nokia X runs the Android-based Nokia X platform, it wasn’t hard to find and install these benchmark apps (check Nokia X Android App sideloading guide to learn how you can do it), and then the tests gave pretty decent results, not lesser than or exceeding the expectations one would have for this internal configuration. </p>
<p> Before getting into the scoring, let me give you some brief info about the internal hardware of Nokia X. </p>
<p> AnTuTu Benchmark This test got the scoring of 7669 points, and that is quite low, even below the Samsung Galaxy S2, which was launched three years back. The scoring got less especially because of the low graphics performance and the limited RAM. </p>
<p> Quadrant Standard We were happy to see that at least the scoring here was not shameful. When compared to the standard scores given by Galaxy Nexus and Motorola Atrix 4G, the Nokia X fared better with a score of 3020 which was decent enough, considering the parameters which this app takes into consideration. </p>
<p> Nenamark II This was the final test we did, and this was to check out the graphics performance based on the frames per second output for the high quality graphics content. The score here was 32 fps, an average after trying out the test for three times. It’s again not really bad, considering the various factors. </p>
<p> The AnTuTu benchmark is where the device doesn’t impress at all, but with the Quadrant Standard and Nenamark II, the scoring was quite enough to justify the pricing and the internal configuration of the Nokia X. Check out the Nokia X camera review, and the Nokia X FAQ to learn more about the device. </p>

<p> Nokia X seems to be an entry level phone, we shouldn’t compare it with HTC One, Xperia Z and the likes. I would look at it as an upgrade to users who use basic Android phones like Galaxy Y, HTC Explorer, Galaxy Star. </p>
<p> We surely didn’t compare with the high-end devices, but the pricing doesn’t really match the Galaxy Y (which ofcourse now is out of availability in market) and the Galaxy Star. Nokia has brought this into a mid-range pricing and thus should have justified it with the good performance. </p>

On the other hand we have the Motorola Moto G, which is a pretty good one in competition and is also considered as one of the powerful smartphones in the mid-range Android smartphone market. Let us compare both these Smart phone and see how they stand out. </p>
<p> Display and Dimensions </p>
<p> The Nokia XL flaunts a 5 inch IPS LCD display with 480 x 800 pixels resolutions and has dimensions measuring up to 141.4 x 77.7 x 10.9 mm. It also weighs quite a bit with a weight of 190 grams. The Motorola Moto G sports a 4.5 inch IPS LCD capacitive touch screen, while rendering 720 x 1280 pixels resolution and the device’s overall dimensions measure up to 129.9 x 65.9 x 11.6 mm and weighs 143 grams. So the Nokia XL is bigger in size and also on the heavier side but Moto G has much better resolutions given better viewing angles. </p>
<p> Internal Specifications </p>
<p> The Moto G has a faster processor with a 1.2 GHz quad core cortex-A7 processor and Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, and the Nokia device powers up the XL via a 1 GHz dual core A5 processor coupled with an Adreno 203 GPU. The RAM on the Moto G is at 1 GB where as the Nokia XL has a lesser RAM of 768 MB. Moreover the Moto G runs on the latest version of Android 4.4.2 KitKat Operating system. </p>

<p> Quad core cortex-A7 processor and Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 </p>

<p> Camera / Storage </p>
<p> The Nokia XL comes with a 5 MP rear camera autofocus and LED flash, and a 2 MP front camera whereas the Motorola Moto G comes with a 5 MP rear camera and 1.2 MP front camera. The Nokia device has a 4 GB of Internal memory that can be extended further to 32 GB via micro SD card, but the Moto G comes is 8 and 16 GB variants and do not provide any memory extension. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Moto G is a powerful device that has made a buzz that was offered for relatively less price but Nokia XL pricing is still under cover and we haven’t seen it performing yet so we cannot give any verdict yet. The XL is going to be launched soon, and will be Nokia’s perfect hit against Motorola’s re-entry into the Indian smartphone market, but still, the Moto G could hold the edge in it’s own ways. Here are a few Moto G alternatives if you were thinking to consider some other options too. Nokia is rumored to be setting the price of the XL to somewhere around Rs. 13000 which is the price at which Moto G is selling hot. </p>

<p> Nokia X Tear Down – Looks What’s Within this Budget Android Smart Phone – Parts List </p>
<p> The month of March 2014 would be exciting because we would be seeing the launch and availability of the First Android Smart Phone from Nokia and its dubbed as the Nokia X along with X+ & XL. Confused? Well these are not T-Shirt sizes but actual models and we have covered a few articles on them along with videos. Nokia X X+ Hands-On, Nokia XL Hands-On </p>
<p> Today there was a tear down of the Nokia X showing all the parts which were inside the body and surprisingly they look similar to the Nokia Asha or 3310. Check the following image for more. </p>
<p> The parts clearly show the front panel, a camera module, motherboard, earphone module, display, removable back cover and around 11 screws. Surprisingly the battery is missing in this tear down, apart from which everything else is quite similar to what was shown in the Asha 501 phone. </p>
<p> It would be a surprise if the price of this phone crossed USD 150 or Rs 8000 because that would make it a hard sell. Nokia Fans who have been loving the Android OS would be ready to shell out money but for Nokia to make a bigger impact in terms of market share they should focus on a better pricing especially at launch. </p>

<p> Notable Smart Phones – Best Mobiles in Market </p>
<p> Almost everyone seems to have a smart phone these days. The iPhone really bought the market to the consumer and smart phones are not just the domain of the elite businessman. With advanced social networking functionality and internet browsing speeds that are on par with high speed cabled connections – they have quickly cornered the cell phone market. Following is a list of some of the smart phones that have impressed us recently. </p>
<p> Apple iPhone 4 </p>
<p> Ok, ok, I just want to get this one out of the way. If it wasn’t for the antenna problems that plagued the phone at launch it would’ve been a contender for one of the best phones of the year. However, the phone itself is great. The iPhone OS is incredibly intuitive and the range of apps available are second to none. Also, despite the antenna problems it is probably the most advanced iPhone released to date. </p>
<p> Samsung Captivate </p>
<p> Incredible phone by an incredible company – people are quick to assume Samsung as less of an innovator and more of a copier. This is just not the case. Samsung have a massive research and development budget and this phone delivers. It has a 1 GHz processor and is incredibly powerful. It also boasts the ability to capture HD video. It has a huge 4 inch screen and an excellent display resolution. </p>
<p> Blackberry Bold 9700 </p>
<p> Probably the best Blackberry released so far. The interface seems to have improved dramatically from older Blackberry models. It is also an incredibly smart phone (pun intended). The keyboard is nice to use as well. I am one of those people who aren’t a big fan of onscreen keyboards and this phone is great in this regard. If you have large fingers you might not like it so much – that said however, I found the keyboard surprisingly ergonomic and easy to use. </p>
<p> Samsung Vibrant </p>
<p> Another Samsung phone – maybe I am a Samsung fan boy after all. This phone is all touch screen activated and has the same size screen as the captivate but has a few extra little features built straight into the phone such as a Kindle app (for e-books), Sims 3 (game), Avatar (yes, the full movie) and mobile TV. It builds upon the Android OS with the Samsung TouchWiz interface. All in all; the phone is a nice package. </p>
<p> Palm Pre Plus </p>
<p> The Palm Pre Plus is one of the best phones on the market for browsing the web. It also supports real multi-tasking and is a powerhouse of a phone. It utilises Palm’s in house OS called webOS. It has a very sharp display and a really nice design. It feels pretty solid to use and doesn’t suffer much jerkiness like the earlier versions of a lot of Palm’s phones. It is a nice phone to use for work, play or experimentation. </p>
<p> In Summary </p>
<p> These phones are not the be all and end all in regards to smart phone technology; if I had the time I could probably expand the list to over twenty smart phones which are worth considering. </p>

<p> Terrible app. I keep restarting and tweaking it more than I use it normally because it can’t be bothered to pop up notifications most of the time. </p>

<p> Nubia Alpha Smartwatch Launched with Flexible OLED Display </p>
<p> A few days back Nubia teased its Alpha smartwatch and now it has launched the device in China. Back in CES 2019, the Nubia Alpha smartphone was showcased and was announced a few weeks later at the MWC 2019. As of now, the device will be sold only in China and it has also said it will be selling the device in a few other markets like Asia, Europe, and North America. This smartwatch with eSIM will be exclusive to the Chinese market and the other markets will be limited to Bluetooth variant only. </p>
<p> Well, Nubia partnered with Visionox to manufacture flexible displays which are made up of 11 layers and it is a 4.01-inch flexible OLED display with 960 x 192 pixels resolution. The device will be coming out of the box with a custom OS which is also called Alpha OS along with many custom features. To power this smartwatch there is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 2100 chipset coupled with 1GB of RAM. Since it is not a phone it won’t be getting a full a graphics card and a few other options we find on a smartphone. </p>
<p> To power the smartwatch there is a 500mAh battery which will last for a day or two. There are thick bezels on the sizes of the display which comes with sensors and there is 8GB of onboard memory for storing music and installing few apps. Furthermore, the handset has a 5MP camera sensor with an 82-degree wide-angle view along with f/2.2 aperture size. It also supports touches gestures via the sensors on it by which the users can just wave on the top of it to control it. </p>
<p> Unlike other smartwatches in the market, there is no heart rate monitor nor a built-in GPS on the device to track the fitness activities. The eSIM variant will also be getting 4G LTE connectivity and it would be sad to know that the eSIM variant is only limited to China. The device also leaks any durability for water since it is not certified which is also a drawback to the device since it is just splash proof. Although it can be used to make contactless payment we should see how secure it would be. </p>
<p> The Nubia Alpha with the support for eSIM is priced at CNY 3499 (approx US$ 520) while there is also an 18k Gold variant of the device that is priced at CNY 4499 (approx US$ 670).

<p> The company through a blog post said that “With the OnePlus 2, the fingerprint sensor is done right. It’s refined and lightning quick, unlocking your device faster than TouchID. The average person checks their phone over 200 times per day. If you spend just three seconds inputting a PIN number or pattern, that’s over an hour of your time gone each week. On the OnePlus 2, one quick tap takes you right to your home screen. With the ability to store up to five fingerprint profiles, it’s fast, it’s safe, and it’s secure. Your smartphone is your most personal device, and its security should be personal, too.” </p>

<p> Prevent Distractions while Driving from Calls, Texts with OneTap App </p>
<p> Whenever we come across a good app, we try to share with our readers, and aware them about what’s best and why it is a good decision to use that app. This time around we are doing the same. Recently, we come across a particularly very interesting app that would let you be a less distracted when you are behind the wheels. The driving accidents due to distraction are among the top causes of being in an accident. </p>
<p> Although, everyone likes to be involved on social apps via their smartphones, there is a precaution needs to be taken while doing that while driving a vehicle. People know that it’s a dangerous thing to use a smartphone while driving, so to avoid looking at those notifications or answer calls, there is an assistant that would help you get away from those distractions. </p>
<p> What are the features of OneTap? </p>
<p> The app when installed and setup on your Android smartphone would be able to detect the driving activity automatically, as well as you can set it up manually whenever you want with just one click. It will enter into driver mode and all the texts, phone calls, and even notifications from apps would be stopped giving you the perfect environment to drive with more attention on the road. Remember, you would have to set the drive time or enter your destination on the map, so that as soon as you reach the destination or the time is up, then you’ll be able to answer, as well as make calls. </p>
<p> Drive Time – But since it is called as a smart assistant, the company have integrated an interesting feature that would let people know that you’re behind the wheel and should expect a call back after your drive time ends. This all would be conveyed to the caller via SMS. As well as the caller can also leave a voice message if they wish to. </p>
<p> Passenger Mode – While it detects easily if you are on the move, you would have to enter into passenger mode manually, if you are riding shotgun or in the back seat of the vehicle. Then, you can use your smartphone normally, and OneTap app won’t take over your phone and block them. </p>
<p> Trip Summary – You would have a trip summary, as soon as it is over. It will let you know what calls, texts and other app notifications you have missed while driving behind the wheel. Moreover, it also lets you connect with friends and family and share drive status with them. You can also watch over your kids and assure that they are driving without distractions, if not, then you can launch the app on their device remotely, you just need a one-time setup for controls. </p>
<p> Urgent Notification – In some cases, the calls are urgent, so, OneTap uses One2One Urgent Connect technology, where emergency contacts would be allowed to reach through to you via the OneTap app or either text code. This should only be used during emergencies, and it is recommended that you should stop the vehicle and park it, and then only respond to the emergency alert. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> This is something that every person should install on their smartphone if they drive a lot. It can be a life savior in many cases, and then your family and friends can talk after you’ve reached your destination. You should install this app and be a less distracted driver.

<p> Review: Opera for Android brings Turbo mode for data saving, better experience </p>
<p> The Internet still isn’t free, or even cheap, as we talk of it, and you are charged quite a lot for every MB of data downloaded on devices, either computers, smartphones, IoT devices or anything. Accessing every website costs something, and for this very reason, the users try and find the best browser that delivers the website content by consuming lesser data, only if possible. </p>
<p> Or the least they expect, is that the browser doesn’t give up on the page before downloading and rendering the content. That, if happens, is due to some reasons, including a slow and unstable network connection, low internal storage on the device or the website being too heavy for the browser to handle. One such company that has worked hard, we can safely say, for decades now, to give a stable and good browser in computers – Opera. </p>
<p> The same company has been having an Opera Mini browser, since quite long and that was one very recommended mobile browsers even from the time Symbian OS was around. A lot has changed since then, especially with the smartphone operating systems, Android OS taking over everything else, and it is good to see that Opera Mini has made quite a progress from there. But, what has been made much better, is the Opera browser for Android. </p>
<p> Opera Turbo: If the network is slower than usual, the web pages still open and Opera takes advantage of the Turbo feature to load web pages faster in rough conditions. It uses its own technology, and lets the user choose the quality of images to save more data, because the browser compresses the data before loading the page. To get just the text content, the user can choose to just turn off loading the images. </p>
<p> Just like the other browsers for mobile, there is an option to change user agent, thus the web pages can be loaded as a full version, or a mobile version based on the availability for that particular website. </p>
<p> Speed Dial: This is where all the favourite sites are kept at a place, for the quick access The list can be edited any time. Search engines: While searching for a particular keyword, there is an icon on the right corner of the search bar letting the user choose between Google, Yahoo, Amazon, Dictionary.com, eBay, IMDb, and Wikipedia. Bookmarking / Saving: The Opera for Android lets the user add the page to Speed Dial, or “save for offline” reading so that the entire page can be opened when there is no Internet connectivity, or add to bookmarks. </p>
<p> Private browsing: In the section of tabs, there is an option of “Private tab” for someone wanting to browse without being tracked. It shows up in the same multiple tab area, but has a black border to differentiate itself from the normal tabs. </p>
<p> Video chatting: Due to the support for WebRTC, there is a possibility of doing video calls right from the browser if you are using a website for that. A need for a separate browser for that is removed. </p>
<p> HTML Rendering: The rendering is proper and a full web compatibility is provided by Opera for Android, so as to load Javascript heavy websites, even the ones like Google Maps, to work seamlessly on the browser. </p>
<p> Full screen browsing: The browsing of page is possible in a full screen mode, whenever the phone is used in landscape position, and only then an option is shown to expand the area and make it a full-screen view. </p>
<p> Discover: Using this feature, one can find some interesting things, if you aren’t specifically browsing any website. Here, the top stories are shown with thumbnails, and this isn’t controlled by the browser, as the user can choose to select the categories, one from Arts, Business, Entertainment, Food, Gaming, Health, Lifestyle, Living, Motoring, News, Science, Sports, Technology and Travel. The user can also localize by choosing a location to get news from, or can go with the Global option. </p>
<p> One of the great points about the Opera browser for Android, is that the layout can be changed. It can be either classic, phone, or tablet view based on how the navigation and viewing is wanted. Under the settings, the user can choose to individually clear saved passwords, browsing history, cookies and data. </p>
<p> Sharing the bookmarks is another great feature of the browser, though this is the same on Opera Mini for Android. Saving bookmarks is possible always, but sharing them is the best part here. Because, if you have liked some websites or have kept the links saved for any project of yours, the entire bunch of them from a folder can be shared using Opera for Android. </p>
<p> Our views on website loading and multiple tab usage: </p>
<p> The browser is very swift, and with “very”, we mean it. The major reason for that could be that the browser properly compresses the page before showing it to the user. We tried loading over 12 tabs at the same time, and it worked flawlessly without a glitch at any time. When the browser was closed and removed from even the background apps, the tabs stayed there and just load again when the browser is re-opened. </p>
<p> It is a beautiful carousel view with tabs showing the preview of the page, when you are switching or scrolling through the multiple tabs. </p>
<p> All in all, the Opera browser for Android is a complete browser. There are options that might not show up directly on the front page, but all the needed features are packed in. Private browsing, offline reading, bookmarking, multiple search engines, and Opera’s own Turbo feature to make the browsing experience better with faster connectivity and loading when the network is good. </p>
<p> Although there is Opera Mini also available for Android, this browser is a better alternative when you are on networks that have fast and stable internet connections. Mini, on the other side, will be one you might want to use when using data network rather than faster Wi-Fi. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Review: Opera Mini for Android compresses data on cloud for saving costs </p>
<p> Opera is one such name that anyone would have in mind, for a mobile browser, if they have been using smartphones since even before the major smartphone operating systems became well known. The Opera Mini browser had been there since the time Nokia was making Symbian OS based phones. It wasn’t more about saving data back then, as there was rarely any mobile browser that gave a good browsing experience, and Opera Mini filled that gap. Now, the newer updates for Android app of Opera Mini, concentrates more on saving data charges. </p>
<p> While Android users may note that there is an Opera for Android application in the Play Store, which might look almost the same, there are differences and that is where the Opera Mini comes into play for more compression and data saving, when compared to Opera browser. Let’s get into the details, on why Opera Mini can still be a browser for any Android smartphone – entry level to a top-end one. </p>
<p> Data costs these days cannot be afforded by everyone, and most of the network operators charge more on data usage while roaming. While you cannot totally stop using the Internet while traveling, using Opera Mini is a wise option to save as much you can, because the end data usage is lesser for the website you are opening, when compared to the same on any other mobile browser. Even against Opera browser for Android. With over 50 million users, in India this app is third in the list of top apps, only after Facebook and Twitter. </p>
<p> How does Opera Mini save data consumption? First, the browser will look for a mobile version of the website, and then it will compress the website on the cloud servers, before pushing the compressed version to the smartphone. The compression is so good that on average, about 90% data is saved, and for a website that is 1MB in size, the page loaded is about 100kb. </p>
<p> This is a newer UI that has been recently introduced, and it presents with a home page that has the Quick Dial and Discover section in the same page, while the tabbed browsing has large thumbnails in carousel view for those who wanted to switch between the tabs and have a preview of the page to get an idea about it. </p>
<p> Private browsing: There is private browsing available in the tab section, which can be used if you don’t want to track or save the browsing history. It differentiates itself from other tabs, by having a dark border. </p>
<p> Multiple search engines: The search bar allows the user to choose between Google, Wikipedia, IMDb, and Dictionary.com. </p>
<p> The Discover section lets the user choose a particular category and a location to get interesting stories from, if the default Top stories and U.K. as a location is not what you want. </p>
<p> RSS feed: The browser has an option to read RSS feeds of websites, and the options for the same are available in the settings of the browser. </p>
<p> Bookmark Sharing: Similar to what is in the Opera browser for Android, the Opera Mini allows sharing of the bookmarks folder, so that it is easier for you to let your friends or colleagues know about some important links for work. </p>
<p> Offline reading: The web page can be saved for reading later, so that there is no worry about closing the app anytime. The page stays there for offline reading, until the user removes it. </p>
<p> Similar to the Opera for Android browser, there are options to change the app layout (for normal, phone and tablet viewing). Similarly, the settings for browsing data clearing has individual options for saved passwords, browsing history, cookies and data. </p>
<p> The data savings tracker is something the user might love, for showing everything about the data browsed, data saved over the past few days, and based on that, sometimes they can try to change the data plan as the data consumption is very less. The tracker section lets the user choose between low, medium and high quality images for loading in web pages, or choose to not load images at all. </p>
<p> For the Indian users, where the browser is one of the popular applications for Android, the Opera Mini for Android supports Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu languages. </p>
<p> So, how good is the Opera Mini for Android? </p>
<p> While Opera for Android is a complete browser for Android smartphones, the Opera Mini will be a browser someone should use if there is improper data connection. It is that good, with the best part being its data compression happening on the cloud and not locally. </p>
<p> It has all the features that most of the smartphone browsers will have, but Opera Mini is a light browser that works well even on smartphones that are not well powered, but are made for Internet connectivity. </p>

<p> Earlier – Oppo Find 7 Android Phone to launch at MWC 2014 – Includes MEMS Camera & SD Card: Rumors – January 26,2014 </p>
<p> The Oppo Find 7 is rumored to be debuted at the Mobile World Congress 2014 event in Barcelona, Spain and it is said to be coming with the MEMs 13 mega-pixel main camera and also the SD card support. From what we have learned from all the earlier rumors and leaks, the Oppo Find 7 is coming with all these: 5.5-inch 2560 x 1440 “Super Screen 2.0” with a pixel density of 538ppi Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection Processor: 2.3Ghz Snapdragon 800 (MSM8974AB) quad-core 3GB RAM 16GB internal storage 4G LTE connectivity </p>
<p> Earlier: Oppo Find 7, the upcoming high-end smartphone was hinted to be launched with a 2K display on the official Oppo Facebook page. Oppo was the first company to introduce a 1080p HD phone, with the Find 5 at the end of last year. It could also be the first phone to get launched with a 2K display. </p>
<p> It is believed that the Find 7 will be around 5 to 5.5 inch display but it could surprise us with something bigger, may be 5.7 inch display! The resolution expected is a minimum 1080 FHD but thing that stuck me is the 2K display which will reduce the battery life (but Oppo is looking to improve the battery life). </p>
<p> This Smartphone is expected to get all glass like the Oppo R1 and going to be a sleek handset with a thin bezel with all new look. Since Oppo is going along with Qualcomm, even this one might get the Qualcomm processor, possibly a Snapdragon 805 which could clock at 2.3 Ghz and have an Adreno 330 GPU, which will be enough to take it through 2014. </p>
<p> This device is expected to launch without a SD cars slot because its predecessors, Oppo N1 and the Find 5 also dint have one. Memory options of either 16 GB or 64 GB will be provided for high range version. However RAM is considered to be at least 2 GB or it might go with 3 GB also, to compete with the devices instore for the 2014 market. </p>
<p> The first Phone to get a 13 mega pixel Sony Exmor sensor was Oppo Find 5, where the N1 was pretty much a photographer’s choice. Even the Oppo R819 hit the market with great camera for a low budget phone. So this time the expectations are for a 16 mega pixel camera or even get a rotating camera. It might also get many features which the market has not seen yet. The front camera might be a 5 MP camera to allow users to video chat while on the go. </p>
<p> Oppo had issues with the battery in the Find 5, so there might be an improvement this time around giving a bigger battery with 3000 mAh which could be built in. As all the flagships, even this device is also expected to get a 4G LTE, offering the same connectivity option as the Nexus 5 does, supporting major GSM, CDMA, HSPDA also. </p>
<p> This device is certainly going to be running on a heavily customized latest Android OS and will also get Oppo’s ColorOS as is previous versions. The pricing of this flagship model might vary depending on the versions. It is expected to be around $500-$550 for basic version and can touch up to $600 for high end model. </p>
<p> Anyhow these are our assumptions but most probable ones! We are expecting a roll out for the further updates and will keep you informed. I am pretty much excited about this phone, are you interested to grab one? Let us know by your comments and be connected with us for more information. </p>

<p> How to Try Paid Android Apps for Free from Android Market </p>
<p> Paid apps are most of the time at the best worth for the price, but sometimes just the hype makes people buy the applications which they didn’t want to. Many would want to check out what the app actually has, when they are paying an amount to purchase it. The price tag of $1 to $5 would usually not give people many thoughts but when they are to cash out something higher (there are even apps which are available for 3-digit figure amount), they would want to check out the features and see if the app is really worth paying or not. </p>
<p> There is a way how you could just try out the application before actually purchasing it. It would want you to pay for it initially but in the end you won’t waste your money when you didn’t like the app. The basic idea behind this tip is asking for the refund after purchasing the app, and as its a limited time within which you could ask for the refund, you get around 10 minutes to check out what the app has got and whether you would want to keep it installed or want a refund. </p>
<p> Here is how you can try out the application before you buy: </p>
<p> With the new Google Android market named Google Play, you can either login to it through your desktop or through the mobile phone. So for trying out the paid Android app, you would need to purchase the app. </p>
<p> Once you have purchased the app, launch it and use it for the next 8-12 minutes to try out the various features and decide whether the app has something that could impress you. </p>
<p> If you wish not to use the application after trying it out, go to the My Apps section and search for the application which you wanted to get refund for. Open its app page and hit Refund button and the app would be uninstalled from the phone and you would get the refund for the same. </p>
<p> You would see the following message in your mail box once the app is uninstalled: </p>
<p> You have uninstalled the application from your phone. We have cancelled your order and you have not been charged. </p>
<p> Nothing to panic if your OS is asking you for the reason why you wanted to uninstall the application and wanted the refund, you could select any of the option, or even better “I’d rather not say”. </p>
<p> Sometimes risky that you could get problems in asking for a refund if the 15 minutes are crossed, or a bad time when the internet connection isn’t working fine but nevertheless worth trying rather than always purchasing the application or trying to find some reviews to decide whether to purchase the application. </p>

<p> you can get the app permanently by making a backup of it using titanium backup and then refund it…now you have the paid app for free. </p>
<p> though this is not a trick but it created a trick in my mind after reading your article…woop now i get not all but many paid apps for free directly from android market…what i did was just purchased an app and as soon as it got installed i made that app backup with Astro file manager and hence .apk file got saved in my memory card…and after that i cancelled my order,i got my refund also and using that app also and for free </p>
<p> But wouldn’t Google be able to know this as during the update process they would get info on installed paid app vs no record in their inventory of you having purchased the app. </p>
<p> This would show you clearly as using a pirated app. Or is there a way to block that. </p>
<p> True but sometimes its useful for the users and if you tell users that this is a policy, rule or something like that no one would be interested in even knowing about it. </p>

<p> Other interesting features are its E-wallet function and digital TV tuner. Primary mobile phone functions like calendar, calculator, accessories and games are included by default on this phone moreover Android Marketplace is just one click away to make your phone limitless on the apps or games which you can install.

<p> So do you think that Panasonic LUMIX 101p Phone would make any impact on the buyers? How do you think Android with SLR camera will make any impact? </p>

<p> Best Password Manager App for Android with 256bit AES Security </p>
<p> If you are among those users on Android who stores passwords for encryption or authentication purpose, then its best advised to have a password manager. As a known explanation, Password Manager does the work of managing your login credentials to a secure mode. </p>
<p> When it comes to Android, the work is made easy using the apps available in Android Market. One such app which I came across is PassLock. The PassLock app for Android mobile phones provides a password manager using the 256 bit AES encryption. It keeps the passwords safe in your phone locally but not uploading them to server. </p>
<p> By using PassLock you can group set your password, move your passwords from one group to another, change the master password and also import/export your password database. This app is certainly straight forward and does the work as most of the password manager software does. Yeah, I agree that it keep its plain and simple with managing password unlike other apps always try to provide a lot of thing under one roof but they make it complicated to work. Finally you can export or import your login credentials for the backup of it. </p>
<p> The cut off for the Android users comes as this app only supports handset which runs the Android 2.3 and higher versions, that means that users with Android Froyo or lesser OS wouldn’t be able to taste it. </p>
<p> PassLock app Download </p>
<p> The PassLock app can be downloaded from Android apps labs for free and supported on many of the Android mobiles. </p>

On the Galaxy Gear 2, users can pay at local stores, save money and redeem offers and also receive payment notifications and check the balance on the Gear 2 device using this PayPal app. </p>
<p> Samsung and PayPal merged up and it was announced in Barcelona Spain earlier this year in the MWC 2014 event. They announced that Samsung Galaxy S5 users will be the first to login and shop at any merchant that accepts PayPal on Mobiles and in-store just with the fingerprint making PayPal the first global payment company to support Samsung’s mobile fingerprint authentication technology. </p>
<p> Customers can use their finger to pay with PayPal from their new Samsung Galaxy S5 because the FIDO Ready software on the device securely communicates between the fingerprint sensor on their device and PayPal’s service in the cloud. The only information the device shares with PayPal is a unique encrypted key that allows PayPal to verify the identity of the customer without having to store any biometric information on PayPal’s servers – said John Lunn from PayPal Developer Network. </p>
<p> With this PayPal app we can now pay bill easily by accessing to the PayPal account and we will have the required security with the fingerprint scanner, giving us more luxury to use it.

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> The Best Free Pedometer Step Counter Apps for the Nexus 5 </p>
<p> The big list of features that the Android 4.4 KitKat came with, included the support for Pedometers and the Nexus 5 which was just launched, has the pedometer embedded in itself, thus you can take full advantage of it to count the steps you make to keep yourself fit and fine. Earlier to this, we had loved the feature on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and Note 3, but they could do the step counting using the S Health app, a property of Samsung. Unfortunately, there is no real good step tracker app available, especially when we talk of the battery usage. </p>
<p> Below we have listed a few step counter apps which take advantage of the Pedometer in the Nexus 5, but mind you, most of them drain the battery quite a lot. And the one which I saw draining more battery than the others is an app that we always recommend for the fitness tracking. </p>
<p> Runtastic Pedometer </p>
<p> The Runtastic Pedometer counts every step of yours and the job doesn’t end there because based on the walk, it would tell you the count of the number of steps, the duration of the walk and based on that, the speed in kph, the distance in km or miles. There are loads of settings, but many would be available only if you upgrade to the Pro version, and if you check the list below, you’ll find there is no way to pay and upgrade. </p>
<p> Advantages of the Runtastic Pedometer – </p>
<p> It is very much accurate when compared to the other free apps available </p>
<p> Total distance calculation with time, removes the need for other fitness apps </p>
<p> Little history, with the past five walks recorded and saved for your comparison </p>
<p> Disadvantages of Runtastic Pedometer – </p>
<p> Battery drainer – It drains a lot of battery, and the app itself says that I have to keep the screen turned on if the tracking has to go well. </p>
<p> The Pedometer Lite from Runtastic is a free one in the Play Store: Link </p>
<p> Noom Walk: Pedometer </p>
<p> The Noom Walk pedometer app claims to calculate steps more accurately, and the main advantage here being the battery life. It doesn’t drain a lot of battery when compared to the other apps but I had a big issues with the count because after the test walk of 100 steps, I hardly walked for around 100 more steps and then was off in a car. But after reaching a place and checking it, the app showed more than 8000 steps. Noom Walk does nothing else than counting the steps, but I am not sure how good it does after the unknown 7000+ steps were added. It is only good when you force close the app and open it only when you are about to walk. </p>
<p> Let’s you stay private </p>
<p> Download Noom Walk Pedometer from Play Store: Link </p>
<p> Pedometer 2.0 </p>
<p> The Pedometer 2.0 does quite a lot more than the above two apps because you get to see some options like the speed in graphics display, a diary recording all the movements and the final analysis showing the stats of the walk. Thus, the functioning doesn’t end with just the steps counting. One of the good things I found in this is the different modes – Accelerometer mode where the steps are counted, the GPS mode where the distance is calculated and the Time mode where the calories burning is checked based on the type of exercise. </p>
<p> Advantages of the Pedometer 2.0 app – </p>
<p> Many features like calorie burning </p>
<p> Analytical check charts for daily activities </p>
<p> Different modes for step, distance, calorie burn count </p>
<p> Phone has to be held in hand, although sensitivity is set at high </p>
<p> Comparatively high battery consuming, as it doesn’t work well in background </p>
<p> You can download Pedometer 2.0 and give it a try – Play Store Link </p>
<p> WalkLogger pedometer </p>
<p> This is a similar one to the Pedometer 2.0 but this works in the background. Having that said, I found it to be lacking some accuracy, as it too showed my car driving distance as steps, and on day one it was somewhat good at 4 miles, the next day it showed 14 miles (how could I walk that much?). But later, it was pretty good, but not that trustworthy if I am to make a perfect log and check for regular distance and calorie burning. </p>
<p> Advantages of Walklogger Pedometer </p>
<p> Motivational – You get different app themes when you reach particular number of steps, and that sometimes helps in making you walk more </p>
<p> Hills and bar charts – Good to show you how the activity is, every hour </p>
<p> Doesn’t drain a lot of battery </p>
<p> Disadvantages of Walklogger Pedometer </p>
<p> Problem with accuracy, as said with the example above </p>
<p> Doesn’t count the steps right away, you might have to waste 4-8 steps before it actually starts counting </p>
<p> Download the WalkLogger Pedometer and install it from Play Store: Link </p>
<p> Moves </p>
<p> This app counts your steps, and along with that it takes the help from GPS to track the walk and the paths you took to walk around. It tracks the different activities such as walking, running and cycling and it is quite simpler than the other apps, but you are going to see a lot of battery drain with this, and while testing all these five pedometer apps, I saw Moves taking around 28% of the battery, just like the Runtastic Pedometer. But if you are fine with it, the accuracy of the counting is good. </p>
<p> Shows the paths </p>
<p> Pedometer with Dashclock extension </p>
<p> This is one of the simplest apps which would do the step counting and it uses the hardware step-sensor for a better battery consumption. It also come with DashClock extension which would do the checking for the steps and activity tracking easier. For the motivation, there is Google+ account logging in to unlock achievements and compete with others on the leaderboard. </p>
<p> There are a lot of other apps too, but we tried to mention only the ones which were recommended by many experts around, and tried to check where these apps are good at, and where they are disadvantageous for the fitness freaks. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> How to Perform Bootloader Unlock Process on your Phone </p>
<p> For quite a period of time, we have been hearing on the things about the bootloader, isn’t it? So, in the due course of this article we will not only see on what is Bootloader but also we will see on how you can perform the bootloader unlocking process on your htc smart phone. If you kept hearing all these days things about the bootloader and didn’t know then this is actually a tool which processes the system software on the phone and finds the series of processes which run in the phone. It’s actually nothing but a program which controls all the applications which run at the startup itself. </p>
<p> Now, up next you may now ask, since Android is an Open source platform then what is the role of Bootloader in this. Most of the companies just like htc, Motorola, Sony Ericsson etc. believes that with boot loaders in place they can protect the malicious software coming into the device which may hamper the overall smart phone experience. Though if as a user wishes to get unlock this bootloader can proceed with the same but after that the warranty will get void as company feels that when as a user is capable of customizing then what is the use of support which is provided by company. </p>
<p> Generally all the HTC Devices come with the S – ON feature which is nothing but the Security ON feature. So, in this article we will be checking about on how you can unlock the HTC Sensation bootloader as HTC Sensation is the first ever phone from htc which will get access to the official unlocking process which gives users and developers the ability to install custom ROMs on the phone. So, let’s now check out on how you can unlock the bootloader for the HTC Sensation with the help of the official HTC Dev tool of which we will provide you the brief overview. </p>
<p> Brief Outlook on the Process of Unlocking the bootloader: </p>
<p> Android SDK (Software Developer Kit) is used to run the fastboot command and request the device identifier token, </p>
<p> Then the identifier token comes out as an output to the PC Console, </p>
<p> Now, the user submits the device ID along with the token via the website HTCDEV.COM, </p>
<p> Once the same is validated, the unlock key is mailed to the user for the use,, </p>
<p> With the help of the unlock key, user unlocks the same by entering the Unlock command with unlock key. </p>
<p> As you can see the above flow path that it will take not more than a maximum of 30 minutes to finish the unlocking the bootloader process. The only major time eater here is to get the unlock key which involves the validation part. Another major time eater is the sync setup of ADB as well as the HTC Sync which nearly involves the ten steps to locate the phone’s unique identifier token (UIT) which are explained below in the form of images. </p>
<p> Procedure to Perform Bootloader Unlock Process on your HTC Sensation Android Phone: </p>
<p> Step 1: First up you need to re insert the battery from your phone as shown below, </p>
<p> Step 2: Now, you will have to Press the “Volume Down” and the “Power” button to start the device in the Bootloader mode. </p>
<p> Step 3: Using the “Volume Buttons” you need to select the up or the down option and choose the “Fastboot” option and press the power button. </p>
<p> Step 4: After this,you will have to connect the device with the help of the USB cable to the computer. </p>
<p> Step 5: Now, all you need to do is to just follow the below sequential process as you can see in the below mentioned image. </p>
<p> Step 6: Once you are done with the above processes, you will now have to open the command prompt and need to type int he “cmd” and press Enter key. </p>
<p> Step 7: After this you need to navigate to the location where you need to zip the file and teh go to the folder as mentioned in the below screen shot. </p>
<p> Step 8: In the command prompt, enter the below command which is shown below </p>
<p> Step 9: Up next you need to go the below mentioned path after which you will find the two screens as shown in the below screen capture. </p>
<p> Step 10: Last but not the least, you will now have to submit the order once the above processes are finished. </p>
<p> So, in this way you have successfully performed the Bootloader Unlock Process on your Phone by following thee above instructions. </p>
<p> I am trying to root my desire HD. I have followed the instructions to the letter. At stage 8 it says waiting for device for like forever. Is there any other way to root? </p>
<p> i have htc wildfire s , can i just S-off my gsm phone with it? actually i tried this method but then i am not geting ny token codes on d step (fastboot oem get_identifier_token) can you help me with it? </p>
<p> Many instructions in this thread are too vague. You need to be specific; for example: What is turning the “S” off. It takes hours to read through the mountain of details all of you produce. Have any of you heard of putting up the instructions in a single place and always updating the same as needed. </p>
<p> Pfunk </p>

<p> How To Personalize Settings on HTC Sense based Android Smart Phones </p>
<p> Customizing your Android smartphone the way you like it to appear like is one of the smaller features that’s used a lot on Android. Users like to customize their smartphones with new wallpapers, lock screen themes or just rearranging the icons on their homescreens with some new widget addons too. However, if you’re using a HTC Android Smartphone that runs the HTC Sense UI, the HTC Sense Version on Android 4.1 and above has made it difficult to get to the personalization option as easily as before. </p>
<p> To get around this and reach personalizing your homescreen as quickly as you can, there’s a easy way to go about doing it. Two of them, actually. Read further to get it working on your HTC Sense enabled phone instantly: </p>
<p> Proceedure </p>
<p> Method 1 </p>
<p> When your phone is unlocked, pull down the notification bar. </p>
<p> Tp the settings icon in the top left corner. </p>
<p> Now, scroll down to the “Personalize” option and tap on it. </p>
<p> Method 2 </p>
<p> It’s also noted that the Personalize option is present in the Settings menu of the phone. </p>
<p> Thus, add the Settings option to your homescreen directly by holding the Settings app from the app tray. </p>
<p> Once settings is added to your homescren, you can tap on it and hit personalize inside directly. </p>
<p> These are two simple, yet efficient ways of hitting the personalization option as quickly as possible on your Android smartphone. Using it on the long run would be effective in having your wallpapers and other custom options changed quicker than the usual way. Do let us know if you find any other workaround for the same too! </p>

<p> Photo Printer for Android Devices – Print Pictures at Home </p>
<p> For many years having an Apple product was a dream and still the craze goes on. The Google powered Android entered into the market and the fight is ON. Since the high-end smartphones comes with 8 mega pixel camera a lot of people prefer to take pictures on their phone rather than taking out their digital camera. </p>
<p> Taking photos with the devices always available on their hand is convenient and fun but the task of selecting them and printing is out of your patience. The good news is that Mobile Printer APRi is launched and it prints the pictures from any mobile phone with much hassle to work around. </p>
<p> As the name itself indicates Mobile Printer APRi is a printer for mobile phones but what exactly mobile mean here? The mobile is not movable or nowhere related to mobility but it’s about the capability of the printer to print documents from various mobile phone supported by it. </p>
<p> Using your Android phone you can print photo directly. You just have establish connection between your phone and the printer by placing the phone on the dock provided in the printer or using USB connectivity. Browse the photos on your phone and click on Print to get quick print of this printer. But the only limitness which I find in this printer is that it only supports printing of JPEG photos and no other format is supported. The APRi photo printer uses the Dye sublimation thermal transfer method of printing the photos and output print resolution is 300 dpi x 300 dpi. The printer at first is provided with a trial of 12 photo prints of 150 mm x 100 mm. </p>
<p> The users who are looking to print from their Android devices, they should install ‘Bolle Photo’ apps available for download on the Android Market. </p>
<p> This Century APRI photo printer supports iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 3G, iPod touch, iPod touch, iPod touch, iPad, iPad 2 and any other Android OS phone. The printer weights 1.4 kgs and includes separate black and color cartridges. </p>

<p> Play .Avi or .Mkv or any Video File Format on Android with RockPlayer App </p>

<p> Despite changing settings, Rockplayer Lite does not see /ext_card on Android’s 4.1.2 file system. Skip. </p>
<p> both vlc and rockplayer lite are useless, the picture is shown with graphic artifacts and it also lags. A player called arcMedia Redux is what you need, it’s UI is crap but it does the job perfectly. </p>

<p> Play HD Files on Android Phones – FLV, AVI, MKV, MP4, OGM Supported </p>
<p> Until the Android arrived, we used to check what audio and video formats do the phone supports. The phone used to support few formats only and infact users had to convert those video on the web using the converter softwares to the format which is supported on their mobile phones. Mostly users had been looking for the 3GP format as it was the widely accepted format by most of the phones and devices. But as Android has arrived the game has changed completely and with the Android now you can play almost all the formats thanks to Android Market that many apps and players are available. </p>
<p> But there are certain requirements to play supported audio and video formats as they should be atleast on the Gingerbread OS first and the next thing few applications might require to have the root access on to your phone. If it doesn’t ask well and go, you can straightaway install and use the application. Other thing your phone should have minimum hardware so as to push the high content played efficiently. The Android phones with 600 MHz processor are able to play the video but gives you disappointing results and 800 MHz single core would be sufficient enough to get good results while playing high graphics good. Of course if you have high-end smartphones then you don’t need to check this out. </p>
<p> Mobo Player </p>
<p> The Mobo Player is the best application for audio and video playback in terms of interface, browsing and playback quality. This is a free application capable of playing most the audio and video formats. Along with that it will support most of the subtitle such as SRT, ASS and SAA for the video formats like MKV, MPV and MOV. </p>
<p> The Mobo player has the following advantages and features – </p>

<p> If you have high-end smartphones then I guess you might be having the lot of HQ content. The Seamen player is one such application available for Android phones for free which supports the playback of HQ files along with the normal files and formats. Good thing is that it also supports Android 2.2 Froyo based phones too. </p>
<p> Using Seamen player you can play files like Mp4, Flv, AVI, MKV, OGM, OFF, WAV, 3GP, FLAC, MPC, AMR, ALaw, MP2, Midi, ADPCM, etc., and high quality video formats like H.263, H.264, AVCHD, MPEG-1, MPEG-4, DivX, Xvid, WMV, MJPEG, MSVIDEO, SVQ1, SVQ3 and others. </p>

<p> MX video player all the way. It plays anything and everything. I love the volume boost and the different screen sizes to fit your particular cell phone. swipe up on the screen for volume up and down, no fumbling for buttons. It makes an avi of xvid quality look like a 720 mp4 file. and of course it plays mp4, mkv, avi, 3gp 3g2, mov, flv, m4v, pretty much anything you can throw at it. Its by far the most superior player </p>
<p> moreover, you can go to extension file in setting of mx player and key in which ever format you want to open….. example is if you dont want a video to be seen, just rename the extension (.mp4 or whatever to .23 or whaever), and if you want to watch the video, just go to file extension in mx player setting and type 23 to make the file visible and playerable and you can remove it from the list when you’re done !!! MX player is like the VLC of Android 😉 </p>
<p> the seamen video thing froze my phone while the video was playing the seamen is waste of time trust me </p>
<p> today i install mobo player its not working satisfactory hanging problem for HD video from Samsung Galaxy Y. please inform me which is the best player supporting HD videos. </p>
<p> today i install mobo player its not working satisfactory hanging problem for HD video from Samsung Galaxy Y. please inform me which is the best player supporting HD videos. </p>
<p> mobo player is the worst player i have ever used.It had not played even one video and hanged my galaxy ace badly.Now uninstalling……….. </p>
<p> i have installed mobo player and it has been hanging 2 to 3 times when iam trying to watch a movie………..not good </p>
<p> i installed Mobo player yesterday, it is just great. The user interface is quite good and plays all formats like MKV, avi, mp4,mpg etc. It is also ad free unlike MX player. </p>
<p> Just google search Step by Step Guide on How to Play 720p, 1080p MKV on Android Tablets or Phones </p>
<p> you will find a step by step guide on how to successfully play HD MKV in 720p or 1080p on all kinds of Android based smart phones and tablet computers </p>
<p> i have a Samsung galaxy fit running android 2.2………the video does not play fluently ……….any suggestions?? 🙂 🙂 </p>
<p> Mobo players works awesome.. i use it on my xperia x8… it is easy to use also with just simple touches on screen to adjust brightness, volume and fast forward.. </p>
<p> just to point out , You’ll get all these features in MXVP as well !! but which one to use, is all up to you and you only ! </p>
<p> MXVP is still not matured enough app, that was the only reason we didn’t choose it among the two. </p>
<p> i installed Mobo player yesterday, it is just great. The user interface is quite good and plays all formats like MKV, avi, mp4,mpg etc. It is also ad free unlike MX player. </p>
<p> MX Video Player is also good one compared to Mobo Player. In my Galaxy Ace, I felt some videos went out of sync with audio while using Mobo Player, while i dint experience same in MXVP. Also, It supports all those features in Mobo Player + multi-touch zoom. I bet everyone will love that, but yes the UI of Mobo Player is far impressive than MX Video Player. but as far as video players r concerned, it shud satisfy wat it claim, which I feel MXVP does it better than MVP. </p>
<p> Totally agree with you.. plus mobo is installed on phone memory and mx can be installed on sd as well.. 🙂 </p>

<p> Pre-Order Galaxy S III in India at Official Samsung eStore for Rs 2000 </p>
<p> The next Galaxy Phone is here and its making wider appearance starting from June 1, 2012 available in various countries. In Russia, Galaxy S III will be available from June 2, 2012. But many mass users in India are eager what would be the price of Samsung Galaxy S III and when it will arrive. Well this article will certainly close the discussion as we bring you the price and the availability details of the handsets. According to reports this revolutionary smartphone has received around 10 million pre orders from 100 carriers around the world and this information comes from unknown Samsung official. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S III GT I 9300 India </p>
<p> Samsung India eStore an official Samsung store online have listed the next Samsung Galaxy phone to be available for pre order booking. But Samsung India didn’t make it clear what would be the price of the device and its right now available for the pre order by paying Rs 2,000 and this will be issued as the coupon code to you providing Rs 2,000 discount when the original price of the handset is revealed. I guess the price of this smartphone is not known because of the fluctuating dollar to rupee conversion rate. </p>
<p> The phone should be expected at Rs 35,000 price and it seems that without listing the final price it would be hard for someone to pre book the device, true and accepted fact. Hope Samsung sells the device at Rs 30,000 in order to increase its sales over HTC One X and other pretty good selling phones but looking at Galaxy Note priced at Rs 32,000 right now, the price of S III will be certainly higher than Galaxy Note. </p>
<p> Do make a note that you get a option to pay directly or in EMI’s which would be paid on the name of Savex Computers Limited. Once done you will get a confirmation of the Order as shown above. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S III comes with the 4.8 inches Super AMOLED HD display screen and power packs 1.4 Ghz Exynos quad core processor which is one of the fastest and the best. It has the pre installed Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich OS with the Samsung’s TouchWiz user interface. This comes with 1 GB of RAM along with the 8 mega pixel camera and 2 mega pixel front facing camera. The latest feature of NFC, Wi Fi tether, Wi Fi Direct are pre installed here and there is a micro SD card slot which support storage up to 64 GB in size along with 2100 mAh battery acting along. </p>
<p> Also Galaxy S III will be launched with different versions like GT I9300G and the normal version in India along, so if you are buying a Galaxy S III smartphone do check out for the model version written on the pack. Though both the model doesn’t make any difference but it might cause confusion over the firmware upgrades that you receive. We would hear more in the coming days about Galaxy S III phone. </p>

<p> True and thats what we have posted in the article. Samsung should have mentioned the price atleast because launch date is not far. </p>

<p> Android Advices </p>
<p> Privacy Blocker App to Scan & Secure Personal Info </p>
<p> Applications are part of our Life and when it comes to Android, its necessity more than the need as without applications Android is un imaginable as after all Android phones are smart by default. There have been many instances where applications gather personal information from us which sometimes applications reveal the same but do you know there are some applications which do compile all of ours personal information and store the same in their respective servers for later use. As of now there is no mechanism to monitor such kind of privacy limiters as only a handful of applications like twitter etc. employ highest safety standard like OAuth etc. which are highly secured and safe. </p>
<p> Privacy Blocker is basically the only app that can fully lookout for apps that steal your private information and may be harmful. It is unlike any other app in that it can actually scan through other apps code to find privacy issues. The best part of this application is that most of the required features are also there in the free version, so you don’t have to pay for the application. Also, most importantly this is the only application in the Android Market Place available till date which can do these below stated features. After scanning for potential violations, Privacy Blocker can actually fix the problems that are in the apps. After fixing you can install the secure app directly on your device without having to worry about all from within Privacy Blocker. </p>
<p> So, let’s check out an Android application which is dubbed as Privacy Blocker and another similar applications which is called as Privacy Inspector which can both help you to secure your personal data as well as information by revealing all the safe fixes and information access by any application which is stored on your Android phone. You can have a look at the features of these both applications which are mentioned below, </p>
<p> Features of Privacy Blocker & Privacy Inspector </p>

<p> View details accessed by applications </p>
<p> Install and backup facilities for limited applications </p>
<p> Share results via facebook, twitter & Email </p>
<p> One stop uninstall station to uninstall unwanted applications </p>
<p> If you compare this one with any other security applications like AVG or any other security suites then this is the most efficient one as while others can’t find and fix such threats, this Privacy Blocker app does everything perfectly. </p>
<p> You can easily scan all the applications separately or in a batch them and then you can view PB offer you a set of recommendations of items which is stumbled upon. From there, you can tell the app to “fix” anything it found any problems. To “fix”, you will see that PB appears to uninstall the bad app and either re-package or somehow trick the app on a re-install so that the same information is no longer accessed by that particular application. </p>
<p> How to use Privacy Blocker & Privacy Inspector: </p>
<p> First up, you will have to open Android Market Place and then search for “Privacy Inspector” application after which you will have to tap on “FREE” and then on “OK” to download and install the application shown below. </p>
<p> Now, depending upon the data connection speed, the application will be downloaded and the same you can see in the below screen shot. </p>
<p> Next up after downloading the application, go into “Applications” from your home screen and choose Privacy Blocker Application and after which you will see a home screen as shown below, </p>
<p> After opening the application for the first time, you will see some welcome terms which you can have a glance and after that you just need to simply tap on the “Ok” tab after which you will have to tap on the “Scan for apps” tab after which this application will be scanning for all the applications which are present in your device as shown below, </p>
<p> Supposedly if you select the facebook to check whether its secured or not then it will scan for any vulnerabilities if there are any. After selecting the application you need to select the first option at the bottom of the applications window as shown in the above screens shot after which the over all security will be shown, which in this case is “Ok”. Now, when you press the Menu key then you will see that youi can send these details or share the same to other medias as well in the form of mail or via twitter and facebook. </p>
<p> Now, if you come down to the application window, you will find that after pressing the “Menu” Key, you will get 4 options which are Menu / Select, Scan Apps, Settings and also the Help. So, if you choose the “Settings” then you will see that a whole range of settings window open up as shown in the below screen shot, you can now choose from the customizations as per your choice. </p>
<p> So, that’s it after choosing the right set of options in the Settings option, you will be easily able to set the preferences of your choice and that’s it you have successfully installed and learnt on how you can use the Privacy Inspector application, in the same way you can also install the Privacy Blocker application which is almost the same application just like the Privacy inspector, the only difference being is that the Privacy Blocker application is a paid version application.

<p> How to Protect your Android Phone Applications using Password – App Lock </p>
<p> Every smartphone user has multiple apps installed, with many messenger apps and photo apps we would like to have some privacy regarding people peeping into our personal lives. And with people who have children who take your phone for playing games of watching cartoon movies it is very essential to have a lock on apps and even the app store preventing them from buying new apps without our permission, it helps you by letting you give space to your children without always keeping an eye on them while they use your phone. When you are in a hostel or are constantly with friends privacy becomes a big issue when everyone wants to peep into your personal stuff like your call history, messages etc </p>
<p> There is an App just for this called “App Lock” which lets you lock your apps with a password or pattern type of lock when anyone tries to open an app which is locked using App Lock. Features of App Lock Application: </p>
<p> Allows you to Lock individual applications or selected applications in your smartphone. </p>
<p> A Pattern or Password lock is used for unlocking to use any application </p>

<p> After entering the password you will be asked to set a Security question and a Security answer and a Password hint which is optional to be safe in case you forget the password which you set. After you have set the security question and answer and saved the setting you will be directed to a page where you can see 2 options on top of the page General and Advanced under General you will be seeing a list of all your installed apps and the option beside each app to lock them separately.

<p> Protect SMS, Gallery, Facebook with Face Recognition App </p>
<p> By downloading Visidon AppLock app on your Android mobile phone you would be adding a security level on your mobile. It’s a security app which protects with face recognition means you instead of normal password for the apps or galleries or files, you would be using your face to unlock those files. </p>
<p> With this app you can choose which app to protect. Anything which you like to keep secured or private such as email, phone settings or calendar can be covered with this app. Once you install this app on your mobile phone it would show you a full list of installed apps on your handset. By checking on apps you would be able to lock them with security lock and to unlock it you need to show your face. With this app on your mobile phone you would be no longer to require inputting password. </p>
<p> The very good thing which I liked about this app is it can choose to protect anything, i.e., it can lock itself. This setting is for the much secured users who would like to have advanced task manager and this application does that. </p>
<p> Under the settings options of this app you find a lot of options to set lock on files. The setting covers setting up a normal password, face recognition password mode and option to set security level. Also setting for the camera too available under the settings tabs. </p>
<p> This app uses the front camera on your mobile device and its compatible with Android 2.3 Gingerbread OS supported mobiles. That filters out the usage of the mobile as this app will not work for the devices which runs the Android Froyo 2.2 and also it will not work for those devices which doesn’t have a front camera. </p>
<p> Here is the video demo showing the working of the app – httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FVWmeuj3T4 </p>

<p> Punjab National Bank App for Android – Review, Features and Problems </p>
<p> The Punjab National Bank is the third largest bank in India in terms of asset size and the bank has launched its mobile application with the name of PNB mBanking (869 KB in size for the version 11). The application requires Android version of 1.6 and above for installation. </p>
<p> Before one can login to the application he has to subscribe for the mobile Banking Services by filling and submitting the application form number PNB 1167 at any of the PNB bank’s branches. The login details (the login ID will be present on your passbook) should be collected from the same branch on intimation from the branch. Upon logging in the Customer is presented with the following options to perform. </p>
<p> 1. View Account Details like viewing the current balance 2. Request for a Account Statement or simply view his last 10 transactions 3. Transfer Funds 4. Inquire about the status of his cheques 5. Block the payment of cheques 6. Request for a new Cheque Book 7. Send email to the Relationship Manager 8. Change the Login and Transaction Password </p>
<p> The PNB has a 24 hour dedicated Customer care channel for the mobile banking related questions at a Toll Free number of 1800 180 2222 and also the mobile application is protected and secure through a 128 bit encryption. </p>
<p> Issues frequently faced/reported with the application: 1. The task of registering with the bank to use the mobile application is a little hectic for most of the users. 2. The list of compatible devices is very less 3. Very less features offered from the bank. 4. The amount of automation provided with the app is at a very low level. 5. Frequent Error messages and alert box messages pop up while using the app. 6. Reports of frequent app crashes and screen freezing. </p>
<p> Although the app does quite a lot of work such as sending funds to other accounts and more, there are several problems as listed above, and only when the bank notices these and rectifies them for a better user interface, we would be able to recommend this app to the bank account holders for an easier banking. </p>

<p> How to Use QR Codes to Share Contacts & Install Android Apps </p>
<p> Did you ever come across those square barcodes and on website, visiting cards and on products? Did you ever wonder how they actually works and why are they meant for? Well today we will go through the barcodes ie., the QR Code and where we use this barcodes. </p>
<p> QR Code basically are the two dimensional square barcodes which has data inside it, it may be a website link or phone number or the text but mostly users use to refer to a website. Many phones comes with bar code scanner application, one you ON that it will go through camera application so that it can scan the QR code. Many sites provide QR codes so that users can quickly scan through the code and visit the site without typing anything. So you just need an Android phone with built in camera and barcode scanner application which can be found on the Android PlayStore for free. Its quite easy to create a QR Code on the web and there are various sources by which you can generate QR Code for your site, product, application, link or picture or anything which is one the web in the URL format. Some of the major applications that we have gone through usage of barcode are the installing of Android Apps. </p>
<p> Using the Bar Code </p>
<p> First you need to install the application dedicated for scanning the QR Codes. There are numerous number of Android applications available on the Android Play Store for free and paid as well. We recommended using the Norton Snap Android applications on your device because this application protects you from scanning the dangerous and harmful QR codes. Since you don’t know what might be the source URL, you should stay with secure and safety and so is why Norton Snap is the recommended one. Along with that there are other applications such as Barcode Scanner, Barcode reader and ShopSavvy Barcode Scanner. </p>
<p> Installing Applications using Bar Code </p>
<p> Once when you see a Barcode, open the barcode application on your mobile phone and the place the camera towards the QR code. </p>
<p> When you points towards the square barcode, flashing red lines are been displayed on the screen of your phone. You need to centre the QR code and please don’t move your camera too much as it will require a constant few seconds scanning. </p>
<p> When the barcode is finished reading it will identify the QR code and will show the option to open browser, share via email and share via SMS. </p>
<p> It’s clear with those terms and if you have an Android App you will be forwarded to Android Play Store to the app link. Now you just need to click on Install option. For your easy understanding I have the Android Birds Rio Android applications by Rovio and here I am through that QR code. </p>
<p> You can share the QR code using Bluetooth, Email, Gmail, Google +, messaging, Social hub, Wi Fi direct. </p>
<p> So that quite easy to share with your friend but I think there will be not much applications for sharing. The QR code can come good when you have a advertising phamplet or broucher given to any one and the instead of provide URL, the bar code will provide quick access to the site. </p>
<p> Its just the beginning of the exploring the new world with Android and the bar code. </p>
