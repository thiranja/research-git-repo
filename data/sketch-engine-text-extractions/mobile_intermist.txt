<p> Top 5 instant messaging apps that protect your privacy! </p>
<p> This wild and feature-rich technology era we are living in has changed the way we stay in contact for good. The standard GSM SMS protocol is long behind, the instant messaging apps and VoIP calls took its place. They are widely popular, they have funny emoticons and multimedia features, and they are most of the time free to obtain and use. </p>
<p> However, while we are enjoying the group chats, sharing photos or trying to impose our opinionated thoughts on various subjects, we eventually think to ourselves: </p>
<p> Oh man, if _____ sees this, I’ll be in hell of a trouble. </p>
<p> And you have to know two things before you start deleting your chat history like a mad man conspiracy theorist. </p>
<p> Whatever you do, the privacy must be guaranteed to you. If you have doubts, stop using that app right away. </p>
<p> Most of the apps that are widely-acknowledged, with million users. are not up to the task when it comes to protecting your privacy rights. </p>
<p> Moreover, their security holes can result in loss of theft of personal data and credentials. Some of them can be used for marketing, others for cashing out your bank account. For that purpose, we prepared a list of those who can protect you. The ones that offer end-to-end encryption. Not exclusively the instant messengers we want, but the instant messengers we need. </p>
<p> Top 5 Free Instant Messengers for safe messaging </p>
<p> Wickr Me – Secure Messenger </p>
<p> Wickr is an alternative messenger that is based on end-to-end encryption. Additionally, it has a large area of features, with the majority of them committed to the privacy protection. As the developers stated, they don’t have any insights on sent or received messages and files, even the metadata. </p>
<p> The main privacy-specific features of Wickr are Shredder and Configurable Timer. Shredder lets you delete all your sent/received messages and files. With the Configurable Timer, you can set time expiration limit on all of your messages. Once they expire, they get shredded and sent to the dark oblivion of nothingness rather than to service provider storage. Too bad you’ll need to enter your phone number in order to register. </p>
<p> When it comes to the standard IM features, Wickr is simple and intuitive. The user interface offers simplistic workflow and you should get to know all the features in no time. Yes, you can send video, photo, and voice messages. The issues are occasional glitches and crashes (especially on Android). Of course, that should be resolved with upcoming updates. </p>
<p> Signal Private Messenger </p>
<p> Signal Private Messenger is an amazing open-source app that offers just what you need: end-to-end encrypted messaging for both SMS and instant messages. The first evident distinction from the other available solutions is open source nature of the app. Anyone can look up codes and determine is the app truly secure. Of course, that requires coding knowledge. Nevertheless, that doesn’t diminish the transparency, whatsoever. We, customers, have every right to demand it with every privacy-sensitive app. </p>
<p> As we already stated, all the text/media attachments you sent via Signal is encrypted and it can’t be stored on the server. Additionally, you can use it as a default SMS app and stay in touch with colleagues, family or friends that don’t use Signal. In order to log in, you’ll only need your number. The app, like many others, automatically syncs your contacts list from the address book. </p>
<p> Moreover, besides the standard IM features, Signal lately offers video and standard calls. That is a great thing since you can use one app for all the communication features you can possibly need. The only problems are the lack of support for tablets and missing desktop app for PC use. If we disregard those, Signal is possibly the best secure instant messenger you can get for free. </p>
<p> If you want to try Signal, it’s available for Android users here. iOS users can find it here. </p>
<p> Dust </p>
<p> Dust is an interesting app that is not like others. That can be good or bad, it solely depends on your taste. However, the app functionality and privacy protective features are well acknowledged. It is not as intuitive as Signal or as thorough as Wickr, but you can be safe knowing that your messages are secure and encrypted. </p>
<p> When it comes to security features, Dust offers standard end-to-end encryption with few additional tweaks. The same goes for all user privacy-oriented instant messengers: no one can see sent and received but you. Every Dust message is encrypted with its own unique 128-bit AES encryption followed with added security through RSA 2048-bit key. You can set expiry date for messages (even right after recipient read them), but they will eventually get deleted after 24 hours. In addition, you are safe from screenshots since your name is not visible while texting. </p>
<p> In other regards, UI and all-around usability are often sub-par in compare to its peers. Dust is simple to use but lacks some of the advanced features you would nowadays expect from an instant messaging app. With that in mind, this is a nice app worth trying, but it is behind its competitors in other departments except for privacy protection. </p>
<p> You can download Dust for Android here. And the iOS version is available here. </p>
<p> Threema </p>
<p> Threema is the unique privacy-oriented instant messenger with respectable security measures and a large variety of standard messaging features. In compare to others, it offers some interesting innovations while preserving end-to-end encryption that matters the most. </p>
<p> Firstly, you don’t need to enter email address nor phone number in order to register for Threema. Registration is done with the specific individual Threema ID. This is a great way to surpass accounts and use a traceless messaging. Besides end-to-end encryption, Threema stores or app related data to your device rather than a server. That way, no one can reach your sensitive data and all messaging participants are hidden. Messages are deleted right after the recipient reads them. It is just what you’ll need from a privacy-oriented app. </p>
<p> However, security is not all that Threema excels at. In addition to the simple and well-designed interface, Threema brings to the table all you can ask from an instant messenger. You can send text, videos, voice messages, and photos. Both in individual and group chats. Moreover, you can send a large variety of files that are commonly not available, like GIF, PDF, MP3, ZIP, and others. That can come in handy in a lot of ways. Threema also offers a pool feature. so your friends can vote on different subjects. In addition, Threema is available as a desktop app, so you can use it on multiple platforms. </p>
<p> In case you want to try out Threema on your Android, try here. Or if you are using iOS, go here. </p>
<p> WhatsApp </p>
<p> Well, everybody heard for WhatsApp! It started as a small project, gained massive popularity in no time, and ended up owned by Facebook. We are aware that Facebook is not best known for privacy protection. Actually, it is known for privacy intrusion scandals that are closely related to corporation data espionage and that NSA thing. However, WhatsApp and Facebook Messanger are not the same. WhatsApp is still most used instant messenger. And it seems that the privacy protection is finally getting some love. </p>
<p> Lately, WhatsApp finally implemented end-to-end decryption and stopped storing your data on their servers. WhatsApp now uses Open Whisper Systems security protocol (the one used on Signal). At least to some extent. The prying eyes of Facebook employees can still find out who is the sender or recipient. Simply put, they collect users metadata for various reasons. Besides that, all of the cloud backups will, by default, store your chat history. For that reason, it is better to disable that feature. </p>
<p> Well, you may ask what is WhatsApp doing on this list? Simply put, the other services are not as used as WhatsApp. Because of the two-way street that is instant messaging, both sender and recipient the same app. So, this last input is some kind of lesser evil. You trade partial privacy with small chance to endanger you for an app that is massively used around the world (more than 1 billion users). It would be great if those people choose Signal over WhatsApp but that is an unrealistic expectation. At least for now. </p>
<p> You can grab WhatsApp for Android here. iOS version is available. </p>
<p> Wrap up </p>
<p> As we all know, most of the apps have similar standard IM traits. But privacy and security are the most important ones and they are too often neglected. Well, the things are changing. Users now ask for better protection rather than flashy emojis. And these apps should serve you justice in that department. We hope you liked our list. </p>

<p> 8 GB RAM in smartphones: Massive step forward or unreasonable hardware race? </p>
<p> 8 GB? RAM? On a mobile phone? You know, that thing that we used for the simple communication and those nifty short messages 15 years ago. And not so long ago skeptics used to say that 3 GB of RAM is enough for your desktop computer. What will those folks say to this? Is there a real need for this massive hardware upgrade or the smartphone manufacturers are in any kind of creative block? </p>
<p> Maybe the race they are all partaking on yearly base has taken a toll on them. So, in order to differentiate the upcoming flagships from their already amazing predecessors, they had to make a bold move. Or is it a necessity, a way to response to demanding software in the upcoming years? </p>
<p> It is a Shakespearean doubt, indeed. So today, we will try and give our humble opinion. An insight if you want, and answer to this question: </p>
<p> Is the 8 GB RAM a need or a useless overkill? </p>
<p> PROS </p>
<p> Well, we all can agree that these massive hardware updates have ambiguous nature. They can be both improvement and disadvantage. Let us start with the positive features this change will enable. </p>
<p> More is often better in tech world </p>
<p> First and foremost, the software developers will get more working space. With certain constraints they had, software coding was, occasionally, an overdemanding task. The task many of them are not up to. We all know how the Facebook app is subpar in all kind of ways. Resources hogging, instability, crashes, slow loading speeds, you name it. And instead of remodeling the app itself, they somehow managed to make it worse with every new update. </p>
<p> Have in mind that we are talking about a giant in its niche, world leader, and not an individual developer coding in his basement with limited funds. RAM upgrade will let them concentrate more on the performance without hardware constraints. This will speed up the software evolution with the special emphasis on innovative individuals and their impact in the app market. </p>
<p> In case of demanding advancements: Insert RAM </p>
<p> In addition, there are a lot of new technologies that are heavily hardware-dependent. First thing that crosses our mind is Virtual Reality and all advanced improvements it can utilize. Since this is still a developing technology only the sky is a boundary for its final reach. In 2017 we can expect a lot of VR/AR presence in the gaming industry and that should impact all systems, even the handheld devices. </p>
<p> Another technology breakthrough that should employ this 8GB RAM to some extent is Superbook. Superbook is an interesting project by Sentio developing studio. Essentially, it can change the way we combine our devices for better use and more optimized performance. </p>
<p> Superbook is a small laptop shell that connects with your smartphone with cable. It completely uses phones software to run its system. The phone provides the brain while the laptop shell brings out the muscles to this dynamic duo. Since this is a quite affordable project, we will probably see a lot of alternative solutions from the third-party developers like Ubuntu, Lineage, or Remix. In addition, Motorola is still working on OneCompute Moto with similar characteristics. </p>
<p> At the end, the Android phones may need more power to fully utilize those novelty combo features. In that case, these RAM upgrade is a foreseeing of the producers. </p>
<p> CONS </p>
<p> And now, we are moving on to the dark side of this dispute. It always takes less effort to be negative about changes, but this may prove harder than it sounds. </p>
<p> Heavy hardware upgrade = poorly optimized software </p>
<p> We are all aware of the benefits for developers. They’ll have more freedom and can prioritize the performance over the RAM consumption. But, evidently, there are drawbacks that can and will impact the apps when the upgrade occurs. As the past has shown us on numerous occasions, the software optimization falls short where the hardware excels. This is just the case with vast of Android apps. The devs become careless, sloppy and tend to present unfinished products and patch them later. </p>
<p> For both device manufacturers and them, this seems like a win/win scenario. However, the customers are the ones that lose. Especially the ones that can’t afford to pay 700$ or even more for a smartphone. The best possible example is PC gaming. Namely, the modern games rely more on hardware than on developing structure. That way we get a game with more demanding requirements but the same or even lower quality than the 5-year-old titles. And that is just wrong. </p>
<p> That can be truly an issue with the smartphones, too. The availability of apps will be gradually reduced for the ones with budget phones. </p>
<p> But, everything runs smooth on 3 GB! </p>
<p> Eventually, we’ll have to ask ourselves is there the software appropriate for 8 GB of RAM? In a few years, probably. But at the moment 3 GB of RAM is quite sufficient for all the apps. Even for the most demanding, HD graphic intensive games. Then why to fix what isn’t broken? Instead of improvement, that can lead to a more bloatware and lack of optimization. </p>
<p> The battery, on the other hand, is something worth upgrading. We already talked about Li-Ion batteries as the underwhelming technology that needs to change. Why not address this issue rather than upgrading on already sufficient RAM memory? You won’t use your phone for complex demanding operations like some workstation PC. On the other hand, better battery life is an enormous upgrade to all handheld devices. </p>
<p> Additionally, with Nougat, Android introduced renewed ART (Android Runtime) feature called Just-In-Time (JIT). With this novelty smartphone boots faster, require less storage space, update faster and, eventually, optimize apps RAM consuming. So, one more reason to look at the 8 GB RAM like an overkill. </p>
<p> CONCLUSION </p>
<p> At the end, maybe the manufacturers know something we don’t and this is a reasonable move. Or they are just justifying the high prices by adding the cheapest hardware upgrades. Opinions are divided and the time will show who was right. We hope that we managed to vividly present both points of view on the subject. </p>

<p> How to add faces to Google Photos in Android </p>
<p> Organizing and backing up photos is an important task for all smartphone users. Google Photos are certainly the most obvious choice for the majority of Android photo enthusiasts. With lots of amazing features and multiplatform reach going for it. </p>
<p> The list of great features is long and includes hi-quality (16MP photos and 1080p videos) backups, automatic albums, AI assistance for improving and tweaking photos and videos, and of course, geo and people tags in photos. We’ll try to expand on the face recognition and explain how to tag people in Google Photos without making it a chore. </p>
<p> Step 1: Make sure you’ve enabled Face Grouping </p>
<p> Let’s start with the frequently-mentioned major drawback. In comparison to the discontinued Picasa, you can’t tag people in photos on your own accord. The machine learning algorithm recognizes and groups people before you can assign their names. Once it collects all photos of an individual face, you can apply tags. </p>
<p> Due to privacy laws, this feature is not available in most Europan countries. You can enable it with a VPN, by choosing a USA server. This is only a one-time procedure, and you can ditch the VPN later on. Once you’ve done it, make sure to enable Face Grouping and associated options in Google Photos settings. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do, step by step: </p>
<p> Download and run any free VPN service on your PC (like TunnelBear or similar clients). You can also use proxy browser extensions. </p>
<p> Run the VPN and connect to a USA client. It doesn’t matter where in the USA. </p>
<p> Open your PC browser and navigate to Google Photos for the web, here. </p>
<p> Sign with your Google account you use for Google Photos on your phone. </p>
<p> Click on the hamburger menu in the top left corner and open Settings. </p>
<p> Expand Face Grouping section and enable Face grouping. You can also add pets to People group as the engine can identify and distinguish pets, too. </p>
<p> Disable VPN and close it. It served its purpose. </p>
<p> Now, just wait for a prompt. </p>
<p> Step 2: Assign names to recognized faces </p>
<p> Once we dealt with that segment, the next thing you should do is wait. The machine learning algorithm needs some time to recognize and gather all faces. And the more photos you have, the longer you’ll need to wait. I had to wait 3-5 days for 1800 photos, but this isn’t a rule. </p>
<p> When the faces are finally grouped, you’ll be asked to tag them. Firstly, you’ll need to assign your account to your face. After that prompt, you can assign names to all recognized faces. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Open Google Photos either on your phone or PC. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Expand Face Grouping. </p>
<p> Choose yourself from the list of recognized faces. </p>
<p> Now, close Settings and open Albums. </p>
<p> Open People (or People & Pets) album and you should see all recognized faces. </p>
<p> Click on the individual person and assign a name to it. It can be a nickname or anything else which fits your liking. </p>
<p> After that, you can search for a person and all the photos of that person will appear. Which is, in our humble opinion, very nice. </p>
<p> Step 3: Google Photos can’t recognize faces </p>
<p> Finally, if you’re waiting and waiting and nothing happens, we see only 3 available options. The first one is to keep on waiting, the second requires you to disable and enable Face grouping again, and the third one, sadly, suggests removing and reuploading all photos in Google Photos app. </p>
<p> We’re aware that the third option isn’t the one preferable, but it seemingly worked for some affected users. You’ll need to use your PC to download all photos and re-upload them again with Face grouping enabled. Of course, depending on your bandwidth speed and the number and quality of photos, this can take a lot of time. </p>
<p> Even though we won’t recommend this, here’s how to do it if you decide it’s worth a try: </p>
<p> Toggle only Google Photos and click Next at the bottom. </p>
<p> Download the whole archive and save it on your PC. </p>
<p> Now, open Google Drive, here, and delete the Google Photos folder. </p>
<p> Open Google Photos in a browser or download the Backup & Sync client for Windows, here. </p>
<p> Upload all photos again. </p>
<p> Wait until the machine learning algorithm groups faces. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Don’t forget to share your thoughts about Google Photos or add an alternative way to solve the recognition issue. You can do so in the comments section below. </p>

<p> If you download all google photos with “Include all photo albums” checked it will result in duplicating pictures that dispide google photos duplicate algorithms it will get uploaded and you’ll end up with a lot duplicating photos. It’s quite bad honestly…. Downloading and uploading your photos will end up with losing all albums and custom data (like comments or changed date and time). What I would suggest is to use the “Partner” function. Create new account and add it as a partner in photos. Then in the new account select to save all photos automatically.

<p> Fix: Android 10 apps keep crashing </p>
<p> Every year the same story. Google introduces Android Beta for the next release in April or May, the final product goes out in September and the anguish of wait for so many users starts. However, we should know better than to rush major Android updates as these days they are more about aesthetics and, most importantly, first-adopters are riddled with bugs. </p>
<p> Issues that are quite debilitating for the user experience are many, but what’s worst than apps crashing left and right or even system and system services crashing. We made sure to add some solutions to this set of Android 10 problems below. Make sure to check them out. </p>
<p> Why does my Android phone keep crashing? </p>
<p> This is quite a rare happening but when it does happen, it’s usually due to incompatibility of the apps with the new Android version. </p>
<p> You should try and reboot your device, reset the affected apps or, eventually, reset your device to factory settings to resolve the problem almost certainly. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Reboot your device </p>
<p> The first thing to do is to reboot your device once. Switching from older to newer Android versions is usually seamless but sometimes the factory reset is recommended. But, resetting your device to factory settings and restoring everything can be quite a chore. </p>
<p> So, reboot your device and check for improvements. If the issue persists, move to additional steps below. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear cache from apps </p>
<p> If you can pinpoint apps that are crashing, maybe we are not looking at a system-wide problem. First of all, clear cache and data from all apps that are crashing after a system update was applied. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t help, reinstall said apps from the Play Store or sideload a newer version from the APK Mirror, from here. If pre-installed Google’s apps are causing issues, reset them to factory settings and check again. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to clear cache and data from apps on Android 10: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Tap All apps (App manager or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Open the app you want to clear cache and data from. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Clear cache first and then data. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Boot into Safe mode and check for improvements </p>
<p> Some OEMs recently removed the Recovery option to wipe cache partition but Safe mode is there to stay. It’s the essential troubleshooting step and it helps to identify the problem rather than solving it. In this case, it will help you find out whether the apps crashing on Android 10 issue can be singled out or it’s a system-wide issue. </p>
<p> Once you reboot your device in Safe mode, there are two scenarios. If the issue persists, we highly recommend moving to step 5 and resetting your device to factory settings. On the other hand, if everything works as intended, make sure to update your firmware. </p>
<p> Here’s how to enter Safe mode on Android: </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button until the Power menu appears. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Power Off icon until you see the Safe Mode prompt. </p>
<p> Tap again to restart your device into the Safe Mode. </p>
<p> To exit the Safe Mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Update the firmware </p>
<p> As mentioned in the previous step, update giveth and update taketh away so, the best way to resolve rushed Android 10 update is with timely patches. And, since we are looking at a major issue, OEM will probably provide the fix as soon as possible. </p>
<p> So, navigate to Settings and check for updates. Users are usually prompted when there’s an update available, but it won’t cost you to check out for updates manually. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to update your device: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System or About device. </p>
<p> Check for updates. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, the last solution we can recommend is the safest bet that apps or system won’t keep crashing on Android 10 anymore. And that’s the factory reset. This is usually advised as there are changes in the system architecture and certain apps and services might misbehave. </p>
<p> So, back up your data from the internal storage and system settings to Google Drive or OEM’s cloud and reset the device. </p>
<p> If you are not sure how to do it, follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Back up your data from the internal storage (photos can be saved to Google Photos, other media can be saved to an external storage or a PC). </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > System > Reset. </p>
<p> Select Factory data reset. </p>
<p> Follow instructions to reset your device to factory values. </p>

<p> Fix: Apps not updating on Android 10 </p>
<p> What’s worst than getting a major system update, expecting all kinds of improvements (both aesthetic and practical) just to see that it completely broke the most regular thing on Android — app updating and download from the Play Store. But, based on many reports, it seems that apps are not updating on Android 10 for some reason. </p>
<p> We made sure to check out possible causes and tackle the issue head-on. The solutions for the problem are below so make sure to give them a try. </p>
<p> Why are my apps not updating on Android? </p>
<p> This is a major problem but the fact that it doesn’t occur frequently points towards the update as the main cause. Upgrading to a newer OS version often brings problems. </p>
<p> Eventually, you might want to reset your device to factory settings. But, before that, to avoid that nuisance, try the steps below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear cache and data from the Play Store app </p>
<p> This seems to be a major issue that affects many users that recently got the update from Android 9 to Android 10. The first step is to reboot your device. Open the Google Play Store and try updating or downloading apps again. </p>
<p> In case the issue persists, make sure to clear the locally-stored data from the Google Play Store. The Play Store has cached data like any other Android app and the data might corrupt. Especially when the kernel and other variables change after an update. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to clear cache and data from the Google Play Store on Android 10: </p>
<p> Then open All apps or App Manager. </p>
<p> Locate the Google Play Store and open it. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check the connection </p>
<p> This goes without saying and, in most cases, users can confirm that the network is hardly a problem. However, you can check some in-app settings concerning the Play Store. In addition, make sure that the Play Store has all the necessary permissions. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to check the connection and inspect the Google Play settings and permissions: </p>
<p> Try downloading or updating apps with Mobile Data. </p>
<p> Disable VPN or proxy. </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > All apps > Google Play Store and select Permissions. Give all necessary permissions. </p>
<p> Open the Google Play Store > hamburger menu > Settings and set App download preference and Auto-update apps to Wi-Fi only. </p>
<p> If apps are still not updating on Android 10, make sure to continue the troubleshooting by moving to the next step. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Sign out and sign in with your Google Account </p>
<p> The next thing you should try is to sign out of your Google Account and sign in again. If there’s a bug even remotely related to your account, this procedure should address it completely. Once you sign out, reboot your device and sign in with your account again. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to sign in and sign out of your Google Account on Android 10: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select Accounts. </p>
<p> Choose Google. </p>
<p> Remove Google Account and restart your device. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings > Accounts and sign in with your Google Account. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Uninstall Google Play Store updates </p>
<p> If the previous step hasn’t solved the problem and apps are still not updating on Android 10, we recommend uninstalling updates from the Google Play Store. Since the Play Store is an essential part of the system, it can’t be completely uninstalled. </p>
<p> What you can do is uninstall the updates and wait for it to update itself again. That way, it should start working as intended so you’ll be able to install updates for pending apps and download new apps without any issues. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to uninstall Google Play Store updates: </p>
<p> Choose Apps and then Apps Manager or Manage apps. </p>
<p> Locate and open the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall updates. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Clear data on Google Play Services and other services </p>
<p> Besides addressing the Google Play Store, there are multiple associated services that need your attention and are possibly related to the issue at hand. The list includes Google Play Services, Google Services Framework, and Location Services. </p>
<p> What you need to do is navigate to each of these 3 in the Settings > Apps and clear cache and data. They are usually hidden by default so you need to enable System services in order for them to appear on the All apps list. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear data from Google Play Services, Google Services Framework, and Location Services on Android 10: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps and then Apps Manager or Manage apps. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and ensure that System apps are shown as well. </p>
<p> Locate and open Google Play Services, Google Services Framework, and Location Services respectively. </p>
<p> Choose Storage. </p>
<p> Clear Data and confirm when prompted. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Install Google Play Services APK </p>
<p> The aforementioned services can’t be reinstalled. However, you can uninstall updates from Google Play Services and, either wait for the service to update on its own or sideload an APK. This is something I personally did when migrating from Android 9 to Android 10 and it helped me address the problem. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Uninstall updates from the Google Play Services. </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror, here, or any other websites that offer apps for sideloading. </p>
<p> Now, you can either go for the latest version of Google Play services or you can download an older one. We suggest downloading an older version, not older than 2 months. </p>
<p> Download the APK and run it. Once asked for permission to install apps from untrusted sources, make sure to grant it. </p>
<p> Install Google Play services and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, the only thing remaining is to reset your device to factory settings. If apps are still not updating or you can’t download new ones to your Android 10-powered device, this is what remains to do. We know that the procedure is definitely cumbersome, but the safest way for everything to work when switching from old to new Android versions is to reset the device. </p>
<p> That way, all preinstalled services and system apps should work without any problems. Of course, there are some distinctive bugs certain OEMs brought with Android 10 but, in that case, there’s nothing you can do except report the issue and wait for the patch. </p>
<p> So, back up your data and follow these steps to reset your device to factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> That’s a wrap. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share alternative solutions or questions in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<p> Thanks for the comprehensive list! Tried everything, and nothing worked. Disabled my wifi and now they’re finally updating (we’ll see how much data that eats…). If that hadn’t worked, I’d be stuck with a factory reset. </p>
<p> Tried all of the above, cept factory reset. Works manually (except for Chrome and WebView, which occasionally updates). Not worth a reset. </p>

<p> Fix: Android 10 Dark Mode issues </p>
<p> Dark Mode is one of the most requested features on the Android platform. And, although many OEMs have had a variety of dark UI theming for some time, it got better with the introduction of Android 10. Now just app developers need to incorporate it into their apps. Either way, even with all that, some users say that they are experiencing Dark Mode issues on Android 10, no matter what they try. </p>
<p> If you are among users who can’t enable Dark Mode, make sure to check the steps we listed below. </p>
<p> Why is Dark Mode not working on Android 10? </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Make sure your system is up to date </p>
<p> One of the big breakthrough features introduced with Android 10 is the global dark mode, although many OEMs already have this feature on their Android 9 Pie skins. But, with Android 10, the global dark mode is not really an optional feature anymore but more a norm. Don’t mix it up with the Inverted colors option — it’s not the same. </p>
<p> So, updating to Android 10 should get you global dark mode that covers most of the system apps, UI (including Settings and Notification shade/Quick Access menu), and more. However, it seems that’s not really working for some users. That’s why we need you to check for system updates first and confirm that you are running an Android 10-based skin. </p>
<p> Once you can confirm that, navigate to Settings > Display and choose Global dark mode (or something along those lines) to force the Dark mode even on apps that don’t have it at the moment. Even if the dark mode is not available, this will trigger the string in the code and, voila, you got yourself the dark mode. </p>
<p> If this doesn’t work, make sure to continue with the steps below. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check developer options </p>
<p> Besides the usual global dark mode that’s easily accessible from Settings > Display > Dark mode, there’s also a similar option in Developer options. Now, if the Global Dark mode is not working as intended when enabled via the regular settings, make sure to check for the option in Developer options. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to check Dark mode in Developer options: </p>
<p> To enable Developer options, navigate to Settings > System or About Phone. </p>
<p> Tap on the Build number 7 times and insert PIN/Password when prompted. </p>
<p> Now, open Settings > System > Developer options. </p>
<p> Open Dark theme and select Dark. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and look for changes. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Check individual app settings </p>
<p> If you are having issues with certain apps not having Dark mode even after the global dark mode, you should check the in-app settings. Now, the majority of apps these days come with the dark mode but some require premium access to unlock the dark mode. </p>
<p> Others, like Facebook, can be forced to use the dark mode but, due to a lack of optimized UI, the UI segments will be all over the place. Nonetheless, open the app that’s bothering you and look for Dark Mode (Dark Theme) settings. And make sure that the theme is set to System default or Dark. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Update apps or get Beta APKs </p>
<p> Due to a dark mode frenzy, all major developers are certainly working on the dark mode for their respective apps. But, for some reason, some of them are rather slow with the integration so we can just wait. </p>
<p> What you can do is check online for the dark mode availability for a certain app and keep apps up to date. Additionally, Dark Theme for apps like WhatsApp is perpetually stuck in the Beta version. Now, since the official beta program for many apps is full, you can sideload the APK of the latest beta version and get the dark mode that way. </p>
<p> Google recently stated that there are dangers in sideloading apps but, as long as you stick to a not-tempered APKs, there’s no reason to worry. </p>
<p> What you need to do is just navigate to APK Mirror or different APK aggregating website and download the latest Beta APK. Uninstall the app you want to sideload from your device and install the APK. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share your dark mode issues with your specific device. That way, we might be able to provide some help or better insight. Post your comments in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/android-10-gesture-navigation-not-working" parent_folder="web1" id="file17841054" filename="android-10-gesture-navigation-not-working">
<p> Fix: Android 10 Gesture Navigation not working </p>
<p> Android 10 brought a lot of minor improvements and a few nifty features that some OEMs already had on previous iterations of Android. One of those is Gesture Navigation that allows you to hide 3 navigation buttons from the bottom. However, it seems that Android 10 gesture navigation is not working for some users. </p>
<p> How do I turn on gestures on Android 10? </p>
<p> Now, have in mind that some third-party launchers are not supported. So, if the problem occurs on the 3rd-party launcher, there are some steps below to help you out. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if gesture navigation is not working even on the stock launcher, we can recommend wiping the cache partition or resetting your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check settings </p>
<p> The first thing to do is to ensure that Navigation Gestures are enabled in System Settings. By default, most OEMs will stick to a 3-button navigation at the bottom. So, you’ll need to enable gestures before using them. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to enable Gestures Navigation on Android 10: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Select Gestures. </p>
<p> Choose Gesture Navigation and configure the sensitivity. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Moving on. If you have any third-party gesture apps installed, make sure to uninstall them. If the issues persist and gesture navigation is still not working, we recommend wiping the cache partition. The problem might lie in the transition from Android 9 to Android 10, which is why it is recommended to reset the device to factory settings after a major update. </p>
<p> If you are not sure how to wipe cache partition from the Recovery menu, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Use ADB command </p>
<p> For some reason, Google decided to limit the new Gesture Navigation to stock launchers. Which means that gestures won’t work with 3rd-party launchers. This is, supposedly, mitigated later for a few major launchers, like Nova and Action launcher. </p>
<p> Now, if Gesture Navigation is still not working for you, some users on XDA found a workaround. There seems to be an ADB command that enables Gesture Navigation even on third-party launchers. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to utilize the command in ADB and enable Gesture Navigation with 3rd-party launchers: </p>
<p> Enable Developer Options. Navigate to Settings > System or About phone > tap 7 times on the Build number and enter PIN/password when prompted. </p>
<p> In the Developer options menu, enable USB Debugging and all USB debugging-related features. </p>
<p> Download and extract SDK Platform Tools for Android on your PC, here. </p>
<p> Connect your smartphone to your PC and grant access to your PC when prompted. You should see that the USB Debugging mode is enabled in the Notification shade. </p>
<p> On your PC, open the extracted SDK Tools folder. Hold Shift and then right-click on an empty area within the folder. Select the “Open PowerShell window here” from the contextual menu. </p>
<p> Copy the line below, paste it in the PowerShell window, and press Enter: adb shell cmd overlay enable com.android.internal.systemui.navbar.gestural </p>
<p> Have in mind that this procedure needs to be applied after every reboot. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Update your device </p>
<p> Like every year, OEMs try to reduce the fragmentation and update their premium devices as soon as possible. Surprisingly, they tend to provide an OTA update for an unfinished and bug-riddled Android just for the sake of following forced timelines. And that has been an issue for some Samsung and Nokia users who got Android 10. </p>
<p> The “get the unfinished product, polish it later” approach is definitely something welcome for Beta testers, not end-users who want the stable OS on their daily drivers. Therefore, we suggest reporting the bug and keeping your device up to date. </p>
<p> On the other hand, make sure that your custom launcher is also up-to-date. Open Play Store > hamburger menu > My apps & games and ensure that the custom launcher is up to date. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Stick to the stock launcher or use a 3rd-party app </p>
<p> If Android 10 Gesture Navigation is still not working on your device, consider choosing between gestures and custom launchers. Whatever is your priority. You can use a 3rd-party app to simulate stock Gesture Navigation without problems. </p>
<p> You might need to use ADB again to grant it necessary permissions but, in return, you get more customization and features. </p>
<p> Now, if Gesture Navigation won’t work even on the Android 10 stock launcher, the only remaining thing we can recommend is the factory reset. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> As we already explained in the introduction, this article tackles two similar problems –Android 10 Gesture Navigation not working with custom launchers and Gesture Navigation not working at all. If you are bothered by the latter and previous steps haven’t addressed the issue, we recommend resetting the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to reset your Android 10-powered device to factory settings: </p>
<p> Back up your data from the internal storage (photos can be saved to Google Photos, other media can be saved to an external storage or a PC). </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > System > Reset. </p>
<p> Select Factory data reset. </p>
<p> Follow instructions to reset your device to factory values. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and make sure to tell us if the issue is resolved. The comments section is just below. </p>

<p> Android 10 issues on Pocophone F1 and how to solve them </p>
<p> The long wait is finally over, as Pocophone F1 users have started receiving the Android 10 update (MIUI 11). The new MIUI version brings all the goodies of Android 10 to your Poco F1, like the system-wide dark mode, revamped gestures, and more. </p>
<p> However, as it’s usually the case with most updates, MIUI 11 also causes problems for some users. Luckily, MIUI 11 isn’t as bugs-ridden as some other versions of Android, but users who were affected would certainly want to resolve the issues as soon as possible. Even if it’s just a minor problem. </p>
<p> Apparently, most issues in MIUI 11 for Poco F1 are related to connectivity, so if you’ve encountered a data or WiFi connection problem, stick around to learn more. </p>
<p> 1: Mobile Data problems </p>
<p> Mobile data appears to be the biggest issue for users on MIUI 11. People have been reporting the problem across various forums since the update arrived. Reportedly, there’s an internal issue inside the system that disrupts mobile data. </p>
<p> A few users have also suggested that the problem could be attributed to the phone’s hardware. Namely, the Poco F1’s signal antenna cable could be damaged, which would cause the data connection problem. </p>
<p> However, most users quickly dismissed this claim, because calls and messages appear to be working fine. On top of that, if hardware were indeed the problem, the issue would’ve aroused before MIUI 11. But if you’ve encountered data or signal issues in the past, you should take your phone to the repair service, anyway. </p>
<p> Right now, the exact cause, as well as the solution to this problem are still unknown. A few users managed to restore the data connection after flashing another ROM, but there are no other workarounds. So, re-flashing your system appears to be the only thing you can do. </p>
<p> It’s also worth mentioning that most of the reported problems appear on MIUI 11 EU, so flashing another version of MIUI, like Global, or installing a custom ROM could help. If you don’t want to deal with all the bloatware in the Global version, you can easily debloat the whole OS with this tool. </p>
<p> If you’re not comfortable messing with your system on that level, you can only hope for a fixing update. But since we have no official word on this matter yet, we’re not sure if the patch will ever arrive. </p>
<p> 2. WiFi issues </p>
<p> Unfortunately, data isn’t the only connectivity problem on MIUI 11 for Pocophone F1. Although reported by fewer users, the WiFi connection seems to be the issue, as well. Here are a few things you can try if facing the Wifi Problem on your Poco F1: </p>
<p> Enable Airplane mode and disable it after a minute. </p>
<p> Reset APN. </p>
<p> Reboot your phone and router. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 3. USB connection not working </p>
<p> One user reported that he’s unable to connect his Poco F1 to the PC upon installing MIUI 11. Although such problems could be hardware-related, the user who reported it specifically stated that his hardware is in check, and that the USB connection issue only occurs in MIUI 11. </p>
<p> Furthermore, standard workarounds like re-installing the USB driver on a PC don’t seem to work in this case. So, if it’s not a hardware problem, and the software workaround is still unknown, you can only wait for the patch. </p>
<p> Interestingly enough, the USB connection seems to work on Ubuntu. That means there’s probably an internal issue inside MIUI 11 that causes a conflict. Nevertheless, will have to wait for Xiaomi to further investigate the issue. </p>
<p> 5. Important troubleshooting steps for MIUI 11 </p>
<p> It won’t hurt if I also list a few general workarounds that could help with any other problem you encounter. None of this may help, but most won’t hurt. </p>
<p> Enable access to Developer options </p>
<p> Open Settings and then My device. </p>
<p> Select All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number. </p>
<p> Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options. </p>
<p> Scroll down and open “Reset WLAN, mobile networks, and Bluetooth“. </p>
<p> Tap Reset settings. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings </p>
<p> This one might actually hurt, so perform the factory reset only as a last resort and if you know what you’re doing. And don’t forget to backup all your data! </p>
<p> Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> That’s about it. As you can see, Android 10 (MIUI 11) on the Pocophone F1 isn’t as problem-ridden as it could be, but even a single problem could be enough to annoy users who expect a smooth experience from the new OS version. </p>

<p> How to fix Android 10 Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Android 10 officially came out in September 2019 with no groundbreaking improvements and a bit different aesthetic approach. Now, we all know about Android fragmentation and the fact that some OEMs still haven’t updated numerous supported devices. But, one possible reason for that is polishing. And some Android 10 users reported various Wi-Fi issues. </p>
<p> If you have any Wi-Fi issues on Android 10, make sure to check the steps we provided below and, hopefully, resolve the problem. </p>
<p> Can’t connect to WiFi after Android 10 update </p>
<p> If you can’t connect to Wi-Fi after updating to Android 10, make sure to reboot your phone and router. Alternatively, you can switch to 2.4GHz Wi-Fi frequency and update your router’s firmware. </p>
<p> Check these and other troubleshooting steps below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Forget the network and connect again </p>
<p> The first step to try in order to fix connectivity issues on Android 10 is to forget the network and try reconnecting again. Additionally, restart your phone and router. Some kind of IP conflict might be the cause of the problem and, by following the aforementioned steps, you should be able to address the problem most of the time. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to forget and reconnect to your wireless network: </p>
<p> Open Wi-Fi or Network Settings > Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Select the troubled SSID and tap Forget Network. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check your router/modem (disable WPA + WPA2) </p>
<p> Most reports point out that every other device connects without issues except their smartphone. This is, most of the time, caused by the device itself. However, for the sake of troubleshooting, we can also suggest inspecting your router settings. </p>
<p> Google how to enter your router settings and ensure that your smartphone MAC address is not blocked. Additionally, some users suggest disabling WPA + WPA2 security and sticking to just WPA. Alternatively, you can disable passwords completely for your SSID just to check it out. </p>
<p> Finally, you can also reset your router to factory settings and look for improvements. If your smartphone still won’t connect to Wi-Fi after these steps, continue to the next step. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Disable Bluetooth temporarily </p>
<p> This might sound weird but if it works, it works. Some users managed to connect to wireless as usual, without any issues, by simply disabling Bluetooth. It seems that there’s a bug on certain models (Pixel devices among others) that appeared after the Android 10 update. </p>
<p> And, weirdly enough, disabling Bluetooth while on Wi-Fi worked like magic. In case NFC is available, we recommend disabling it, too. Give it a try and look for a resolution. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check Network settings </p>
<p> The next step is to thoroughly inspect Network settings on your device. Make sure that to use randomized MAC and DHCP. Additionally, disable proxy if there’s any. </p>
<p> You can find the aforementioned settings by navigating to Settings > Wi-Fi or Settings > Network Settings > Wi-Fi. If you had to change some of the settings, reboot your device and try reconnecting. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reset Network settings to default values </p>
<p> One of the steps that’s frequently recommended is to reset your network settings to factory values. This will remove saved SSIDs and paired devices (via Bluetooth) but it should address the problem at hand. </p>
<p> If you are unsure how to reset Network settings on Android, follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Choose System or General management. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Then select Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Stick to 2.4GHz frequency for the time being </p>
<p> Another important thing to consider is that some affected users were not able to address the problem until they switched their router to 2.4GHz frequency instead of the 5GHz one. It seems that, after the Android 10 update, the 5GHz frequency Wi-Fi stopped working. </p>
<p> So, navigate to your router settings again and enable the 2.4GHz mode instead of the 5GHz one. At least for the time being. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Update the firmware on router and phone </p>
<p> As we already stated, this is in most cases the problem with the device. The problem caused by the major Android update which is Android 10. Thanks to a community, it seems that Google patched the problem that occurred on Pixel devices. </p>
<p> In addition, it might be that the router is not up to date so we recommend updating its firmware as well. Check your router settings and update the firmware to ensure that the latest firmware version is installed. </p>
<p> Solution 8 – Reset your device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps helped you address the problem at hand, you can try and reset your device to factory settings and start from scratch. We are aware that this might be a time-consuming procedure and you’ll lose all of your data from the internal storage in the process. </p>
<p> Sadly, it’s the last thing we can recommend. If you are not sure how to reset your device to factory settings, make sure to follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Back up your data from the internal storage (photos can be saved to Google Photos, other media can be saved to an external storage or a PC). </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > System > Reset. </p>
<p> Select Factory data reset. </p>
<p> Follow instructions to reset your device to factory values. </p>
<p> And, with that, we can conclude this article about Android 10 Wi-Fi issues. Thank you for reading and make sure to share any alternative solutions we forgot. The comments section is just below. </p>

<p> Fix: YouTube links not working on Android 10 </p>
<p> Opening external web links with an app has a lot of benefits. On Android 10, users will be prompted to choose the default app for certain links. So, it’s obvious to open YouTube links on the YouTube app for so many users. However, some of them reported that YouTube links are not working on Android 10. Learn how to resolve this problem below. </p>
<p> YouTube app not opening links on Android 10 </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear cache and data </p>
<p> Let’s start by clearing the cache and data from the YouTube app. There’s a chance that the locally-stored data is corrupted, causing the problem with links. This will also clean the default association with YouTube links so, the next time you try to open the YouTube link, the system will prompt you to select the default app. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from the YouTube app: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > All apps. </p>
<p> Open YouTube. It should be at the bottom of the app list. </p>
<p> Select Storage. </p>
<p> Clear cache and then data. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check in-app settings </p>
<p> Another thing worth checking is related to opening web links within the app. Namely, many apps will use the WebView to open links within the app instead of switching to an actual default browser or YouTube. </p>
<p> So, make sure to open the app, choose Settings, and ensure that links are opened externally. That way, when you tap on a YouTube web link, it should open in the YouTube app. </p>
<p> Some apps that use WebView integration are official Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. Open Settings in those respective apps and ensure that links are not opened internally but rather in the associated apps you have installed on your device. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reinstall YouTube </p>
<p> The next step we can recommend is to reinstall the app. If the issues with YouTube links continue, reinstallation should help you address them. Coming from Android 9 to Android 10, issues like this might occur. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to reinstall YouTube on your Android device: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > All apps. </p>
<p> Open YouTube. It should be at the bottom of the app list. </p>
<p> Uninstall the app or, if YouTube is a system app, uninstall its updates. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and install YouTube from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reset app preferences </p>
<p> You can also try and reset app preferences in system settings. This is a long-shot solution but chances are that opening of YouTube links is granted to another 3rd-party app which might be the cause of the problem. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset app preferences on Android: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> After that, reboot your device and try opening YouTube links again. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Update your firmware or perform a factory reset </p>
<p> Finally, if YouTube links are still not working on Android 10, make sure to update the firmware and keep the app up-to-date as well. If that doesn’t help and you are still experiencing issues, consider resetting your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share questions or alternative solutions in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<p> Tip: Speed up your Android phone by tuning Animation Scale </p>
<p> Chances are you’re using a phone that’s at least a year old. And if current industry trends are to be believed, you’ll probably stick with it for another year before upgrading. Now, depending on where your phone was on the specs scale initially, its present performance is either (still) a smooth ride or an obstacle course. </p>
<p> If you didn’t want to spend a lot of money in the first place and bought a budget device a year or two ago, you’re probably experiencing certain lags and slowdowns in your daily usage. So, I’m going to show you a useful trick that will make your phone a little bit faster and more responsive. At least, it will feel like it. </p>
<p> One of the oldest tricks in the book when trying to enhance the performance of your smartphone is tuning the animation scale. Keep reading, and you’ll find out what the animation scale is, how to play with it, and what benefits does it bring. </p>
<p> What is the animation scale in Android? </p>
<p> There are three types of animation scales in your system: The Window animation scale, Transition animation scale and Animator duration scale. All three of these scales control the animations that appear when you scroll through a page, open a window or transition between different screens. You can guess from the names which option is for what. </p>
<p> Animations take up resources. So, the bigger the value, the more work on your CPU. Obviously, if you want crisp, fast and responsive animations, you’re going to beef up the animation scale. The visual experience will be better, but it will come with “a cost”. You’ll be sacrificing the performance. </p>
<p> Since we’re looking to speed up your phone, you’ll probably want to downscale the animations or even disable them completely. Sure, scrolling and transitioning between screens will feel dull, but it will also appear to be faster. </p>
<p> How to disable (change) the animation scale in Android </p>
<p> To even access the animation settings, you need to have Developer Options enabled. If you already do, skip this step; if not, here’s how to enable Developer options in Android: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll down and tap About phone. </p>
<p> Find the Build number section. </p>
<p> Start tapping the Build number section continuously until you get a pop-up message saying that you’re a Developer now. </p>
<p> After this, the Developer Options section will appear in the Settings. </p>
<p> Now, that everything’s set. You’re ready to play with animations. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Head over to Developer Options. </p>
<p> Scroll down until you find Window Animation Scale, Transition Animation Scale, and Animator Duration Scale. </p>
<p> Here, you can play with all three options, and see which one brings the best results for you. Each animation scale can go from Off to 10x. </p>
<p> There you go, if you choose to scale down the animations to, for example, 0.5x or disable them completely, your phone should feel faster, but the transition between screens or scrolling will be flat. </p>
<p> Do animations drain the battery? </p>
<p> Okay, you now know that smoother animations put some extra pressure on the CPU. But does disabling animations also extend the battery life? Technically, yes. If you scale down the animations, your CPU will have one less operation to perform, and therefore will use less power. </p>
<p> However, when looking at the big picture, handling animations is an insignificant task, compared to other processes your CPU has to handle. So, even if disabling animation reduces battery usage, you probably won’t even notice any difference. If your battery drains fast, it’s not because of animations. Instead, try some other workarounds that should have a bigger effect on your battery. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope this trick worked for you, and that your phone now at least feels faster and more responsive. If you still don’t see a difference in performance, you should probably go back and enable animations. Because it’s better to have a slow phone with smooth animations, than a slow phone with no animations. </p>

<p> Well I found out today that the 3 transition windows do have something to do with the size and structure of the screen when you are looking at it for 2 weeks my Google Chrome Homepage was to wide someone changed the transition windows from .5 to 1 after putting the windows back on .5 the chrome homepage was back to normal thanks for the information you guys left for me to use and find the problem..thank you.. </p>
<p> I don’t think it will hurt the CPU but something will happen..be careful </p>

<p> 0.5x on all with “off” for “window animation scale” does it for me. As it that turned off makes the keyboard show up instantly… The other two let them on 0.5x or just 1x as they are if your phone is mid range. </p>

<p> Fix: Android Auto crashes, connection issues, and other problems </p>
<p> If you don’t already drive a smart car, a handy car companion made by Google called Android Auto will make your car a little bit smarter. It’s very convenient, as it replaces some more expansive parts of your cabin like GPS navigator and radio by combining them into a single package. </p>
<p> So, why would anyone buy expensive equipment when Android Auto provides everything? Well, maybe because Android Auto is still just an app. And apps tend to be less reliable than gear made specifically for the purpose. </p>
<p> Now, I don’t say Android Auto is unreliable. In fact, it’s a very well-made piece of software that will definitely be your friend on the road. It’s just that issues will occasionally happen, and you don’t want to be out on the road, with your navigation system broken. </p>
<p> That’s why I compiled a list of the most common Android Auto issues (and their solutions), so you’ll know what to do when they occur and continue to drive safely. Just remember to pull over when using your phone, I don’t have to tell you why. </p>
<p> 1: Android Auto isn’t working </p>
<p> In case Android Auto doesn’t even work when you try to connect it to your car, keep the following things in check first: </p>
<p> Check if your car is compatible. You need more than just a USB cable for Android Auto to work, as your car needs to support Android Auto in the first place. Here’s the list of all supported manufacturers and cars. </p>
<p> Check if Android Auto is turned on in your car’s infotainment system. </p>
<p> Make sure you added your car to Android Auto by going to hamburger menu > Settings > Connected cars. </p>
<p> 2: Android Auto crashes </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear the app cache </p>
<p> The first thing you’ll want to do is clearing Android Auto’s app cache. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Apps or Apps Manager (depending on your phone). </p>
<p> Find Android Auto. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Tap Clear cache. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Update the app </p>
<p> Google’s constantly improving its services. Which means that besides new features and enhancements, it also resolves the known problems. So, if Android Auto is crashing, there’s a chance Google will address this problem in an update. </p>
<p> Just make sure to check for Android Auto updates in the Play Store regularly. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Limit background processes </p>
<p> As crashing is a common Android Auto problem, a few users managed to uncover that it’s related to battery optimization and background processes. That’s why they suggest you disable battery optimization and limit background processes before using Android Auto. </p>
<p> We’ll start with limiting background processes. But we need Developer Options for that. If you don’t have Developer Options enabled already, here’s how to enable this feature: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to About phone. </p>
<p> Tap Build number continuously until you get a pop-up message saying that you’re a Developer now. </p>
<p> After this, the Developer Options section will appear in the Settings. </p>
<p> Now that we’re sure Developer Options are there, let’s limit these background processes. Here’s how: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Go to System > Advanced > Developer options. </p>
<p> Scroll down to the Apps section, and tap Background process limit. </p>
<p> Select At most 2 processes. </p>
<p> Keep in mind this will limit the number of processes running in the background, which could slightly slow opening apps down. If you notice an unbearable difference, you might want to bring background process limit to Standard limit when you’re not using Android Auto. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Disable battery optimization </p>
<p> If limiting background processes isn’t enough, make sure you disable battery optimization for Google Play Services. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Tap Apps & notifications. </p>
<p> Go to Advanced > Special app access. </p>
<p> Go to Battery optimization. </p>
<p> Make sure both Android Auto and Google Play Services are set to Don’t optimize. </p>
<p> 3: “Something went wrong Google Play Services doesn’t seem to be working at the moment” </p>
<p> At the time of writing this article, Google says it’s still investigating this issue. Which means we still may be far away from the actual solution. But when it arrives, you’ll probably receive it as an update to Android Auto. Just keep checking for new updates regularly. </p>
<p> In the meantime, one user reported on Reddit that he managed to resolve the problem by uninstalling Android Auto, disabling Google Play, and then clearing the cache of both Google Play and Google Play Services. So, you can try the same thing, and see if it works for you. </p>
<p> Here’s the step-by-step solution: </p>
<p> Uninstall Android Auto. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Apps & notifications. Tap the three-dots menu, and choose Show system apps. Find Google Play, and tap it. Tap Disable. </p>
<p> Stay in the Google Play section. Tap Storage > Clear cache. </p>
<p> Go back to Apps, find Google Play Services and tap it. Go to Storage > Clear cache. </p>
<p> Go back to Google Play Store, and Enable it. </p>
<p> Head over to the Store and install Android Auto again. </p>
<p> 4: Google Maps stops showing </p>
<p> Once again, this issue is on Google’s “under investigation” list. So, the same logic applies as to the problem above. However, a few users managed to find their way around missing Google Maps in Android Auto. </p>
<p> Samsung’s power saving mode restricts various apps and features, including Android Auto’s integration with Google Maps. So, if Google Maps stops showing in Android Auto, and you’re using a Samsung phone, try changing the power saving mode to Medium by going to Settings > Device care > Power mode > Medium power saving mode. </p>
<p> Another case where Google Maps won’t show is if Android Auto isn’t permitted to use the Location service. Here’s how to check it out: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Apps > Android Auto. </p>
<p> Tap Permissions. </p>
<p> Make sure Location is toggled on. </p>
<p> 5: Can’t make a call or send a message </p>
<p> If you’re unable to make calls or send messages through Android Auto, Google once again advises you to update the Android Auto app. However, here are a few more things you can try: </p>
<p> Clear Android Auto cache </p>
<p> Reinstall Android Auto </p>
<p> Clear Google Play Services cache </p>
<p> Re-connect Android Auto to your car </p>
<p> 6: Android Auto won’t stop ringing </p>
<p> Speaking of calls and messages, there’s another related problem. And that’s when Android Auto just won’t stop ringing. But unlike the previous issues, there’s a known workaround for this problem. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Uninstall Android Auto. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Connections > Bluetooth > Advanced > Menu (three dots in the right corner) > find Ring Tone Sync and turn it off. </p>
<p> Install Android Auto </p>
<p> Leave car off for 5 minutes. </p>
<p> Go to Radio > Home screen > Settings > System > Phones > select the little pen/pencil icon > Forget the device. </p>
<p> Turn the car off and leave it for a few minutes. </p>
<p> Reconnect your phone. </p>
<p> 7: Location appears wrong </p>
<p> In case Android Auto shows a wrong location, there could be something wrong with the GPS and Location services. Of course, the first thing you should do is make sure both Google Maps and Google Play Services are up to date. But there are a few additional workarounds you can try to resolve this issue: </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Increase GPS accuracy </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Location. </p>
<p> Go to Mode, and enable High Accuracy. </p>
<p> In case you can’t find this option, go to Security & location > Location > Advanced > Google Location Accuracy, and make sure it’s toggled on. </p>
<p> In the app, open the menu, and tap Manage A-GPS state. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> When the process is finished, go back to Manage A-GPS state > Download. Your GPS will now refresh. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Disable Mock locations </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to System > Advanced > Developer options. </p>
<p> Scroll down to the Debugging section. </p>
<p> Tap Mock location app, and select Nothing. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I certainly hope you managed to resolve your problem with these solutions. If you’ve encountered an issue I didn’t list in this article, feel free to write it down in the comments below. </p>

<p> Android Auto/Google Assistant keeps stating that “she”, “doesn’t know how to help with that”, or that, “I don’t understand” every time I ask for her to open something. She will however, open said app. It will not always appear on my Chevy Spark’s display. Also, at times her voice gets very shrill. I intend to try all of the suggestions you mentioned. Any idea about my issues? Yes, I referred to AA/GA as female. </p>

<p> Fix: Android 11 Chat Bubbles not working </p>
<p> Most of the Android 11 improvements are under-the-hood, but notifications rearrangement and Chat Bubbles are definitely going to be fan favorites. Chat Bubbles allow for overlaying FB Messenger-like movable chat bubbles for messaging apps. This is a system-wide feature and all that is left is for developers to enable it in their third-party apps. Nonetheless, some user reports state that Android 11 Chat Bubbles are not working for them. </p>
<p> If you are among them, make sure to check for possible solutions below. We hope the steps we listed for you will help you address this problem in no time. </p>
<p> How to use Chat Bubbles on Android 11? </p>
<p> 1. Make sure that the Bubbles are enabled </p>
<p> First of all, not all messaging apps support chat bubbles at the time being. At the moment, besides Facebook Messenger and Google Messages, only Telegram functionally supports Chat Bubbles. WhatsApp should support them as well, however, it doesn’t work for some reason. </p>
<p> The next thing you should do is ensure that Bubbles are enabled in System Settings. Here’s how to enable Bubbles: </p>
<p> Choose Apps & notifications. </p>
<p> Select Notifications. </p>
<p> Choose Bubbles. </p>
<p> 2. Enable Chat Bubbles for a particular app </p>
<p> The next thing to do is to ensure that the Chat Bubbles feature is enabled for the particular app that supports the feature. Supported apps probably won’t have it enabled by default, so it’s worth checking out Settings. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to enable Chat Bubbles by apps: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps & notifications. </p>
<p> Tap All apps. </p>
<p> Look for the app that won’t work with the Bubbles. </p>
<p> Open the app from the list and select Notifications. </p>
<p> Tap Bubbles. </p>
<p> Choose All conversations can bubble. </p>
<p> 3. Clear app’s cache and data </p>
<p> If Chat Bubbles are still not working for you, despite you went through the first two steps, we encourage you to clear the app’s cache and data. Chances are local data is corrupted after the upgrade to Android 11, so it’s recommended to give this step a try. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from the affected app: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps & notifications > All apps. </p>
<p> Locate the app that keeps giving you problems with Chat Bubbles. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data and log in again into the app if necessary. </p>
<p> 4. Update the app </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps proved to work for you, make sure to update the app. Alternatively, you can enroll in the Beta program to get the feature working as soon as possible (e.g. WhatsApp) or get the latest APK of a Beta version from the APKMirror. </p>
<p> Just navigate to Play Store and, from there, look for the app that refuses to work with Chat Bubbles on Android 11. Make sure that it’s up to date and scroll down to enroll in the Beta program. Once fully updated, test it out to see whether Chat Bubbles work or not. </p>
<p> And, on that note, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share your thoughts with us in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/android-notifications-not-showing" parent_folder="web1" id="file17842431" filename="android-notifications-not-showing">
<p> Fix: Android notifications not showing </p>
<p> In recent years, Android OS development had an obvious focus on notifications with the goal to reduce clutter and improve the overall experience. However, all those nifty tweaks are not as important if you are not getting notifications at all. Some users reported that notifications are not showing on their Android devices at all. </p>
<p> If that’s the case for you, make sure to follow the steps below and fix the problem for good. </p>
<p> Why am I not getting notifications on my Android? </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check system notification settings </p>
<p> Let’s start by ensuring that all system notification settings are properly configured. This is usually what causes the problem, as apps have notifications enabled by default. So, the problem with not getting notifications is more times than not, somewhere within system settings. </p>
<p> Here are some things you need to check out and ensure that system notification settings are properly configured: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps (or Notifications) and then Notifications. </p>
<p> Enable all notifications. </p>
<p> Now, get back to Settings and open Sounds. </p>
<p> Ensure that the notification sound is set. </p>
<p> For some OEMs, navigate to Settings > Display > Notch & status bar. Once there, toggle on the “Show the icons for incoming notifications” option. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check in-app notification settings </p>
<p> Once you are completely certain that the issue isn’t with the system settings, make sure to check the in-app setting for each individual app. One option might be off and you won’t be able to get push notifications through. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to learn where and what options you should check in individual apps: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select Apps (then open All apps, App manager, or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Select an app from the list and open it. </p>
<p> Tap Notifications. </p>
<p> Move through all the sections and enable them. </p>
<p> Then open the app that’s bothering you and locate Settings. </p>
<p> Check whatever is related to notifications and ensure that all incoming notifications are enabled. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear cache and data from the affected apps </p>
<p> Moving on. In case notifications are still not showing on your Android, make sure to clear the cache and data from apps and give them permissions again. Chances are that the piled-up data caused this problem. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from an Android app: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > All apps (App manager or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Select an app from the app list. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> Clear cache and then clear data. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Disable battery optimization for affected apps </p>
<p> Some OEMs with their custom Android skins tend to go a bit overboard with the battery optimization. Besides the usual battery optimization that will reduce app activity in the, they come with certain managers that prevent apps from auto-starting or working in the background. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to disable battery optimization for apps that don’t show notifications: </p>
<p> Navigate again to Settings > Apps and open an app. </p>
<p> Choose Battery optimization. </p>
<p> Disable optimization for the app that’s not providing you with notifications. </p>
<p> If available, turn on the Auto-start option. </p>
<p> Additionally, if your device’s Android skin (Xiaomi MIUI, Huawei EMUI, Samsung One UI) has a manager that aggressively kills apps in the background, make sure to whitelist apps in order to get notifications. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reinstall apps </p>
<p> The next thing you can do is reinstall the app. You can start from scratch and, at the same time, get the latest version of the app. Just navigate to the Play Store, look for the app, and uninstall it. Download the app again, clear cache and data, and then check notification settings again. </p>
<p> Additionally, you probably want to leave the Beta program for the affected apps and stick to the public release. </p>
<p> In some cases, the latest version of the app is flawed and, until the developer addresses the issue, you can use an APK to downgrade the app. Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Uninstall the app that’s missing notifications. </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror, here, and look for the app that’s missing notifications on Android. </p>
<p> Download an older APK (not too old, 2-3 months old version at most). </p>
<p> Allow installation of apps from third-party sources. </p>
<p> Install the app, sign in if necessary, and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Make sure that the Do not disturb mode is off </p>
<p> Additionally, and this should go without saying, but make sure that the Do not disturb mode is off. If the DND mode is enabled, depending on your configuration, you won’t be getting any notification. </p>
<p> You can disable the Do Not Disturb mode in the Quick settings or within the System Settings. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> We already mentioned the importance of clearing cache and data from the affected apps. However, you can also wipe cache partition to tackle the system-wide issues with the locally-stored cache. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to wipe cache partition on your device: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the Android welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Solution 8 – Update the firmware </p>
<p> Another important thing is keeping your firmware up to date. Make sure to install available system updates and monthly patches in order to resolve possible bugs. This is the only way to fully address major system bugs. </p>
<p> Here’s how to update your firmware to the latest system version: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose About phone or System. </p>
<p> Open System updates. </p>
<p> Check for updates and install them. </p>
<p> Solution 9 – Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps worked out for you, you can always reset the device to factory settings. That way, you’ll get a clean slate. This procedure won’t downgrade your current Android version but will, in change, delete everything from the internal storage. So make sure to back up everything before resetting the device. </p>
<p> That should do it. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to post your questions or alternative solutions in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>
<p> 1 COMMENT </p>
<p> Iv’e tried all of the above as well as a factory reset with no prevail. My old phone was a ZTE Z970 that I used until the battery started swelling up. Nevertheless I had no problems with this device running 4.4.4 kit Kat. Now I have this Alcatel 3v running Android 9 p, & I cannot get one simple daily notification from a play store app. I get my emails from text messages and phone calls everything else works great. if I set the notification maybe 5 10 to 15 minutes into the future I can get the notification…..sometimes.

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/android-o-developer-preview-4-bugs-round-up" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844566" filename="android-o-developer-preview-4-bugs-round-up">
<p> Android O Developer Preview 4: Known Issues and Bugs Round-Up </p>
<p> The due date is closer day by day. Google announced the 8th Android version for the 3rd quarter of 2017. It brings so many changes and improvements to a world’s most popular platform. While we eagerly expect Android O (that mysterious O’s meaning is still unclear, though) users that pack Google-powered handsets can obtain Developer Preview. Most certainly the final preview version goes by the number 4. If everything goes as intended, August or early September are reserved for the full version. </p>
<p> We already wrote about the first preview a while ago and advised you not to install it on your every day, primary device. It was unstable and could cause crashes and the malfunction of certain system features. However, that’s not the case with the Developers Preview 4. If it’s to believe to reports, it works great and it’s a viable option. Still, we would rather wait for the final version. </p>
<p> Even though Devs Preview 4 is a much better-optimized showcase of Android O, it’s far from flawless. For that purpose, we prepared a list of reported issues and bugs, so you can know what to expect from the final Preview. If you’re keen to give it a try, make sure to first check the list below. </p>
<p> Known issues of Android O Developer Preview 4 </p>
<p> Battery drainage </p>
<p> Battery drainage was the problem from the start. It declined in the second release and erupted in the third Developer Preview. Many users reported much better battery longevity on Developer Preview 4 but it’s still not perfect. These are what users on Reddit’s dedicated thread said about that: </p>
<p> ”Anyone else still experiencing battery drain issues? I’m still seeing it, just not as bad as DP3.” </p>
<p> ”Agreed. Android O is suppose to be optimized and efficient for battery life, yet it has this problem” </p>
<p> ”Some apps still drain battery insanely quickly. I just opened snapchat and it went from 43% to 37% in about a minute. The camera does this as well so is it something anyone else is experiencing with the camera?” </p>
<p> ”Battery drains faster than when my device was on DP2 and DP3. 100% got drained in 3hrs or less. Didn’t have this issue in previous previews. Stats show 53% due to Google play services. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling play services. Didn’t help. Pixel XL” </p>
<p> As you can see, this still needs to be fixed by Google before the final release. The fact that the battery draining percentage is reduced, it still isn’t optimized and efficient enough when it comes to expected battery life. </p>
<p> Notification issue </p>
<p> Notifications are also the problem for some users. Some of them are experiencing a constant repetition of the same notification in the background while others are unable to see notifications whatsoever. These are some comments they posted on the dedicated Reddit’s thread: </p>
<p> ”Notification dots doesn’t work on my N5X.” </p>
<p> ”Anyone else getting a persistent Gmail running in background notification. Started this morning for me.” </p>
<p> ”Still getting those notifications which can’t be disabled.” </p>
<p> As you can concur on your own, there is still a need for a final touch. It seems that in the final version, users will be able to disable those but the option is still unavailable. </p>
<p> Android Pay NFC issue </p>
<p> With the introduction of Android O, users will be able to utilize a nifty Android Pay over NFC protocol. However, it seems that for some users this still isn’t functioning in a flawless manner. One user reported that Android Pay failed him after he upgraded to Developer Preview 4 but it fixed on its own later. This is what he said about it on Reddit: </p>
<p> ”NFC pay is broken on mine. </p>
<p> EDIT: it returned to normal, odd.” </p>
<p> Have in mind that this is an isolated case and that the Android Pay is mostly performing well. At least, for this phase of the OS development. </p>
<p> Missing options </p>
<p> Some users that already obtained Developer Preview 4, reported more than few missing options that, originally, should be there. Some of those are missing due to tests and changes for Android O interface, while the lack of others signifies an obvious bug. One way or another, we hope that Google will listen to a people’s voice and sort things out before the final version emerges. </p>
<p> ”Option “Turn on Wi-Fi automatically” is still not back. I can find it if I search for it in the settings, but if I tap on it in the search results it redirects me to the correct page but it’s not there.” </p>
<p> ”This is weird. I had the change theme option show up under display > advanced options and I had the option to change it to one of my OMS themes (I couldn’t get substratum working yet but I had installed). I changed it and my settings menu changed to that theme. However, the notification pulldown turned white on white. Went to change it back and the option is gone. Welp.” </p>
<p> This isn’t unusual for the beta version, so it shouldn’t be a deal breaker. Moreover, these are, as we already stated, isolated cases and for the majority of users, every presented option is available to use. </p>
<p> Crashes </p>
<p> In this phase of the system development, we can’t expect a perfect behavior. Hell, even the general system updates are not always stable and can be clunky or prone to crashes. In this version, the majority of crashes come from unoptimized 3rd-party apps. But, occasionally, even the pre-installed software can be the culprit. These are some reports developers posted on Reddit’s Bug Tracking thread: </p>
<p> ”360° videos in Facebook app makes the app crash.” </p>
<p> ”HBO Go VR for Daydream doesn’t work properly. I can’t sign in. The app crashes at the sign in phase.” </p>
<p> ”Contributing photos in google maps make the app crash.” </p>
<p> Luckily, once the final version is introduced to a general population, apps developers should be able to optimize and re-design their respective apps. That should reduce crashes and provide us with much more satisfying overall experience. </p>
<p> Google Play Store issue </p>
<p> One it comes to Android essentials, like Google Play Store, we shouldn’t expect issues. But, one user reported a problem that emerged after he switched to Developers Preview 4, and it concerns Play Store. This is how he elaborated his problem on Reddit: </p>
<p> ”Google Play Store shows as Uncertified again” </p>
<p> As you can see, it seems that the OS can’t recognize Play Store as an official feature. Reboot resolved the problem, but we hope that the final version won’t have misconceptions like this. </p>
<p> Pink Text on YouTube app </p>
<p> This is already a common bug that was present on the previous iterations of the Android O Beta. Namely, it looks like the color of the text in the YouTube Search bar is garishly pink and it’s an unpleasant change from the standard black-colored fonts that are normally used. Now, this is what certain users said on Reddit: </p>
<p> ”Anyone getting pink text for search history in YouTube? I don’t like it!” </p>
<p> ”Yes, still pink for me in DP4.” </p>
<p> Luckily, this seems to be a bug that should be removed from the final product. Or at least, users should be able to customize their preferred font color. </p>
<p> Camera issue </p>
<p> One camera issue that was confusing users on Nougat is, allegedly, still present. Namely, users on Reddit reported that, once they access the previously recorded video or photo through the camera app, they see older entries instead of the last one. This is what they stated: </p>
<p> ”Nexus 6P user here. There’s a bug in the camera app where if I go to view a video I just took, it shows the previous photo/video instead. Is this a common issue across devices? </p>
<p> Edit: I updated to DP4 a few hours ago” </p>
<p> ”Just updated my 6P to DP4 a few hours ago. I’m getting a bug in the camera app where if I go to view a video, it shows the previous photo/video instead.” </p>
<p> Seemingly, this bug should be addressed before the final release. </p>
<p> Video playback issue </p>
<p> Videos streaming issues from the 3rd-party apps also found their spot on our round-up list. This is what a few users experienced after the update to Developer Preview 4. They posted their comments on the Reddit thread: </p>
<p> ”On the Facebook app, maybe other apps, videos look pixelated because video resizing is not filtered. This was not happening in DP3. not a showstopper but quite noticeable.” </p>
<p> ”Instagram videos not playing on Pixel XL.” </p>
<p> Multiple Redditors, including the original posters, concluded that the problem is related to 3rd-party apps that are still unoptimized. We can hope that the problems will resolve after the final version is introduced. </p>
<p> Volume issue </p>
<p> Even the sound is affected. Some users reported too low volume while talking on the phone. Others had trouble with customizing the media volume since some features were missing. Without further ado, we brought to you what they said on Reddit’s dedicated Bug thread: </p>
<p> ”When I make a call the volume sounds really low even though I have it at its highest setting. Anyone else experiencing this?? </p>
<p> So I reset my pixel XL thinking it might go away, pixel wouldn’t read my verizon sim. Couldn’t get any voice or data to work. Had to opt out of the DP and go back to nougat. Everything is fine now.” </p>
<p> ”If I’m watching YouTube and I want to adjust the volume, it changes the call volume. I have to hit the down arrow and then adjust the media volume.” </p>
<p> ”Using the volume buttons changes my “Call” noise level and not “Media.” I have to collapse the sound menu to adjust the volume. Also it is extremely low.” </p>
<p> Obviously, we’re looking at bug of some kind that, in our opinion, isn’t a major drawback. They’ll certainly resolve it before the official presentation of Android O. </p>
<p> Car Bluetooth issue </p>
<p> Many Android enthusiasts that were keen to give a try to the Developers Preview 4, have had issues with Bluetooth. Especially while using it for wireless connection with the car’s media board. These are their posts brought to you in wholly from Reddit: </p>
<p> ”Fast forward over Bluetooth does not work anymore with car controls (mazda 3).” </p>
<p> ”Since the last DP I’m not displaying audio info on my 2013 Mazda 3. But controls work fine.” </p>
<p> ”Bluetooth is still very inconsistent in the car. Google Play Music starts a song and plays about three seconds and then starts the song over. Haven’t gotten it to play a full song yet. Pocketcasts will play for about four seconds and then pause, and then pickup playback for 3-4 seconds and then pause again. I can get it to smooth out and play normally if I toggle the play/pause buttons on both the phone and car until it syncs up. This is with a 6P and Dodge Charger with uConnect. </p>
<p> Yeah, I tried again on my lunch break to see if it would sync up better. It was actually worse this time. Also couldn’t get any calls to connect through bluetooth. So this one’s going back in the drawer until the final release!” </p>
<p> Picture in Picture issue </p>
<p> With Android O, Google is introducing ”Picture-in-Picture” mode that is, arguably, one of the best (or even the best) multitasking features ever presented in Android. It functions well in Preview 4, but it’s still unpolished and for the final version, we expect it to work great. Some users have had issues with the Picture-in-Picture mode, and this is what they said on Reddit: </p>
<p> ”If I have a YouTube picture in picture video playing, turn the screen off, then turn it back on, it does a soft reboot.” </p>
<p> ”Nexus 6p : I can’t get pic in pic to work, i have youtube open and playing video when i click on the home it closes the app” </p>
<p> That should be that. If you have additional issues or complaints, or possible solutions for some of the reported problems, make sure to give us a shout in the comments section below. All of us are eagerly waiting for the Android O and all included advancements that should improve the overall experience. </p>

<p> Android O Developer Preview: Known Issues and Bugs Round-Up </p>
<p> Even though a lot of Android users are still waiting for an update to Nougat 7.0, Google announced brand new OS. Android Oreo or Oreos is the 8th Android installment and should be available for consumers in August or September 2017. </p>
<p> For the time being, Google released Developers Preview version that should showcase upcoming features. It’s available only for Google-powered devices, namely for: </p>
<p> Pixel </p>
<p> Nexus Player </p>
<p> So if you have one of these models, you can try out Android O. However, have in mind that this is not a stable version and you can encounter a large variety of issues. For that purpose, we listed some of the known issues for this preview release, so you can know what to expect. </p>
<p> Known issues of Android O Developer Preview </p>
<p> System User Interface Issues </p>
<p> With Android O, Google conducted various changes and improvements with UI. Sadly, you may have a hard time experiencing those when we consider these reported issues: </p>
<p> ”System UI crash after toggling screen brightness, then going to Overview (recent) and selecting a new app. </p>
<p> Occasional issues navigating Home, with incomplete transition making the device unusable. </p>
<p> Taps in Quick Settings may be registered in another location. </p>
<p> When using Autofill, an “Android system app displaying on top” message is sometimes shown, but it can be ignored (if it’s turned off, it will disable Autofill).” </p>
<p> Google Cloud Messaging/Firebase Cloud Messaging </p>
<p> Cloud Messaging is also unstable in this preview version. These are the problems that occurred with some users: </p>
<p> ”FCM doesn’t work in a secondary profile unless the app is also installed on the primary profile. If the app is not installed on the primary profile, an FCM token is not generated in the secondary profile. </p>
<p> Developers using FCM/GCM with Android O should update their Google Play services SDK to version 10.2.1, which is available from the SDK manager in Android Studio.” </p>
<p> Android TV Issues </p>
<p> The Nexus Player has specific issues on its own. We are bringing you whole detailed list below. </p>
<p> ”Setting up a restricted profile then restarting the device causes the device to be unusable. </p>
<p> Typing in the search bar causes a crash. </p>
<p> PIP image does not fill the window. </p>
<p> Launching applications via voice command does not work. </p>
<p> Application size is not displayed in Application Settings. </p>
<p> Microphone button on remote control does not work. </p>
<p> Factory reset does not work on Fugu. </p>
<p> Connected remote control device disconnects intermittently. </p>
<p> USB connected drive cannot be formatted. The Setup as device storage formatting option does not work properly for drive attached via USB. </p>
<p> Device may freeze with blank homescreen when plug is inserted. </p>
<p> Location status in Settings may become disabled with user unable to re-enable. </p>
<p> Not able to reorder games in the apps and games row. </p>
<p> Content may not play after relaunching media apps.” </p>
<p> Android for Work and Device Manager Issues </p>
<p> Android for Work is a great feature that let you create and manage work-specific profile separately from the private one. At the moment, there is a single reported issue regarding Android for Work. </p>
<p> ”Enabling a Work Profile may cause a crash in Settings app. To work around this issue, remove and re-add the Work Profile.” </p>
<p> Besides that, users reported occasional crashes while trying to access the Device Manager. </p>
<p> ”Selecting the Settings > Security and Screen Lock > Android Device Manager menu item may cause a crash. Updating to the latest version of Google Play services will resolve this issue.” </p>
<p> Android Wear Issues </p>
<p> Besides handsets and Android TV, Android Wear has also support trough Android Emulator System Images. However, it’s not without issues. </p>
<p> ”Embedded app installation from Play Store can sometimes crash. Side-loading can be used to work around this issue. </p>
<p> Only the x86 emulator is currently supported. </p>
<p> Default watch face complications may not load until you switch watch faces or otherwise touch watch face settings, or reboot the device.” </p>
<p> Wi-Fi Issues </p>
<p> With Android O, Wi-Fi will receive additional interesting features. Additionally, there is one distinguished error and it’s concerning special services calls. </p>
<p> ”611 call can’t be made on a Wi-Fi profile.” </p>
<p> Performance and Battery Issues </p>
<p> As you would expect, this is release is not advisable for everyday use. It is quite buggy and unstable performance-wise. </p>
<p> ”System and app performance is known to be periodically slow / janky, and device may become occasionally unresponsive. These problems may become more acute with prolonged use. </p>
<p> Some apps may not function normally on Developer Preview 1. This includes Google’s apps as well as other apps. </p>
<p> This release has various stability and performance issues on all devices that make it not suitable for daily use on phone or tablet, especially for non-developers.” </p>
<p> Moreover, the same goes for battery. If you are willing to try out Android O Developer Preview, prepare for battery drainage. </p>
<p> ”Battery life may be regressed in this early release for screen-on and screen-off use cases.” </p>
<p> And with the lack of percentage that is removed from UI, you won’t be able to determine consumption as easily as before. </p>
<p> Other Issues </p>
<p> Besides best-known issues, you may face a variety of secondary issues related to lack of optimization. Don’t forget that some of the apps/features you may use are still not compatible with novelties that Android O brings to the table. </p>
<p> ”Using the Google Drive app’s PDF viewer to load a PDF document may cause the device to freeze. </p>
<p> Apps or games may hit ANRs in GLThread, such as with , that cause crash or failure to load properly. </p>
<p> Games using Google Play games services may have problems with sign-in. </p>
<p> The latest release of Android Auto may not work properly on Developer Preview 1. </p>
<p> The NDK cannot build targeting Android O DP1 (an upcoming r15 release will fix).” </p>
<p> Have in mind that these are only the ‘noticed’ issues since we are too early in this release phase. So, a large variety of unlisted issues can occur. Additionally, features like Android Pay are not available due to security reasons. </p>
<p> At the end, unless you’re a developer or knowledgeable enthusiast, we don’t advise you to install Developers Preview. Soon enough we should be able to download Beta version with CTS (Compatibility Test Suite) approval. That should be much safer to work with. </p>
<p> What are your first thoughts on Android O? What are the changes you eagerly await? </p>

<p> Using Pixel XL, and since Android O the Google App itself is incredibly unstable. Most notably and specifically, the Assistant freezes the Google app upon a command (such as “call xyz”, or “send text to xyz”. The Google App freezes, then force close. </p>

<p> Home News Android Oreo issues on Google Pixel: Battery drain, random reboots, and more </p>
<p> Android Oreo issues on Google Pixel: Battery drain, random reboots, and more </p>
<p> Android Oreo has been around for quite some time on Google’s phones. Nexus and Pixel owners already have the privilege of trying the latest Android version. But is it really a privilege? </p>
<p> Namely, as it appears the Oreo update is far more troublesome than anyone initially expected. We already reported that Android Oreo (among other problems) drastically slowed down the Nexus 5X. But according to the latest reports, things are even worse on Google Pixel and Pixel XL devices. </p>
<p> Forums all around the internet are simply flooded with various bug reports and complaints from Pixel users. I gathered some of the most common issues, so here’s what to expect if you haven’t installed the Oreo update on your Pixel device, yet. </p>
<p> Google Pixel and Pixel XL issues with Android Oreo </p>
<p> Random reboots </p>
<p> The first issue I stumbled up is the problem with random reboots. According to one user on the forums, his Pixel just reboots for no apparent reason. Here’s exactly what he said: </p>
<p> “I’ll start by saying my original 6p was replaced because it got stuck in the bootloop like so many others who got the 6p. I had it replaced a few months ago with a refurbished unit through Google and ever since I updated to Oreo, I am getting random reboots again while using the phone. </p>
<p> I’m curious if anyone else is experiencing this. If not, I’ll assume it’s not software related and I have yet another defective 6p which will definitely be disappointing” </p>
<p> Disrupted battery life </p>
<p> Battery drain appears to be the most widespread problem across all devices running Oreo. Here’s what one user said on the forums about the battery drain issue: </p>
<p> “My battery life on Nougat was very solid, on every full charge I get 6-7 hours of SOT. Now, I’m getting less than half of that (about 3 hours). Is it just me or are u guys having the problem? Yeah, and this is the first time my pixel have continuous lags, it’s annoying” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, there’s still no confirmed solution for this issue. The only thing users with disrupted battery life can do is wait for Google to release a fixing update. </p>
<p> Can’t make phone calls </p>
<p> The problem with making phone calls appears to be another widespread problem in Android Oreo on Pixel devices. Here’s what one user said about it: </p>
<p> “I can’t make or receive phone calls after Oreo update. If I make a call, a prompt voice announce that I can’t complete the call right now to try later. Same prompt when somebody call me, that the y can’t complete the call right now, to try later. Anybody with the same issue/s?” </p>
<p> Apparently, Google’s Phone app doesn’t work properly in Android Oreo. But, a few users reported that resetting the app solved the problem. So, if you’re encountering this problem, simply go and delete the Phone app’s cache and data. If you don’t know how to do that, follow instructions from this article. </p>
<p> Ok Google problems </p>
<p> A couple of users also reported they’re unable to use the Ok Google command and Google Assistant upon installing Android Oreo: </p>
<p> “My Ok Google command does not work when screen is locked like it did before Oreo update. Anyone else have this issue?” </p>
<p> “My OK Google has been hit and miss since day one. I have retrained voice several dozen times. It always seems to fail when I am showing off the feature to someone.” </p>
<p> We’ve already talked about this issue last week. So, if you’re experiencing problems with Google Assistant upon installing Android O on your Pixel device, check out this article for solutions. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> And finally, another serious issue is the problem with Bluetooth pairing. Apparently, many users have issues with pairing their devices with peripherals via Bluetooth. Here’s what one of them said on the Google forums: </p>
<p> “I have been having Bluetooth issues with my Pixel for some time. I have been wishing that the recent update to Oreo would help but it’s made it worse. Bluetooth with my car audio stutters now, which didn’t happen before. Bluetooth with my Bose QC35 still stutters after 5 seconds of playing a song and continue. Any suggested workarounds?” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, there’s no solution for this problem, and users will probably have to wait for a proper patch. I can suggest you trying some solutions from this article, but can’t guarantee any of these will work. </p>
<p> That’s about it. As you can see, Android Oreo is still far from perfect. We hope Google will soon come up with new updates, because some of these issues are rather serious. </p>
<p> Have you encountered any issue upon installing Oreo on your device that we didn’t cover here? Let us know in the comments below, or reach me out on Twitter. </p>

<p> Camera not working after upgrading to Android Pie? Here’s what to do! </p>
<p> Android Pie brings useful under the hood improvements to various aspects of your phone. Including the new Multi-Camera API, which makes phones like the Nokia 9 PureView possible. </p>
<p> But there’s always the flip side of the coin. While improving camera abilities in general, Android Pie also caused camera-related issues in individual cases, as many users reported that their camera app simply stopped working after upgrading to Android 9 Pie. </p>
<p> If you’re one of the affected users, and assume you are, check some of the following solutions to bring your camera back to life and start using Android Pie to its full potential. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Update your phone </p>
<p> I’m almost positive updating your phone is the only ‘solution’ you’ll need when dealing with the camera issue. There’s a known bug inside the original version of Android 9 Pie that causes the camera to stop working. </p>
<p> Google has already addressed this issue. So, the only reason you still can’t use the camera is that you haven’t installed the patch yet. You already know what to do, just head over to settings and update your phone to the latest version of Android Pie. </p>
<p> As I said, the new update should resolve all the problems, so the chances you’ll need additional workarounds are slim. Nevertheless, if the issue persists, try some of the solutions listed below. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Update the camera app </p>
<p> The same principle applies to the camera app itself. There’s a chance the current version of your camera app isn’t fully compatible with Android Pie. If you suspect that might be the case, head over to the Play Store, find your camera app, and update it. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear the camera app cache and data </p>
<p> If you’ve read any article on this site before, you probably know I dislike listing clearing the cache and data as a viable solution. But it helps sometimes, so I have to include it. Regardless of what you think of this ‘solution’, it won’t hurt to clear the camera app cache and data (if necessary). Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Apps or Apps Manager (depending on your phone). If you can’t find it, simply search for installed apps in the Settings search bar. </p>
<p> Locate your camera app in the Apps Manager (if you can’t find it, choose Show all apps or Show system services from additional settings). </p>
<p> Tap Camera and choose Clear cache. If clearing the cache doesn’t resolve the syncing problem, repeat the procedure, but this time choose Clear data. Keep in mind that you’ll lose all settings if you clear the app data. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check the permissions </p>
<p> If you’ve been following the recent news on Android, you probably know the major permissions adjustment comes with Android Q. However, it’s possible that Android Pie actually messed up your current permissions settings. If that’s the case, your camera app can’t access the camera hardware. </p>
<p> So, we will ensure all the necessary permissions have been granted to the camera app. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Search the settings app for the Permissions settings. </p>
<p> Tap Camera permissions. </p>
<p> Make sure the camera app is toggled on. </p>
<p> Bonus – Use a third-party camera app temporarily </p>
<p> And finally, if none of the solutions above resolved the problem, you can temporarily use a third-party camera app, until you resolve the issue. That is, until the right patch arrives through Update. According to reports, the bug mainly affects stock camera apps, so you should be good with any third-party alternative. </p>
<p> Sure, third-party camera apps rarely deliver the same level of quality as most stock camera apps, but you have to work with what you have. On the other hand, using a third-party camera app or port can actually improve the image quality, like it’s the case with the Pocophone F1. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope you resolved the camera problem in Android Pie after following these solutions. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, write them down in the comments below. </p>

<p> Android 9 Pie issues on the Galaxy Note 9: Battery drain, Bluetooth problems, and more </p>
<p> The wait is finally over! Android 9 Pie has started rolling out to users on every major carrier network, as well as to the unlocked devices. And while some users are looking forward to the new features and the improved version of OneUI, others are experiencing issues with the new update. </p>
<p> On paper, the new update should improve the overall performance, as well as the appearance of the system. In fact, that’s how it should be with updates in general, not just Android Pie and not just on the Note 9. However, that’s not the case with every Note 9 user. </p>
<p> In this article, we’re going to explore all the reported problems that come with Android 9 Pie, so you can know what to expect. </p>
<p> Update not available </p>
<p> Even though the Pie update has been available for some time now, numerous users say they haven’t received it yet. Now, there are numerous reasons why you can’t receive the update. And it’s usually the little details, like not having enough storage space or battery. All of these issues are easily solvable, so you don’t need to worry about not getting the update. </p>
<p> On top of that, AT&T support says that users on this network need to obtain the update through AT&T services, instead of the regular way. As that’s the case with some other carriers, as well, you just need to use your carrier’s services, and the problem should be resolved. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> The Bluetooth connectivity seems to be the biggest Android Pie problem on the Galaxy Note 9, as most users reported various issues so far. The range of issues goes from failing to connect the phone to a car to being unable to connect it to other external devices (smart watches, Bluetooth speakers, etc.) </p>
<p> Right now, there’s no universal solution for any of the Bluetooth issues. Support suggests some banal solutions like rebooting the phone or resetting the network settings, but I doubt any of that would help. So, you can probably only wait for a patch that will hopefully address the Bluetooth issues. </p>
<p> Lags and stutters </p>
<p> One user also reported that upon installing the Pie update, his phone started lagging and stuttering. In fact, even the simplest and least resource-demanding operations, like pressing the back button or waking up the phone seem to stutter. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, not enough users followed up, so we don’t have the exact solution right now. </p>
<p> Empty bar under the keyboard </p>
<p> And now something that’s actually a new feature, but a lot of users interpret it as a problem. Namely, Samsung introduced an ’empty bar’ under the default keyboard to make typing more comfortable. So, when the empty bar appears, keep in mind that it’s intentional. </p>
<p> Now, it all comes down to personal preference. If you’re okay with the empty space, and it indeed makes typing more comfortable, just carry on with it. If it annoys you, install a third-party app like Swfitkey or Gboard, and the empty space will disappear. </p>
<p> There’s also a mod that will remove the empty space, so you can install it if you really can’t stand the bar. The mod only works with the gestures navigation and will remove the navigation bar if you have it on. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> Along with the Bluetooth issues, the battery drain is also the most commonly reported Android 9 Pie problem on the Galaxy Note 9. Numerous users complain about a huge decrease in battery life, that goes up to 50%. </p>
<p> However, nobody seems to know what exactly is going on. Therefore, the exact solution for the battery drain problem is still unknown. Of course, you can try some general solutions for the battery drain that are not related to Android Pie, but I’m not sure if any of them will be helpful. </p>
<p> Compass not working </p>
<p> Another problem that seems caused by Android 9 Pie is the compass not working. Numerous users have been reporting this issue on the XDA forums. According to Samsung support, it’s a firmware issue, and they cannot do anything about it right now. </p>
<p> We certainly hope the development team will figure out what’s wrong, and eventually release a patch. </p>
<p> That’s about it. This is the original set of reported issues with Android 9 Pie on the Galaxy Note 9. However, I’m sure there are even more problems that I didn’t put in this article. So, if you’ve encountered an issue that’s missing from this article, feel free to report it in the comments down below. </p>

<p> Fix: Apple Music doesn’t play songs in iOS 12 </p>
<p> Even though Spotify takes the majority of the music-streaming market, Apple Music is still holding up. There are some minutiae changes which came out recently with iOS 12, but the app (and the service in whole) is still simple to use and has a large music library. However, some users had issues with streaming tracks on Apple Music after the iOS 12 update hit the grid. </p>
<p> We offer a few solutions which should help you address this. You can check them in the list we provided below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check the connection </p>
<p> Every streaming service requires a stable connection in order to play selected tracks. Unless, of course, you don’t download songs to your local storage. So, before we move to additional steps, we need you to confirm your device is maintaining stable connection and the network isn’t the problem. </p>
<p> If the connection is indeed the problem, we suggest following these steps to resolve it: </p>
<p> Reset your router and handset. </p>
<p> Temporarily disconnect all other devices on the same network. </p>
<p> Try connecting to an alternative network. </p>
<p> Make sure SSID isn’t hidden. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Restart the device </p>
<p> Rebooting the device is always helpful. This seems to be a cache problem, as some users suggested on the official forum. The majority of cache-related bugs are easily resolved with a simple reboot. </p>
<p> After you restart your device, Apple Music should work as intended. On the other hand, if you’re still stuck with the “Not playing” prompt, move onwards through the list. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reset Network settings </p>
<p> All your Network related settings are stored and some of them might affect various connection-dependent apps. Especially after a major update, when is advised to clean all settings in order to prevent issues. </p>
<p> However, before we move to clean reinstall, we recommend resetting Network settings first. Have in mind that this will erase all saved ISSDs and passwords and Bluetooth pairings. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset Network settings on iPhone/iPad: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open General. </p>
<p> Select Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Install iOS 12 clean </p>
<p> Finally, as we mentioned in the previous solution, the best way to avoid issues after a major update is to install it cleanly. You can restore your files and settings later on. However, the only way to get Apple Music playing again is to avoid restoring. Now, we know that’s more than unwanted scenario, but that’s what, seemingly, completely addresses the error. </p>
<p> Here’s how to install iOS 12 on a clean-slate device: </p>
<p> Open General. </p>
<p> Select Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase All Content and Settings. </p>
<p> After the device resets, restore everything from iCloud. </p>
<p> That should do it. In case you’re still stuck with the error, we suggest avoiding restoring. Thanks for reading and we hope these solutions helped you resolve the Apple Music error. Don’t forget to share alternative solutions or questions in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: Apple Music won’t load in iOS </p>
<p> Apple Music is the number one choice of many when it comes to streaming music on iOS. But just like any other app, it has its own set of issues. </p>
<p> The particular problem we’re talking about here is when Apple Music actually opens, but it fails to load your libraries, playlists or just any music. If you’ve recently encountered this issue, and I assume you did, check some of the following solutions, and I hope you’ll be able to resolve the problem. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Enable iCloud Music Library </p>
<p> iCloud Music Library allows you to access all the music from your iCloud account through Apple Music. In short, you won’t be able to use Apple Music properly without this feature enabled. </p>
<p> Enabling iCloud Music Library is easy. You just need to go to Settings > Music, and make sure the iCloud Music Library option is enabled. </p>
<p> Enabling this option should re-establish the connection between Apple Music and your iCloud account, so you should have no problems streaming music anymore. However, if enabling iCloud Music Library doesn’t get the job done, try some of the solutions listed below. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Update iOS & iTunes </p>
<p> As Apple Music is Apple’s own service, Apple delivers frequent updates for it. So, it’s possible you’re dealing with a known issue that will likely be resolved in the upcoming update. </p>
<p> To make sure you receive that update, you should keep both your device and iTunes up to date. </p>
<p> First, go to settings and check if a new update for your iOS version is available. If it is, download and install the update, and the issue may be resolved. </p>
<p> If updating your iOS device didn’t get the job done, check for iTunes updates. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Check Apple Music servers </p>
<p> Although it’s unlikely, I have to mention possible server outage. If Apple servers are down, you won’t be able to stream any music with Apple Music. However, don’t worry because potential outages don’t usually last for too long. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reset network settings </p>
<p> In case updating your device and enabling iCloud Music Library didn’t resolve the problem, you can try with resetting the network settings. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Choose Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Reconnect with known Wi-Fi source and try commanding Siri again. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reinstall the app </p>
<p> I’d normally advise you to clear Apple Music cache, but unfortunately, that’s not so easy in iOS. Instead, you can try and reinstall the app, so the cache data will be deleted for sure. </p>
<p> After deleting Apple Music, head to the App Store and download it again. Hopefully, you won’t have any problems with loading your music library anymore. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope at least one of these solutions helped you to resolve the problem with loading Apple Music. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, just let us know in the comments below. </p>

<p> Everything you need to know about app permissions on Android </p>
<p> The ever-growing platform such as Android will certainly always be at the center of the radicalized views regarding the privacy and end-user security. In a system, as great as Google’s Android is, with more than 2 billion users, around 10 million active developers and hundreds of hardware manufacturers, we need a strict set of rules when it comes to what an app can or can’t do on one’s handset. </p>
<p> A casual Android user rarely pays a greater attention to app permissions. They mostly install the app and just move through the installation procedure as fast as possible and accept everything in the random predicament of confirmation tapping. </p>
<p> But, app permissions are important. They’re there from the start, a tad stricter now than they were back in the days, but very significant — now more than ever. </p>
<p> ”Why?”, you might you ask. Well, there are various reasons and we made sure to provide you with the in-depth explanation of app permissions and why you should take a better look next time a pop-up appears on your favorite gadget’s screen. </p>
<p> What are Apps Permissions on Android? </p>
<p> App permissions are, simply put, system boundaries applied to all apps executable on an Android-powered device. Every app functions in the limited-access sandbox and every sensor and peripheral function has the dedicated permission concerning capabilities and information sharing. </p>
<p> Some apps will install immediately and ask you for every permission individually later on; others will show you all permissions before you install them but you’ll need to enable them manually, nonetheless. It all depends on the developer’s choice and the gravity of the access they ask for. </p>
<p> Only the later way was at disposal in the pre-Marshmallow Android era but without the runtime permission-granting included. And it’s safe to say that wasn’t reliable at all, as it provided a fruitful ground for various malversations of malevolent developers. </p>
<p> Google decided that enough is enough and made the permissions stricter. Namely, with the introduction of Android 6.0 a.k.a Marshmallow, the things changed for the better and stayed that way until this day. </p>
<p> What’s the price of granting the full access to an app? </p>
<p> Firstly, the Play Store has a privacy and safety standards which are fairly imposed on all developers. However, there are more than a few reports about data leaks, location-tracking fiascos, and all-around inconsistency in the security barriers of the Android software ecosystem. </p>
<p> So, it’s wise to act with caution with every new app you download and install. Some folks might say these are lowkey ”tinfoil hat” assumptions, but a lot of apps will track your location and take sensitive data for various purposes. </p>
<p> Some will sell your private data to the highest bidder for the advertising purposes, others, the less harmful ones, are focused on stealing your credentials. The antivirus solutions are, basically, a non-consistent way to protect from these threats. You first and the last line of protection are App Permissions, so don’t grant them until you double-check why the app at hand requires them. </p>
<p> The focus is on 5 main permissions most of the time: </p>
<p> Location – a malicious app will track your location. Even if you don’t want it to do it without a dire need. </p>
<p> Phone – a malicious app can make calls directly, without your consent. Usually, you need to press the Dialer button, but there are ways to override that, allegedly. Also, it can, in the worst case scenario, gain access to your credentials. </p>
<p> SMS – the same as above, just with SMS and MMS messages. </p>
<p> Contacts – an app can read and make changes to your Contacts. You have an idea why this can lead to a privacy infringement. </p>
<p> Storage – an app can access your storage (both internal and SD). </p>
<p> Now, to be perfectly honest, most of the apps will neither steal your data or money. Google makes sure the vast majority of apps is in-depth code checked before it can find its place in the Play Store. </p>
<p> However, we tend to advocate the ”better safe than sorry” approach, so make sure to double-check the App permissions, especially with the unfamiliar apps. </p>
<p> How to inspect and disable App Permissions for all installed apps? </p>
<p> This is rather simple and the approach is the same with all but scarce Android UIs which deviate from the norm. Just open Settings > Permissions. There you can open each section and disable everything you find suspicious. </p>
<p> Also, you can open Apps (Applications or Application Manager) in Settings and check what permissions are granted to all respective apps. </p>
<p> After a thorough look up, you should be able to find and disable all unwanted permissions. Also, you can reset the App data and thus remove all permissions you previously granted it. </p>
<p> With that, we can wrap it up. We certainly hope that this was an insightful read and that we shed at least some light on this fairly important but rather neglected Android’s security module. </p>
<p> Feel free to share your thoughts on the subject in the comments below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<p> Fix: Apps don’t work after installing iOS 10.2 update </p>
<p> Apple costumers around the world got a new update that become available two days ago. iOS 10.2 brought one new interesting feature (TV app), few aesthetic upgrades and plenty of bug fixes. But, as always is the case after a new update, some problems have shown. We are sure that this is just a way of the things work and that every problem finds it’s solution. So, no need to worry. </p>
<p> Issues that are mostly reported throughout Apple community are related to update/install errors and faulty or crashing apps. </p>
<p> User from Discussion Forum reported a problem with Camera after updating to iOS 10.2. </p>
<p> ”I have an iPhone 6. I updated to iOS10 when it came out and had no problems. I applied the iOS 10.2 update – for a minute there I thought it had bricked my phone, but was able to get it working – and now have the strangest camera problem: </p>
<p> If I open the camera app, the screen is black and it won’t let me take a picture (tried normal, square). I tried both forward and rear facing cameras, neither works.If I try using a 3rd party like Instagram, the app crashes. </p>
<p> What works:Panoramic WORKS. </p>
<p> Video or slo-mo option front and rear cameras work </p>
<p> If I open iMessage and use the photo icon from there it lets me take a picture (front or back camera). </p>
<p> What I have tried: </p>
<p> 1) Kill and restart the Camera app. </p>
<p> 2) Hard restart (Hold down home and power button for long time) </p>
<p> 3) Restart, then open the camera app from the lock screen. (tried various ways – with and without the flash on) </p>
<p> 4) Toggle camera setting in restrictions. (also disable restrictions) </p>
<p> 5) reset to factory settings (Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset All Settings) </p>
<p> Any other suggestions? I’m ready to just wipe and restore at this point.” </p>
<p> Few good members of the community presented us with the answer, so we will elaborate it here. </p>
<p> How to fix faulty apps after iOS 10.2 update </p>
<p> After the update, some apps appear to work bad or suddenly froze. Presented solutions from the most members didn’t seem to work out because mentioned user tried it all. Nevertheless, he got it solved. </p>
<p> Solving faulty Camera app by restoring your device via iTunes </p>
<p> To restore your phone via iTunes, do the following. </p>
<p> Connect your device to a PC with installed latest version of iTunes. </p>
<p> Find your device and select it. </p>
<p> Click Summary and backup your settings. </p>
<p> Choose Restore Phone. This will reinstall the latest firmware to your device. </p>
<p> When restoration is over, launch the last backup to get back your settings. </p>
<p> We hope this will help you to solve this issue. If you have something to add, we will be pleased to see it in the comment section. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/apps-wont-move-to-an-external-storage" parent_folder="web1" id="file17843534" filename="apps-wont-move-to-an-external-storage">
<p> Fix: Unable to move apps to SD card </p>
<p> A few years ago, a 8 GB in the sense of internal memory was a huge number. SD cards were almost mandatory and maximum range went up to 32 GB of extra external storage memory. Nowadays, we have flagships that don’t support external storage or, their counterparts, that support cards that go up to 256 GB. Either way, things are simple: you need more storage space – you either buy a handset with enormous internal memory or extend the memory reach with the SD card. </p>
<p> The things got complicated when Google stopped once-favored practice to transfer or install apps directly to SD card. You can still store media files, but apps are just out of the way. Nonetheless, if you have an older device (pre-Marshmellow age) you should be able to store apps on your SD, too. Except when the things suddenly take a wrong turn. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we prepared a list of possible solutions for the problem with detailed explanations. If you have had a hard time transferring apps on your SD card, follow the instructions below. </p>
<p> Make sure that the app and the device supports transfer to SD </p>
<p> After the introduction of Android Marshmallow 6.0, Google decided that app storing on external SD card just won’t cut it. Due to security and overall performance risks, they decided to exclude this feature. Now, if you’re still using Lolipop or even older Android versions, you can still do it. Of course, if the app and device in question support transfer to an external SD card. </p>
<p> In addition, don’t get tricked into thinking that, once the app is transferred or installed on SD, it won’t store any data in internal storage. It will and it should. No matter how fast SD cards nowadays are, they’re still slower than internal memory. So, in order to reach a full potential, major data files are always stored on internal, phone’s memory. Thus, their primary value lies in the preservation of media files, like photos, videos or music, rather than in storing complex applications. </p>
<p> But that goes only for external memory. </p>
<p> Check the health of SD card and format it </p>
<p> Now, if you’re certain that the device, your apps, and OS at hand support transferring to SD card, we can move from there. These are the main suspects for comparable issues: </p>
<p> SD card is corrupted or formatted in the wrong format. </p>
<p> There’s not enough space on SD card. </p>
<p> App at hand is corrupted. </p>
<p> Because of that, we advise you to export what ever you can from the SD card to your PC and reformat it. It’s of utmost importance to format SD card in phone/tablet. Follow the instructions below to reformat the SD card and, hopefully, resolve the issue at hand: </p>
<p> Backup your data from the SD card on PC or cloud service of some kind. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> Open SD card. </p>
<p> Choose Format. </p>
<p> Now, if everything formerly mentioned is spot on, you should be able to transfer apps from the internal storage to the SD card. </p>
<p> Moreover, some users resolved the problem with the factory reset. Have in mind that this action will delete all your data, so make sure to back up everything before the start. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Open Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to the cloud or use PC suite provided by OEM to backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> Change SD card into internal storage </p>
<p> Once the major players like Google decide to make changes, you, as a user, have 2 options: to go with a flow or use older devices that are spared from changes but, consequently, lack some of the features. Yes, they decided to prevent apps-to-SD feature, but, at the same time, added something to mitigate changes. Namely, Android Marshmallow is the first Android OS that allows you to use an external SD card as internal storage. </p>
<p> There are some downsides, obviously, but, if you’re lacking storage space, this is a valid choice. It’s slower than integrated internal eMMC or UFC, so it’s not advisable to store demanding apps and games. One way or another, this is how to do it: </p>
<p> Tap Setup. </p>
<p> Select Use as internal storage. </p>
<p> The card will be formatted and all its data lost. </p>
<p> After that, your device will read the SD card as a part of internal storage. </p>
<p> That should conclude this article. In case you have questions or suggestions of any kind, we’ll be glad to hear from you in the comments below. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Fix: Apps won’t update or download on iPhone 7 </p>
<p> While we eagerly await for the Apple’s response to the renewed Android models in the flagship race, the iPhone 7 still stands firm as one of the devices still worth acquiring. Until the 10th-anniversary model appears, we must take closer attention to the one that’s currently the peak performer of the iPhone series. </p>
<p> Now, kudos to Apple for all-around system stability, but even the premium handsets are not error-free. One of those errors that can be quite a thorn in your side, is not uncommon with the iOS users. Namely, some users reported the issue with apps that won’t either download or update. To make things even more peculiar, some users managed to update apps while using Mobile Data, but the problem starts with the Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> For that reason, we prepared a list of possible solutions that should relieve you of this heavy burden. So, if you have identical or similar issues, make sure to check out the list below. </p>
<p> Check your Wi-Fi </p>
<p> With every connection-related troubleshooting, you should firstly eliminate the external cause. In this, like in so many other cases, your Wi-Fi router or its setup may be the problem. So, make sure to take some of these steps before we move on to the device itself: </p>
<p> Power off your router. Wait for approximately one minute and turn it on. </p>
<p> Still, if you’re unable to download and update apps after all of those, move on to the internal troubleshooting. </p>
<p> Check storage memory </p>
<p> This may seem too obvious but the overcrowded internal storage may cause this problem so it’s worth checking. Especially with the devices that run with 32 GB of the storage space. Additionally, some of the apps can accumulate a lot of needless data that you’re not even aware of. So, it’s worth to look into that. This is how you can check the data usage of the individual app: </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Tap Storage & iCloud Usage. </p>
<p> Under Storage, open Manage Storage. </p>
<p> Check the Documents & Data tab for unnecessary data. </p>
<p> If the app took to much data, you should reinstall it. </p>
<p> Tap the hogging app and choose Delete. </p>
<p> Navigate to Apple Store and redownload it. </p>
<p> You can repeat this procedure for all the apps that are taking a toll on your system storage. Moreover, when it comes to photos or other space-consuming multimedia files, we advise you to take the backup into consideration. With iTunes, you can backup and encrypt your data on your PC quite easily. That way you’ll have your sensitive data safe and your storage space relieved. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings </p>
<p> From time to time, your iPhone and router can get into some kind of confusion that may result in various connection problems. That, of course, heavily affects app updates. So, you may want to try and reset your network settings. Have in mind that this will erase all of your network-related settings, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth pairings and Mobile Data setup. If you’re up for it, this is how to do it: </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Select Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Your iPhone will restart and you’ll get the default setting configuration. Now, reconnect with the home network and try updating/downloading apps again from the Apple Store. </p>
<p> Delete backed up apps from iCloud Drive </p>
<p> Even though it sounds awkward, some users managed to resolve this issue by clearing the backed up app data from the iCloud. Namely, even though the iCloud shouldn’t interfere with the updates in any matter, it seems that it does. So, what you need to do is to delete the app data that’s backed up to your iCloud Drive and try updating again: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap iCloud (your name > iCloud on iOS 10.3 and later). </p>
<p> Open iCloud Storage. </p>
<p> Tap Manage Storage. </p>
<p> Tap Edit. </p>
<p> Now you can manage the files from the Storage. We advise you to delete all apps data just in case and check for updates later. </p>
<p> Use iTunes on your PC/Mac </p>
<p> If the all of the previous workarounds were of little or no avail, you can use an alternative way until the Apple address this issue in some of the upcoming patches. And that alternative is, you guess, iTunes client on PC/Mac. This is the great feature that easily overcomes the issues you may encounter with Wi-Fi. Follow these steps to update/download apps trough the iTunes: </p>
<p> Open the 3-dot drop-down menu in the upper left corner. </p>
<p> Open Apps. </p>
<p> Click Updates. </p>
<p> Click Update All Apps. </p>
<p> In a similar manner, you can download and install the apps via iTunes. This is how. </p>
<p> Connect your iPhone to the PC via USB. </p>
<p> Start iTunes desktop client. </p>
<p> Click iTunes Store. </p>
<p> Click on the 3-dot drop-down menu and select Apps. </p>
<p> Open App Store. </p>
<p> Find the App you want and click Get/Buy. </p>
<p> That should be it. With these steps, you should be able to resolve or at least overcome your app-related issues on iPhone 7. In addition, don’t forget to share your experience with this issue or ask any subject-related questions. We’ll be glad to help. </p>

<p> Fix: Asus ZenFone 3 fingerprint sensor not working </p>
<p> The fingerprint reader isn’t an exclusive anymore. Even some mid-range devices are now offering this security measure that’s faster and, arguably, more reliable than PIN, pattern or lengthy passwords. Asus ZenFone 3 has speedy and well-placed fingerprint scanner, that should serve all users in various operations besides just unlocking your device. </p>
<p> However, some users encountered issues with their reader after some time of use. Is it a hardware’s fault or is the software the reason for this, we can easily find out. And when we say software, we point our fingers at you, Nougat! Either way, we prepared some solutions that should help you resolve issues on your ZenFone. </p>
<p> If you have issues, the possible solutions can be found below. </p>
<p> Determine the culprit </p>
<p> Firstly, we need to locate the instigator of the problem. ”Is the problem inflicted by a hardware malfunction or just a software bug?” is an essential question for this and similar Android issues. For that purpose, you can use a simple code that should bring out the diagnostic menu so you can scan for hardware malfunctions. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to use the hidden diagnostic tool on your handset: </p>
<p> Open Calculator. </p>
<p> Type the following code: </p>
<p> .12345+= </p>
<p> Don’t put zero before the dot. </p>
<p> After you hit the Equal sign, you should see the Diagnostics menu. </p>
<p> Select Single test. </p>
<p> Choose Fingerprint test. </p>
<p> If you see the OK sign, it’s just a software bug. If the test shows that the hardware is faulty, you’re out of luck. </p>
<p> In case that the hardware is indeed faulty, make sure to contact your phone vendor or send a ticket to the carrier. On the other hand, if the problem is strictly related to software, make sure to check additional steps. Also, you can use this nifty procedure to test all kind of different handset features on your Asus device. </p>
<p> Clean it up </p>
<p> In addition to hardware and software, the problem may be just due to the dirty sensor. If it’s hot outside and your hands are sweaty, that can affect fingerprint reader and make the scanning unclear, too. So, make sure to wipe it with wet wipe gently and try again. Additionally, make sure that your hands are dry before use. That should improve readings. But, sadly, it helps only if the problem isn’t either hardware or software related. </p>
<p> Re-establish fingerprint </p>
<p> The first software-related workaround is to re-establish your fingerprint. This is a somewhat analogous to reset of the fingerprint scanner. Sometimes the scanner settings get corrupted and thus it can have a hard time with its readings. For that purpose, we advise you to follow these instructions and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Fingerprint. </p>
<p> Tap Manage Fingerprints. </p>
<p> Delete all Fingerprints and re-establish them again. </p>
<p> It’s critical to have dry fingerprints because of the precise readings. </p>
<p> If you’re unable to change those settings due to complete dysfunction of the fingerprint scanner, check the steps below. </p>
<p> Disable Launchers </p>
<p> Nova and other 3rd-party launchers are certainly a great way to completely customize everything about your device. Especially interface and lock screen. But, sadly, some Asus ZenFone 3 users reported issues with the fingerprint reader in combination with the 3rd-party launchers on Nougat. This goes only for users with the stock ROM. If you have flashed custom ROM, there’s a chance that everything will work as intended. At least, without launcher interfering with the fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Open drawer or navigate to Settings > Apps. </p>
<p> Find Launcher and uninstall it. </p>
<p> Restart your device and look for changes. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset </p>
<p> At the end, if you’re unable to get your fingerprint reader to work, and you’re certain that the hardware is operating as intended, you might want to take the factory reset into consideration. Before you get to reset settings to default values, make sure to backup your data on Google Drive or on your computer. </p>
<p> Once you’re certain that you have everything covered, you can finally move to a factory reset. This is how to do it: </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Factory Data Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Hopefully, that should relieve you of issues at hand, and you’ll be able to use the fingerprint reader just as before. </p>
<p> That should do it. If you have any questions or suggestion regarding this or similar problems with ZenFone 3, be so kind to share them with us. We’ll be glad to help. </p>

<p> My fingerprint sensor stopped working Zenfone 4Max and I tried all the above and it said my sensor was unclear and wouldn’t allow me to scan my fingerprint. Finally I did the old-reliable, restarted the phone and then it worked. Never underestimate the power of a reboot! </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> I have had my phone for approx 1 1/2 years. About a week after I purchased it brand new at 395.00, the wifi and bluetooth signals became non-existent. Contacted Asus and they refused to fix it because it was customer induced damage. Yeah right. I used to love their computers but I will not buy another asus product for a VERY long time if ever. And the Gorilla glass screen is a joke and not in a laughing manner. Had this phone a week, as yall know its already slick, but dropped it barley 2 feet. The screen cracked on… Read more » </p>

<p> Asus Zenfone 6 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus finally pushed the right buttons with the Zenfone 6, its first-ever flagship device. After years of irritating users with bloatware-stuffed mid-range phones, the transition to the flagship market also marks the fresh start for the company. </p>
<p> The Zenfone 6 is an affordable flagship powered by a near-stock Android. It follows the industry trends with its “gimmicky” rotating rear camera, but also implements some appealing features like the latest Snapdragon 855 chipset and massive 5,000 mAh battery. </p>
<p> However, even if everything looks in line on paper, real-life usage can uncover a problem or two. That’s why I compiled a list of the most common problems users have with the Zenfone 6. So, if you’re experiencing any of the mentioned problems, I hope you’ll find the solution here, or at least get to understand the situation better. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching it, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1: Rotating camera issues </p>
<p> The risks and rewards of getting a phone like the Zenfone 6 are obvious. You get more screen and better selfies for the price of constantly living in “fear” that the mechanism might go off at some point. Even though most durability tests show no problems with the camera unit, and Asus itself promises up to 100,000 rotations, there’s still that pinch of doubt that something might indeed go wrong. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, those doubts have become a reality for some users. Even though I (fortunately) haven’t found any reports saying that the camera mechanism is completely broken, there are still some annoying inconsistencies. </p>
<p> For example, the biggest problem right now appears to be the rattling sound camera makes on each rotation. While it doesn’t change the camera functionality, the noise is still annoying, and it adds up to the doubts you already have. </p>
<p> Since this is a hardware problem, there isn’t much you can do about it. In fact, you have three choices: live with the annoying noise and hope for the best; take your phone to the nearest authorized repair service and see if they can do something for you; replace your phone for the new one, and again, hope for the best. </p>
<p> Another reported problem is that the camera fails to lay back in its place. The drill is the same as for the rattling sound problem. </p>
<p> I definitely don’t recommend trying to fix the camera on your own with some old-school tricks like taping it with duct tape. Especially if you don’t know your way around mobile hardware. If you’re experiencing camera problems, it’s probably because your device slipped through Asus’ quality control. So, replacing it is usually the way to go. That’s why having a valid warranty for phones like the Asus Zenfone 6 is a must! </p>
<p> 2: Screen flickering </p>
<p> Screen flickering appears to be another widespread issue bothering the Zenfone 6 owners. Sure, the Zenfone 6 doesn’t have the best display in the market (it’s still an LCD panel), but that doesn’t mean users should have problems with it. </p>
<p> Right now, there doesn’t seem to be a viable solution for the screen flickering problem, as it’s most likely a software bug. So, your best bet is to keep checking for updates regularly, until Asus eventually releases a fixing update. </p>
<p> In the meantime, you can try a few workarounds that may or may not resolve the screen flickering issue on your Zenfone 6. It won’t hurt after all. </p>
<p> The first thing you should try is disabling the Adaptive brightness. Although some users report disabling this option doesn’t help, you might have better luck. Here’s how to disable Adaptive brightness on the Asus Zenfone 6: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Display > Adaptive brigtness. </p>
<p> Toggle Adaptive brightness off. </p>
<p> With Adaptive brightness off, you can set the brightness level to your liking. If disabling this option doesn’t help, you should probably stick to waiting for updates. I doubt factory reset will change anything, so it’s probably not worth the effort. </p>
<p> 3: Random reboots, freezes, and crashes </p>
<p> I’d like to give you some useful advice, but the past two problems, as well as this one, are mainly beyond the users’ reach. If you’re experiencing random reboots, or your phone randomly crashes or freezes, it’s probably been caused by a firmware update. </p>
<p> In fact, Asus itself confirmed this, per Android Police, saying that the .167 update (released in August 2019) triggered a motherboard malfunction causing all sorts of problems to users who installed it. </p>
<p> According to Asus, there’s no point in trying to fix this problem with software, because even if a certain update improves the stability of your phone, it’s only a temporary cover-up for the real problem, and any future update can potentially trigger the malfunction again. </p>
<p> Furthermore, Asus advises you to contact the service center. They will either replace the motherboard or give you an entirely new phone. </p>
<p> So, in case you got off on a wrong foot the day you bought your phone and got a faulty device, handing it over to the repair center is your only solution. I know this is an unnecessary hustle, especially for a phone coming from a company that’s specialized in manufacturing motherboards. But we should at least give props to Asus for being honest and straightforward to its customers, instead of trying to mask the problem with fancy statements. </p>
<p> 4: GPS not working </p>
<p> And finally, a problem you can solve yourself! While I can’t tell you exactly what causes the GPS to stop working on your phone, a few users confirmed that resetting the GPS and using assisted GPS data resolves the problem. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Location > Manage A-GPS state. </p>
<p> First, choose Download, to download assisted GPS data. </p>
<p> Now, choose Reset to reset your A-GPS settings. </p>
<p> If the problem persists, check out this forum thread, where the GPS issue on the Asus Zenfone 6 is deeper explored. </p>
<p> 5: Phone charges slowly </p>
<p> Before we start exploring the issue with slow charging, let’s first define “slow’. As you probably know, the Zenfone 6 boasts a massive 5,000 mAh battery. This behemoth requires more than two hours for the full replenish, even with fast charging. So, if your phone takes around two hours to fully charge, that’s perfectly normal, and you don’t need to do anything about it. </p>
<p> However, if your phone takes three or more hours to charge, you probably have a reason to worry. According to most reports, your phone isn’t even a problem. It’s the charger. If you’re using a faulty charger or a damaged cable, you’ll, obviously, have problems charging your phone. </p>
<p> So, try charging your phone with a different adapter or cable. If you notice better results, consider getting a new adapter/cable, and you shouldn’t experience any further problems. If a faulty adapter/cable isn’t a problem, after all, you can also try calibrating your battery. If you’re not sure how to do that, just follow the instructions from this forum post. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope this article helped you resolve your problems, and that you’re now able to use your brand new Zenfone 6 without any interference. If you recently encountered a problem I didn’t list here, feel free to share it with us in the comments below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/asus-zenfone-max-pro-m1-common-issues" parent_folder="web1" id="file17846120" filename="asus-zenfone-max-pro-m1-common-issues">
<p> Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> For a few years, Asus brings an interesting line of devices to the grand Android market. The Asus ZenFone 5 is the latest addition in their main iteration line, but there’s a device which took its glory, and it’s their own device called Max Pro M1. Besides the large battery and a fairly long name, this handset has everything a budget device (we can argue the M1 is a mid-range handset) should have. And, like any other handset, it has it’s small but visible flaws, bugs, and temporary (or permanent) problems. </p>
<p> We made sure to showcase the most prominent issues (apologies if we skipped on something). In addition, we enlisted some general troubleshooting steps for every issue. The advanced troubleshooting procedures are explained in detail at the bottom of the article. </p>
<p> 1: Multitouch/Ghost touch touchscreen issues </p>
<p> One would assume that the modern touchscreen panels won’t share the same issues with the ones from 10 years ago, Sadly, that’s not the case. Multitouch and ghost touch (delayed reaction or false touch) are the most prominently-reported issues on the ZenFone Max Pro M1. </p>
<p> Users are not sure whether the software or hardware is to be blamed for the aforementioned problems, and the support on the official forum isn’t exactly eager to jump in and provide the solution. </p>
<p> We have some solutions we can suggest but bear in mind that these won’t help if the touchscreen panel is faulty. Here’s what you can do to address the multitouch/ghost touch issues on the ZenFone Max Pro M1: </p>
<p> Disable Zen Motion Gestures. </p>
<p> Run the device in a safe mode. </p>
<p> 2: Slowdowns and freezes </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 363 and the more than capable GPU should provide users with a seamless use and a snappy experience. Of course, we’re looking at a lower mid-range device, so it’s unrealistic to expect ultra-high settings in some demanding games. Nonetheless, some users reported slouchy rendering and even lags during the standard use which shouldn’t be the case. </p>
<p> We have a few ways to reduce lags. Here’s what you can try: </p>
<p> Clear cache from the app which freezes the most. </p>
<p> Disable apps from working in the background. Greenify should serve the purpose. </p>
<p> Update your device for a possible update fix. </p>
<p> Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 3: Main and front camera issues </p>
<p> The camera is the main distinctive point between a flagship and a budget device. The camera setup on the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 is exactly what you can expect from a lower mid-range handset. Good enough on the daily light, with the dual-camera setup behind and 8 MP front lens. </p>
<p> Not bad at all and up to the trend. However, some users had issues with the camera app. Some of them experienced crashes while others are just not satisfied with the way taken photos are looking. For the former, we can blame the software. For the latter, the only resolution is to await updates or use a Google Camera port. </p>
<p> Boot into Safe mode and test the camera. </p>
<p> Clear Camera app’s data. </p>
<p> Update the device. </p>
<p> 4: Battery depletes fast </p>
<p> If we need to single out one selling point for this handset, we must say it’s the battery. The 5000 mAh battery is an amazing asset and the main reason why, even with the 6-inch display, the M1 has an astounding screen-on time. However, some users are not satisfied with the way the device works in the idle mode. Supposedly, the battery depletes substantially overnight, while the handset is completely idle. </p>
<p> But, don’t worry, this is most certainly related to software and we have a few tweaks which should reduce the battery consumption. </p>
<p> Kill the background apps with the built-in Manager. The aforementioned Greenify or a similar app might help to tweak the app’s behavior while working in the background, too. </p>
<p> Disable the Adaptive brightness and dim the brightness manually. </p>
<p> Disable Mobile Data Always On in the Developer Options menu. </p>
<p> Remove the unused widgets. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi overnight. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings after a system update. </p>
<p> 5: Wi-Fi and Mobile Data not working </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues are not as common on the Asus’ handset as on some other devices, but we still run into some reports and couldn’t skip on mentioning them. In the said reports, users were suffering from an unstable network reception on both Wi-Fi and Mobile Data, respectively. </p>
<p> Here are some steps to address this: </p>
<p> Delete all networks and try reconnecting. </p>
<p> Disable Always On for Mobile Data in Developer options. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Reset App preferences. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6: The fingerprint sensor is slow/unresponsive </p>
<p> We already wrote about the fingerprint issues on Asus ZenFone 3 and the ways to resolve them. This seems to be an ache for Asus, but that’s not a rule of thumb. It might be some an unfortunate coincidence. Either way, a few of ZenFone Max Pro M1 users have had a hard time with an unresponsive fingerprint scanner. Others aren’t satisfied with the speed it offers when unlocking the device. </p>
<p> We can’t make it work faster, but some of these steps might help you get it to work in the first place: </p>
<p> Run the diagnostic to determine what’s the nature of the problem. The .12345+= code typed in your dialer should start the fingerprint scanner diagnostics. </p>
<p> Re-configure the fingerprint. </p>
<p> Try booting into Safe mode and, if the fingerprint performs better, uninstall all recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Remove the tempered glass or cases which may cover the fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Clean the fingerprint sensor from a debris and greasy dirt with a wet cloth. </p>
<p> Reset your handset to factory settings. </p>
<p> 7: Auto-brightness doesn’t work </p>
<p> The auto-brightness or, what Google likes to call it, Adaptive brightness is an important built-in feature, especially as the screens are getting bigger and consuming more battery. It regulates the screen brightness based on the front ambient sensor readings. Some users had issues with the said sensor, as the screen fails to dim in the darker surroundings. </p>
<p> Here’s what you can do to address this: </p>
<p> Disable Adaptive brightness and restart your device. Re-enable it again. </p>
<p> Clean the front-facing top bezel where the sensor resides. </p>
<p> 8: Sound issues </p>
<p> Sound issues are also not as prominent, but some users are still experiencing bad sound output, especially on headphones. Others, and which might be a more delicate problem, have had a problem with the distorted in-call sound. This might be a result of a bad reception, but we still recommend checking some of the solutions we provided for general sound problems. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to improve the sound output on the ZenFone Max Pro M1: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Disable Absolute volume in Developer options. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> 9: Display color issues </p>
<p> Based on a few trusted reviews, the 6-inch LCD display on the Max Pro M1 is quite good. However, there are some isolated nuisances some users reported. This one single problem is rare but we still decided to put it on the list. Just in case. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to resolve the problem with the display color issues on the M1: </p>
<p> Disable Nightlight. </p>
<p> Change the color temperature to default or try Cool. </p>
<p> Boot into a safe mode and look for changes. </p>
<p> Reset the phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> 10: Important troubleshooting procedures for Zenfone Max Pro M1 </p>
<p> How to enable Developers options </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open System settings. </p>
<p> Choose About phone. </p>
<p> Locate the build number and tap on it 7 times to enable the Developer options menu. </p>
<p> Boot into Safe mode </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button until the Power menu appears. </p>
<p> Now, press and hold the Power button again until the “Reboot to safe mode” message appears. </p>
<p> Tap OK. </p>
<p> If the device works without restarting for some time, we suggest following the next steps. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition data </p>
<p> Shut down your handset. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and the Volume Down key until the device starts. </p>
<p> Use Volume keys (Up and Down) to navigate through the menu until you reach Recovery mode. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to choose the Recovery mode. </p>
<p> Once you see the Android with the exclamation mark, press and hold the Power button and, while holding it, single-press the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> Use Volume keys again to navigate through the Recovery menu and highlight ”wipe cache partition”. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to select it and confirm if asked. </p>
<p> The procedure should start and it will last for approximately 10 minutes. </p>
<p> Open Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> The device will restart and all your settings will be restored to default values. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this list of issues. We’ll try our best to add more issues over time, but you can help us, as well. Share your problems with Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 in the comments section below. We would be thankful for your effort. </p>

<p> Top 5 apps for making retro photos on Android </p>
<p> Retro is trendy again! And you like it. Whether it’s just because its popular, or dark, grainy photos please your eye, you have to admit that vintage photography has that special something. </p>
<p> So, it’s only natural that you want the same look for your photos. </p>
<p> Now, I don’t want to point any fingers, but many “retro cameras” you can find in the Play Store won’t take you too far. Sure, these apps offer some basic filters and options, but the result is usually dissatisfying. </p>
<p> On the other, there are a few legit tools that can help you make your photos like they were taken in the 90s. However, even those apps won’t just magically transform your photos. Any kind of editing requires skills and at least some basic knowledge of photography. So, don’t get your hopes too high, if you lack the skillset. Your photos simply won’t be as stunning as those of celebrities you keep seeing on your Instagram feed. </p>
<p> Huji Cam </p>
<p> Remember those disposable Fuji cameras all the cool kids had back in the 90s? Huji Cam brings that very same experience to your Android phone. Even the app’s interface resembles using a Fuji camera. That way, you’ll feel like you’re snapping photos with a physical camera, which is a nice touch. </p>
<p> But the representative looks is not the only feature Huji Cam has to offer. There are numerous filters, light leaks, and even dust effects that will transform your photos into a little piece of retro-looking art. The app even allows you to create “recipes”, which is a set of instructions you can apply to each photo you take, so you don’t have to edit it all over again. </p>
<p> In a sea of gimmicky apps that fail to live up to their Play Store descriptions, Huji Cam stands out. It’s probably the easiest app to use out of all the apps mentioned here, which creates a perfect balance. You could probably get better results with a more versatile app, but if you just want to make solid retro photos with minimal effort, Huji Cam is a way to go. </p>
<p> Huji Cam is available for free in the Play Store. However, there’s also a premium version that will give you even more options and tools to play with. </p>
<p> VSCO </p>
<p> VSCO is not your ordinary photo-editing app. It’s a blend of a decently powerful photo editor and a streamlined social network. The emphasis is on creativity, artistry and showcasing an author’s work, rather than on attention-grabbing, ego-feeding or peer-pressuring. Kind of like Instagram in reverse. </p>
<p> The app isn’t specifically designed for creating retro photos. However, it offers a toolset that allows you to implement any style you like. On top of that, retro is widespread on the platform, so you can even steal a few ideas, and implement them to your work. </p>
<p> When it comes to editing, VSCO offers numerous tools. Naturally, you’ll start by applying a filter. There are dozens of filters you can use, so you’ll have to go through them all until you find the one that gives that vintage look to your image. After choosing the right filter, you can further fine-tune your photo with various editing tools. You’ll probably want to adjust contrast, white balance, tint, and most importantly add grain. </p>
<p> The biggest downside of VSCO is that its not entirely free. In fact, you’ll have to pay for the premium version to gain access to the most (the best) filters. The free version is very limited, and it probably won’t allow you to fulfill every idea you have in mind. </p>
<p> All in all, VSCO is a great tool not just for retro photos, but also for editing in general. Plus you can use it as an alternative social network to showcase your work or get the new ideas. </p>
<p> Snapseed </p>
<p> Snapseed is a regular photo-editing app, and creating retro photos is not its primary function. However, creators of this tool (and that’s none other than Google!), have recognized the peak in popularity of this art form, so they’ve implemented a few features for editing photos the retro style. </p>
<p> Unlike most retrograms out there, Snapssed isn’t centered around filters, as there are only a few of them offered. Instead, this app gives you more freedom with its rich library of editing tools. </p>
<p> If we talk about features that specifically allow you to create retro photos, you’ll be happy to experiment with the Vintage feature, as it will probably give you better results than most filters in other apps. Of course, there’s also the Grainy film feature that will add additional effects to your photo, along with the grain effect. Because what’s a retro photo without overly-exposed grain? </p>
<p> For more advanced users, there’s the Curves tool that can help you fine-tune your photos, and give them that recognizable green or pink tint that characterizes pretty much every retro photo out there. </p>
<p> All in all, if you want to fully be in charge of editing your photos, instead of aiming for a filter to do the job for you, Snapseed might just be your cup of tea. </p>
<p> Adobe Lightroom </p>
<p> Adobe is a multimedia-editing-software juggernaut, of course its app is on the list. In fact, a few of Adobe’s apps could’ve made the cut, but I decided to go with Lightroom because it’s a choice of many professional and amateur photographers and artists. </p>
<p> Lightroom is the most advanced tool on the list. Its wide array of features allows you to do whatever you want with your photos. But as such, it’s also the most complex tool on the list, with the biggest learning curve. Nevertheless, once you find your way around it, rewards are plentiful. </p>
<p> Since we’re talking retro photos, there’s no need to dive deep into Lightroom’s limitless options and features. Instead, we’ll narrow it down our to the vintage-photo-creating tools. And in this department, Curves and Color mix are your best friends. Master these tools, and you’ll create stunning retro photos. </p>
<p> As I said, Lightroom requires commitment. Especially if you’re new to photo editing. But you’re not alone in this. There are numerous resources online, including an abundance of YouTube videos that explain how to use different techniques and styles. On top of that, Lightroom has its own Tutorial section where artists explain the fundamentals of editing. </p>
<p> I created a few nice retro-looking photos following the advice from Steven Wommack, so you should check him out. </p>
<p> Another great thing about Afterlight is that its free version offers just enough, so you don’t have to pay for the premium license. In fact, I only advise you to buy the subscription if you’re serious about photography, as its $11 a month, which is more than Netflix in some countries. </p>
<p> Vaporgram </p>
<p> Vaporgram is another level. It’s not a photo editor, it’s a meme-spawning machine! If you’re familiar with the vaporwave subculture, you’re going to love this app, as it allows you to create your own vaporwave photos and memes. </p>
<p> And as a vaporwave generator, it features everything you’d want from such an app. Want to glitch your images into oblivion? You got it! Want to add ridiculous light leaks, textures and effects? It’s all in there! </p>
<p> There’s also a wide range of filters that will enhance your creations even more. And if you’re really into creating surreal vaporwave magic, there’s a huge library of related images and frames you can add to your photos. </p>
<p> Of course, you can use this app for creating “regular” retro-looking images. In fact, this is probably the easiest-to-use app on this list. You can get stunning retro images with just a few taps (and right filters). Depending on the original material, you could get the best results with Vaporgram out of all the apps mentioned here. </p>
<p> Vaporgram is completely free to use, which makes this app even more appealing. There’s also a Premium version, but it won’t make a big difference. The main purpose of it is for you to support the developer, which you should definitely do, if you find Vaporgram to be your thing. </p>
<p> We conclude our list here. Playing with retro photos is fun and rewarding, but not always easy. So, whether you choose the hard or the easy way, you now have the tools. The only thing that could possibly limit you is your own imagination. And your skillset. </p>

<p> How to block a number in Android 9 Pie </p>
<p> Marketing can, more often than not, be dishonest. That statement is now more true than it’s ever been. Everyone’s competing for your time, attention and money. And in that pursuit, those who want a few easy bucks often throw all sorts of scams at you. </p>
<p> That’s why you’re receiving spam emails, calls and even texts daily. I know you’re not falling for it, because such calls or emails are relatively easily recognizable. But the volume of received spam offers can be overwhelming and annoying. </p>
<p> Even though most spammers use email to try to lure you into, well, handing them your hard-earned money, the number of spam calls and text has been on the rise for years now. That’s why I’m going to show you how to block those unwanted calls and messages, and save yourself from stressing out every time your phone rings. </p>
<p> On top of that, these exact methods can be used to stop someone else from harassing you. I don’t know, a stalker maybe, or whoever disrupts your daily routine with constant calls. </p>
<p> How to block a number in Android Pie </p>
<p> You might be under the impression that blocking a number in Android Pie requires some special effort. But that’s not true. The process is as straightforward as it gets. You can block any number in a matter of seconds and with just a few taps. </p>
<p> However, the procedure isn’t the same on all devices. As there didn’t use to be a way of doing this in general, phone manufacturers had to develop their own ways of blocking a number. So the process may vary depending on the phone you’re using. Nevertheless, the method is still easy, regardless of your phone’s manufacturer. </p>
<p> I’m going to give you an idea of how it’s done on phones from the most popular manufacturers. And if that’s not enough, just browse YouTube or XDA forums, and I’m sure you’ll find the exact instructions for your device. </p>
<p> Block a number in stock Android </p>
<p> If you’re using a phone that comes with stock Android out of the box, like the Pixel 3 or Xiaomi Mi A2, everything you need is already inside your system. There are two ways of doing this. Both are equally simple, so you can choose whichever you like more. </p>
<p> The first method is to open the Phone app, and switch to the Recents section. Now, long-press the number you want to block, and choose Block/report spam. Just confirm, and you won’t be receiving any more calls from that number. </p>
<p> Another way to block a number in stock Android Pie is through the stock Messages app. Just open Messages, long-press a contact within the Messages app and tap the Block icon (circle with a line through it). </p>
<p> As you can also see, you can both block a number and report it as spam. To learn more about the difference, as well as what happens to a number you marked as spam, check out Google’s official support page. </p>
<p> Block a number on Samsung phones </p>
<p> As much as everyone likes stock Android, chances are you’re not using a Google or Android One device. Instead, your phone comes with the manufacturer’s own ROM, like Samsung’s OneUI. And if you’re using a Samsung phone, here’s how to block a number in your version of Android Pie: </p>
<p> Open the Phone app. </p>
<p> Tap the three-dot menu, and go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap the Block numbers section. </p>
<p> Here you can manage blocked numbers. You can enter a number you want to block, or un-block already blocked numbers. </p>
<p> Bonus: You can also block calls from anonymous callers by toggling the Block anonymous calls option. </p>
<p> Block a number on Huawei phones </p>
<p> To block a number on Huawei devices, go the Phone app, find the number you want to block, tap and hold it, and choose Block contact from the dropdown menu. </p>
<p> If you want additional options, like blocking calls from unknown numbers, stay in the Phone app, tap the (three-dot) menu, and go to Blocked. Here you can create different call blocking rules, as well as block messages from a certain number. </p>
<p> Block a number on Xiaomi phones </p>
<p> To block a number on Xiaomi devices, do the following: </p>
<p> Open the Security app. </p>
<p> Tap Blocklist > Settings. </p>
<p> Enter the phone number you want to block. </p>
<p> Additionally, you can set more call blocking rules for other numbers. </p>
<p> Block a number on OnePlus phones </p>
<p> OxygenOS is a favorite custom ROM of many, mostly because of its resemblance to stock Android. Because of that, the process of blocking a number on a OnePlus device is the same as on stock Android. </p>
<p> Use an app </p>
<p> If you still can’t find a way to block a number natively, using a dedicated app is always an option. On top of that, an app will give a wider variety of options, so you can gain absolute control over who’s allowed to call or text you. </p>
<p> There are numerous number-blocking apps in the Play Store, and since they all have the same purpose, you can pick whichever app you find most suitable. I’m going to list one app here, called Calls Blacklist, simply because it’s the highest-rated app of this kind in the Store. </p>
<p> Calls Blacklist allows you to block a number from your call log, from your contacts, or to input the number automatically. There are also some handy additional features like blocking private numbers, unknown numbers, and non-numeric numbers. You can also bock SMS messages from a certain number. Another advantage of this app is that it keeps the log of all the blocked numbers, so you can manage them easily from a single place. </p>
<p> Will a blocked person know you’ve blocked them? </p>
<p> When you block a person’s number, they have no way of knowing that you’ve blocked them. Meaning, no one will receive a notification or a message saying something like “Jenny just blocked your number, stop being so pushy”, or something like that. </p>
<p> On the other hand, a blocked person will obviously notice that something’s wrong when they see they’re not able to make a call or send you a text message. When a blocked number calls you, the call will automatically disconnect, without reaching voicemail. Text messages, on the other hand, will go through normally for the sender, but you’ll never receive them. Also, the blocked number won’t get back the delivery notice. </p>
<p> That’s about it. Now you know how to block a number on your Android device (at least I hope so). If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, just let us know in the comments below. </p>

<p> Fix: Bluetooth issues on Samsung Galaxy S7 </p>
<p> Some wireless technologies fell behind, some of them are getting better and standing firmly. Bluetooth is, for some users, an essential part of the everyday use. Especially since the 3.5mm jack is slowly getting out of the picture for a lot of OEM’s. </p>
<p> However, the ever-growing Bluetooth standard isn’t of any use if you can’t connect or the connection is unstable. And some Galaxy S7 users experienced a lot of similar issues with their flagship device. Culprits can be different, and we’re not pointing our fingers in any direction, but the latest Android update must be the main suspect. After the update rolled out over over-the-air protocol, a lot of users reported various issues, including the Bluetooth failure. </p>
<p> Because of that, we prepared a few workarounds that should help you resolve Bluetooth-related issues. If you have had a hard time after the update, take into consideration the steps below. </p>
<p> Check the pairing device </p>
<p> First, we’ll need to determine is the pairing device functioning as intended before we move to phone-related steps. Make sure to check all of the devices that you’ve tried to pair with S7 and look for some issues. The best way is to try pairing with several devices in order to confirm that the problem is solely related to the phone rather than a car system, headset, or another phone compatibility. </p>
<p> Moreover, make sure to turn off Wi-Fi or Mobile Data while using Bluetooth since they may stall or even stop the connection. Of course, that can be quite an annoyance, so take that advice with reserve if you’re used to be online all the time, even when using Bluetooth pairing with car system or wireless headphones. </p>
<p> Once you’re sure that the S7 is the main reason for failed connection, especially after the Nougat update, move on to the steps below. </p>
<p> Update your firmware </p>
<p> After the upgrade to Nougat, users experienced various issues, with Bluetooth as one of the emerging problems, as well. Luckily, many problems were resolved with the next update, so make sure that you’re running the latest version of the Android OS on your S7 before we move to more complex steps. </p>
<p> If you’re uncertain how to check for updates on Samsung Galaxy S7, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap System update. </p>
<p> If the update is available, tap Install Now. </p>
<p> Once you’ve obtained the latest system version, make sure to check for changes as, hopefully, they should be gone. If not, check additional steps. </p>
<p> Reconnect with the pairing device </p>
<p> The first step you can use to address Bluetooth-related issues is to delete paired devices and connect again. Most of the time, due to the signal corruption of some kind, the problem can be solved with this simple approach. Sadly, you’ll need to reestablish the Bluetooth pairing again, but that’s a small inconvenience compared to the inability to use Bluetooth at all. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to delete and reconnect with the paired device: </p>
<p> Locate paired devices. </p>
<p> Tap Forget. </p>
<p> Restart your phone and connect again. </p>
<p> In addition, you can decide to reset Network settings and completely restore factory values for all connection-related settings. However, this will erase all custom settings and saved networks, including Mobile Data preferences. </p>
<p> If you want to try it out, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup and Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Settings to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> By wiping the cache partition data, you clear temporary files that are stored to speed up certain apps and features without deleting your data from the internal storage. They are here for a purpose, but albeit, they can cause problems. But why would you do that and how is this related to Bluetooth issue? Well, it’s not advised to perform this recovery procedure is everything is functioning as it should. </p>
<p> But, sometimes, updates like the above-mentioned Nougat can cause corruption in the cache cycles and cause issues with certain apps or features. Bluetooth isn’t an exception, and neither are other connectivity networks, like Wi-Fi, Mobile Data, NFC, and others. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to try this procedure since it won’t cost you anything except some time and it may help gradually in addressing the issue at hand. Follow the instructions below to wipe cache partition data on your Samsung Galaxy S7: </p>
<p> Make sure that the battery is at least at 20% and Turn Off the device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the combination of Volume Up, Home, and Power Keys. </p>
<p> Wait until the Android System Recovery screen appears and release all keys. </p>
<p> Use the Volume Down key to scroll down to ”Wipe cache partition”. </p>
<p> Select ”Wipe cache partition” with the Power button. </p>
<p> Use the Volume Down key to highlight ‘Yes’ and press the Power button to confirm. </p>
<p> After the procedure is finished, confirm ‘Reboot system now’ with the Power button. </p>
<p> That should resolve some of the issues that may have emerged due to the latest update. However, in case you’re still unable to use S7 Bluetooth as before, a factory reset may be the only available solution. Of course, if the problems aren’t hardware-related. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings </p>
<p> At the end, if the Bluetooth is of essential value for your everyday use, factory reset is not an unreasonable workaround. Yes, you’ll lose all of your settings and data from the internal storage, but it’s the safest bet to resolve software-related issues. As we have witnessed in the past, developers occasionally make a lot of mistakes and roll out the unprepared and unoptimized update. </p>
<p> Sadly, once you’ve updated your Android OS and the plethora of problems emerged from Pandora box, you have only two choices: to wait for the next patch that should fix things properly or perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> If you decided to perform a factory reset, these steps should inform you how to do it: </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Restore. </p>
<p> Choose Factory Data Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Device. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and insert your passcode or PIN. </p>
<p> After that, your Bluetooth should be work just like before. </p>
<p> With that, we wrap it up. In case you have any questions or suggestion of any kind, we’ll be glad to hear from you. The comments section is below. </p>

<p> Fix: Bluetooth calls not working on Android 10 </p>
<p> In the current state of affairs, with all major OEMs avoiding headphone jacks as plague, Bluetooth audio is for many a preferable option. If not for the outspoken audio output (quality isn’t comparable to wired solutions), then for handsfree calls. It seems that some users on Android 10 have had issues with that, as Bluetooth calls are not working anymore. </p>
<p> Android 10 broke Bluetooth audio in calls </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Reboot your phone and clear cache </p>
<p> Let’s start by rebooting your device. Some users also managed to address the problem by enabling and then disabling Airplane mode so it’s worth a shot. </p>
<p> Next step is to navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps and enable System services. After that, locate the Bluetooth app and clear cache and data from it. Reboot your device once again and test Bluetooth again. </p>
<p> If the issue persists and Bluetooth audio in calls is not working at all or crackling, continue to the next step. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Update firmware </p>
<p> The next thing to do is to check for possible updates. There’s a lot of reports related to Bluetooth issues after upgrading to Android 10. The issues that were non-existent on Android 9. </p>
<p> Hopefully, OEMs addressed the problem with patches and that’s the reason why you should keep your device up to date. Check for updates in Settings > System and install any available updates. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Remove headphones/car system and pair them again </p>
<p> It’s hard to pinpoint the exact cause for the issue but removing and pairing devices again usually helps. What you’ll need to do is delete the troublesome device (be it wireless headphones or car system) from the list of paired devices and try pairing again. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to remove and pair again Bluetooth device with your phone: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Open Paired devices. On some Android skins, you’ll need to be connected with the audio device in order to access the option to Unpair. If that’s the case, turn on Bluetooth and connect to the headphones/car system. </p>
<p> Tap Unpair. </p>
<p> Restart your phone, navigate to Settings > Bluetooth again and pair with the audio device again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Enable Phone calls </p>
<p> Some OEMs also have a toggle to enable or disable phone calls on a particular paired Bluetooth device. Make sure that Phone calls are indeed enabled under that particular device. </p>
<p> This is how to ensure that Phone calls are enabled for a Bluetooth device: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Tap on your device on the Paired devices list. </p>
<p> Toggle On Phone calls. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Disable Bluetooth A2DP Hardware Offload </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can take a step forward and tweak Bluetooth-related Developer options. There are more than a few options you can just change to System default. Also, you can switch to AVCRP version 1.6 instead of 1.4 which is the default one and change codec to AAC. </p>
<p> The most important one and the one that usually addresses the problem is Bluetooth A2DP Hardware Offload. You need to disable that option. </p>
<p> Here’s how to access Developer options and tweak Bluetooth settings: </p>
<p> On your phone, open Settings > About phone (or System). </p>
<p> Tap on the Build number seven times. </p>
<p> Get back to Setting where you should see Developer options. </p>
<p> Navigate to Disable Bluetooth A2DP Hardware Offload and toggle it off. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Reset Network Settings </p>
<p> If none of the previous steps worked for you and Bluetooth calls are still not working on Android 10, make sure to reset Network Settings. Have in mind that this will erase all SSIDs and Bluetooth paired devices. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to restore Network Settings to their default values: </p>
<p> Choose System or General management. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Then select Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Reset your device to factory settings </p>
<p> And, finally, if even resetting of Network Setting fell short, the only thing we can suggest is to factory reset your device. This won’t downgrade your device to Android 9 Pie but it should address issues that awoken after OTA update to Android 10. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset your Android device to factory settings: </p>
<p> Back up your data from the internal storage (photos can be saved to Google Photos, other media can be saved to an external storage or a PC). </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > System > Reset. </p>
<p> Select Factory data reset. </p>
<p> Follow instructions to reset your device to factory values. </p>
<p> That’s a wrap. Thank you for reading and please tell us if any of these steps helped you address the issue or not. The comments section is below. </p>

<p> Fix: Bluetooth won’t work after updating to iOS 12 </p>
<p> iOS 12 is finally here. Besides a few visual and practical improvements, this iOS iteration is mostly about the optimization and performance enhancement. And, judging on the preliminary reactions, it does substantially improve all eligible devices. With a few hiccups along the way. In this case, there seems to be a Bluetooth problem. Namely, affected users who tried to access the Bluetooth menu in Settings experienced black screen and crash to the homepage. </p>
<p> We conducted research and found some possible solutions to the problem at hand. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Restart your device </p>
<p> This might be the temporary stall caused by the recent system update. Until everything settles, minor bugs or unpolished features might emerge. The resolution is often a simple restart which allows the handset to reset the system processes. In this case, Bluetooth. </p>
<p> In addition, after the restart, you can remove all pairings and pair your phone again via Bluetooth. That seems to fix the problem for some affected iPhone users. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Reset Network Settings </p>
<p> If the problem is persistent, resetting Network settings might help. The best way to ensure full optimization after a major update is to reset your handset to factory values. However, we might try a more simple and less time-consuming option first. If your Bluetooth menu is still crashing to the homepage, resetting Network Settings is the next obvious step. </p>
<p> Have in mind that this will relieve you of all saved passwords and personalized settings, so you’ll need to re-establish those again. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset Network Settings to default values: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Choose Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clean install iOS 12 </p>
<p> Finally, as we already mentioned here and in some other iOS 12- related articles, the clean update installation is the safest way to avoid a huge spectrum of issues. Including the Bluetooth crashing, we’re trying to address today. </p>
<p> The surplus of configuration differences will result in a bug upon the system update. What we need is a clean slate state of your device. Installing iOS 12 on a stock device is faster and will help you avoid further issues. </p>
<p> Here’s how to clean install iOS 12 on an iPhone or iPad: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Don’t forget to backup your data before you confirm. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and start the process. </p>
<p> Skip restoring the backup and update to iOS 12. </p>
<p> Later on, you should choose Restore from the iCloud Backup feature. </p>
<p> That’s it. If you’re still having a hard time with one or several features, make sure to contact Apple support. In addition, if you’ve found an alternative way to resolve the Bluetooth problem after an update to iOS 12, feel free to tell us in the comments section. Thanks for reading. </p>

<p> How to swiftly bypass forgotten Password, PIN or Screen Pattern on your Android </p>
<p> Phone security measures importance is indubitable. Nowadays, mobile devices are valid parts of our lives and they contain private content, messages, photos or other sensitive data. We all can agree that even the closest members of our family or friends have limited access to it. It’s just too private, stop asking, mom! As security goes, there have been 3 built-in security measures in Android since the OS was introduced and they still do the job. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, sometimes you are changing it frequently or haven’t used the phone for the while and, suddenly, you are trying to unlock it in vain. The password/pattern/PIN are forgotten and your world is breaking down. </p>
<p> After you try for several times and the phone perma-locks itself, you ‘ll probably start looking for alternative ways. Don’t worry, there are some routes to bypass the security. It is not easy, because if it was, that security would be lame. For that reason, in many situations, the only working solution would be the factory reset that leads to losing all of your data. </p>
<p> We brought you some of the possible solutions, so be sure to try them out. </p>
<p> Bypass security with Google account (Android versions older than 4.4 KitKat) </p>
<p> Older devices running Android 4.4 KitKat had an interesting built-in option for recovering your phone. Later on, they removed it. If you are using a device with this OS version, follow the instructions: </p>
<p> Enter PIN/Password/Pattern 5 times in a row. </p>
<p> You ‘ll be prompted with Forgot PIN/ Forgot Password /Forgot Pattern button. </p>
<p> Tap it. </p>
<p> Next step asks you to enter your Gmail address and password of an account associated with your Android. The one you entered for Play Store. </p>
<p> Once you are logged in, follow all steps and unlock your device. </p>
<p> Use Samsung Find My Mobile or unlock remotely </p>
<p> Some manufacturers have the option to register on their website and control your phone remotely. Samsung’s Find My Mobile is a proved option for all Samsung users. Of course, you have to be registered and know your login credentials. Also, connected to Wi-Fi or Mobile Data. To do so, follow the instructions: </p>
<p> If your phone is registered to the account, it should be in the left upper corner. If it is the case, continue. </p>
<p> On the left, you ‘ll see the options panel. Select Unlock My Screen. </p>
<p> Wait for a moment and the phone should unlock. </p>
<p> Use Android Device Manager to unlock your device </p>
<p> Android Device Manager is Google’s app solution for remotely controlling your device in case you lost it or get it locked. If Android Device Manager is installed on your device, you could use it to unlock the phone. To do so and save yourself a trouble, follow the instructions. Your device will also need connection via Wi-Fi or Mobile Data. </p>
<p> Enter the temporary password, you ‘ll use later to unlock the phone. </p>
<p> Click Lock again. </p>
<p> The password field should appear on your phone. </p>
<p> Enter the temporary password and that is it. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory settings ( All data will be lost) </p>
<p> This is the last option for all of you troubled souls that forgot their PIN/Password/Pattern is reset to factory settings. By pressing the combination of your device buttons, you could get it reset to factory settings. This will clear all security measures and you can start from the scratch. Be sure to remove the SD card or it will be also deleted. To do so follow the instructions. </p>
<p> Turn Off your device. </p>
<p> Entering Recovery Mode differs from model to model so you should google it. We tried it out with Samsung Galaxy S6. </p>
<p> Press and hold Power, Home, and Volume Up buttons simultaneously until the Recovery Mode starts. </p>
<p> Use Volume buttons to scroll trough the given options and select Wipe Data/Factory Reset by pressing Power button. </p>
<p> Select Erase All User Data. </p>
<p> That should do it. The device will restart and start the Factory Reset. </p>
<p> This were our tips to fix unlock your Android device in case of forgotten password. We hope you ‘ll find it helpful. Next time try to write down your password/pattern/PIN or be sure to have a backup solution in case this occurs again. If you know any other ways of bypassing the security measures, feel free to share it with us. Good luck! </p>

<p> 5 Best Free Call Recording Apps for iPhone </p>
<p> ‘Locked up’ nature of Apple devices have some pros but, unquestionably, there are some cons to it also. On one side, there is an excess of various options, while on the other we are unable to work out some simple things. </p>
<p> The good example is call recording directly from your device. Who would think that such premium device is unable to execute such a simple task? In the Apple’s defense, the privacy laws are forbidding the recording of calls in some states including the USA. That, of course, haven’t stopped third-party solutions to earn a formidable amount of money for this service. </p>
<p> Today, we are presenting you the best free apps that enable you to record a call on your iPhone. The paid solutions are arguably better performing but they come at the price. So if you are not keen to spend a lot on call recording premium apps, you’ll find some viable options on this list. </p>
<p> Note: All of the listed apps require 3 way-calls option on your iPhone. </p>
<p> Record My Talk Free </p>
<p> Record My Talk Free is not ‘free’ in the sense you would imagine. Yes, in a free version you’ll get all the premium-like features but there is a catch. Playback of the recordings is limited to 60 seconds. If that isn’t a deal-breaker for you, this app is worth trying out. At least you get to know what are you buying in case you decide to spend some money. </p>
<p> When it comes to the features, Record My Talk offers: </p>
<p> User-friendly interface. </p>
<p> Recording option for both incoming and outgoing calls. </p>
<p> Organizing your recordings. </p>
<p> Sharing any of your recordings via email or social networks. </p>
<p> Edigin Call Recorder </p>
<p> Edgin Call Recorder is specific recording app for your iPhone. It stores your recordings in the cloud platform instead of your phone’s storage. You can access your recordings anytime from any thinkable device. In addition, all recordings are downloadable from an organized folder. The recordings are clear and the cloud service is password protected and therefore, safe. One would ask himself where is the catch with this simple but amazing software? Well, you have to sign a contract with the Edgin in order to use the app. </p>
<p> If you don’t mind some paperwork, this app can prove as a great solution for call recording. After you contact the supplier, the app can be downloaded here. </p>
<p> Call Recorder Free </p>
<p> Call Recorder Free packs almost similar call recording features as the Record My Talk Free. As the matter of fact, they even share the same boundaries when it comes to premium-over-free catch. You can listen only 1 minute of your recordings. With that exception, all of the pro features are available in the free version. </p>
<p> Recording of incoming calls </p>
<p> Recording of outgoing calls </p>
<p> Easy accessible recordings list </p>
<p> If you want to try out the Call Recorder, follow the link. </p>
<p> Google Voice </p>
<p> Google Voice is, on the first sight, somehow similar with Edgin Call Recorder. Namely, it is free but requires an account created on Google Voice site. And there all of the similarities stop. </p>
<p> This application is one of, if not the best solution for VOIP calls with call recording addition. And much more features that are not related to the subject. Nevertheless, there is, and you can probably guess by now, the catch. You can record and save a full length of incoming calls. But not the outgoing ones. Additionally, you are obligated to port your number ti Google Voice, in order to record in the first place. </p>
<p> Google Voice update is near so we hope that some of the call recording features can be upgraded. </p>
<p> Call Recording by NoNotes.com </p>
<p> As the Google Voice is the most viable free long-term solution, NoNote’s Call Recording app is best for short-terms. Why? Well, first of all, registration is easy and safe so you’ll work it out in no time. Second, if there is just that one call of great importance, this app offers you free 20 minutes at the start. And every month you’ll get another free 20 minutes. Feature-wise Call Recording offers some remarkable options: </p>
<p> The Bottom Line </p>
<p> All of the above options are free to try out, so you can swipe trough them and find the one that suits you best. However, as we already stated, most of the subject related apps available are much more useful in its premium form. Do you have any other apps worth mentioning? Be sure to tell us and share with us your experience. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/cant-import-photos-iphone" parent_folder="web1" id="file17846799" filename="cant-import-photos-iphone">
<p> Fix: Unable to import photos from iPhone to PC or Mac </p>
<p> Due to the exclusiveness of Apple products, you can count on almost flawless and most secure file transfer between the devices. Just a few clicks and your photos are copied to your PC/Mac with a no hustle at all. At least, most of the time. </p>
<p> Namely, some users reported issues with photo/video importing on PC/Mac and we’ll today try to figure it out and help you resolve those and similar issues. So, if you’re experiencing something that resembles this, make sure to check the steps below. We hope you’ll find it informative and helpful. </p>
<p> Make sure that the files are not corrupted </p>
<p> Before you start with the sending files and encounter the emerging problem, make sure that the videos can be played on your device. If the certain video has a prefix ‘null’, there’s a chance that it’s unreadable. On the other hand, if you’re able to access and open photos and videos on your iPhone, but the importing is giving you a hard time, make sure to check the steps below. </p>
<p> Update iTunes </p>
<p> It’s imperative for you to run the latest version of iTunes in order for everything to function as intended. Namely, some user reported resolution of the problem once the latest version of the iTunes client was obtained. Additionally, some users are more keen to use alternative programs for importing photos or videos. Even though those are better for some other things, we advise you to use native application to transfer your files between iPhone/iPad and PC. </p>
<p> This is the procedure to update your iTunes desktop client: </p>
<p> Start the iTunes client. </p>
<p> Under the menu bar, open Help. </p>
<p> Click on Check for updates. </p>
<p> Send photos via email </p>
<p> Another valid solution is to send your photos trough email. Photos quality will be marginally decreased or not at all, and you’ll be able to access them on your PC without all the troubles that standard import procedure may inflict. Just create an attachment with all of the wanted photos and send it to yourself. </p>
<p> Sadly, due to limits inflicted by mail services, you won’t be able to send larger files, including videos. But the photos should be easy to send and store later on your PC. </p>
<p> Use AirDrop for Mac or alternatives for Windows </p>
<p> AirDrop is nifty, built-in ad-hoc service that enables you to send files from any iOS device to Mac. It utilizes both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and it’s a great way to overcome standard issues with transferring files via the mass storage access. You’ll need at least OS X Yosemite and iOS 7 in order to use this feature. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to utilize AirDrop and send photos/videos via wireless connection: </p>
<p> Choose Go > AirDrop on your Mac and Enable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Allow your Mac to receive files. </p>
<p> On your iPhone/iPad, tap Control Center and enable AirDrop. This will automatically enable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Find adequate username and connect with your Mac. </p>
<p> If you’re signed into the same iCloud account, files will be transferred automatically. </p>
<p> However, if you’re using Windows-powered PC, you won’t be able to use this exclusive Apple technology to send your files, in this case, photos and videos. For that purpose, we advise you to check some of the most common similar tools for wireless data transferring. You should check these out. </p>
<p> Both are quite reliable, with exquisite transfer speeds and more than a few distinctive perks. </p>
<p> That should do it. If you have any questions or suggestion regarding this subject, don’t be shy to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: ”Application Not installed” error when installing from Play Store or APK file </p>
<p> There’s no OS without issues. And Android is sometimes prone to problems just due it’s massively used with so many smartphone manufacturers. One error that’s not common but can diminish your will to live is ”Application Not Installed”. It affects certain only certain apps but we can’t say for sure which are those. </p>
<p> So, if you’re sure that you installed the troubled app properly (either via Play Store or APK), but the error keeps popping up, we advise you to check the solutions we prepared below. </p>
<p> Hopefully, with our little help, you’ll be able to resolve the issue. </p>
<p> Clear Play Store’s app cache and data </p>
<p> If you’re using stock Android, this should be the first troubleshooting step. Namely, cache and data that are stored in the Play Store app can get corrupted and thus cause the issues with future downloads and updates. Yes, they’re both useful, either for speeding up app-processes or storing essential setting. However, it’s advised to clean them from time to time. </p>
<p> If you’re unsure how to clean Cache and Data from the Play Store app, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Tap Play Store and open the Storage. </p>
<p> Clear Cache and Data. </p>
<p> Restart your device and try downloading an app again. </p>
<p> Reinstall app </p>
<p> Some apps are just gonna make a bad first impression. That’s rarely the case, but certain apps, especially demanding games, can start with you on the wrong foot. Of course, it’s imperative that you cover the requirements. If it’s there, it doesn’t mean that you can run it. But, if you’re certain that you can and error is persistent in its goal to ruin your experience, just try to reinstall it. </p>
<p> Moreover, some users reported that, after the deeper analysis, they get the things going by removing all of the app-related media from the device. For example, if you use WhatsApp and it starts to misbehave, uninstall it and delete WhatsApp-related folders. Backup saved photos from your conversations and delete it. Later on, install WhatsApp again and the problem should be resolved. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to do so with any app that’s flawed: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Apps. </p>
<p> Open the troubled app and choose ”Uninstall”. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Use File Explorer of some kind to navigate to the app-related folder and delete it. </p>
<p> Restart your device again. </p>
<p> Open Play Store and install the app. </p>
<p> Check for changes. </p>
<p> Make sure that you have enough storage space </p>
<p> Besides many other things that can cause this error, lack of storage space is probably at the top of the list. You must be aware that the app can take much more data than its original size. In addition, media files tend to pile up quickly. If you don’t have support for external storage, your internal storage may suffer. </p>
<p> Follow the tips below to clean up your storage: </p>
<p> Use SD card (if supported) for media files like music, photos, videos etc. It can be used for apps, as well, but that might cause additional issues. We’ll explain it below. </p>
<p> Use Google Drive or the 3rd-party cloud service of choice to upload your data. Delete it afterward. </p>
<p> Clear data from apps. It will reset your settings or login credentials but will grant you some storage space. </p>
<p> Uninstall unused apps. If you don’t use it on weekly basis, there’s a chance that you don’t need it, don’t you agree? </p>
<p> Switch from SD to Internal storage </p>
<p> Sometimes, especially with the older Android handsets, you might decide to use SD to install apps. They’ll still run through internal storage, but most of the installation data will be stored on SD card. Now, you can even format an SD card initially as the internal storage on Marshmallow or Nougat. However, as we already stated before, SD card is much better for storing media files. </p>
<p> In other words, SD card as the main storage might cause errors, especially due to slower reading speeds. Because of that, we recommend making sure that the internal storage is where all apps are downloaded and installed. </p>
<p> Follow the steps below to set the Internal Storage as default: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Navigate to Storage. </p>
<p> Change Default Storage to Internal. </p>
<p> Try updating again. </p>
<p> Enable the ”Unknown Sources” feature in Settings </p>
<p> Now, let’s move to APK issues. APK installation shouldn’t cause any problems. It might be dangerous since some apps from third-party sources can get you in trouble, but, we’re sure that most of them are as trustworthy as the ones on Play Store. However, if you’re running a stock Android (and most users does), you’ll need to allow third-party installation files. </p>
<p> If you’re not sure how to do that, these instructions should help you: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Advanced and open Security. </p>
<p> Scroll down and enable Unknown Sources. </p>
<p> If you already have that app installed (even different version), make sure to uninstall it and restart your device. </p>
<p> Navigate to the folder where the APK is stored and install it. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Some users reported further issues related to updating APK app over Play Store. Have in mind that certain apps can’t be updated if they’re not in the Play Store list. For that, you’ll need a custom ROM and a third-party updater. But it’s unlikely for that to happen with the majority of the mainstream apps. </p>
<p> Make sure that APK file isn’t corrupted or incomplete </p>
<p> There are dozens if not hundreds of viable choices if you’re keen to download APK. However, as we mentioned, that’s not the stock Android in its true nature. Why? Well, you’ll need to inform about the system requirements since not all apps are supported by older Android devices (KitKat and earlier). The second thought goes to file completion. You’ll need a proper APK file in order to install and run it on your device. </p>
<p> Also, some users transfer archived files instead of just APK, which can be a problem, depending on tools you have on your device. Built-in file explorers aren’t always suited to do WinRar’s job. So, basically, you have 3 choices: </p>
<p> To extract the APK file on your PC and transfer it like that to your device. </p>
<p> To use File Explorer or similar app for extraction on your Android. </p>
<p> And, to use some kind of PC Android Suite to perform these actions. </p>
<p> It’s completely your choice. If APK is spot on, you should have an easy time installing it. In addition, the above-mentioned error should be out of the way. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition data </p>
<p> Until now, we tried to address the app-related issues. However, if the problem is within the system, some more advanced measures are needed. After some time, for various reasons, you can encounter strange errors that weren’t there before. Unoptimized and unpolished updates are the main reason. </p>
<p> Now, since there’s no a simple way to downgrade the OS, at least, on stock Android, you can always wipe cache partition and remove possible errors within the cache partition. This action won’t lead to losing your data, and it will clear system cache. </p>
<p> This is how to wipe the cache partition in Android: </p>
<p> Make sure that the battery isn’t completely depleted and power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> Once the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate through the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Have in mind that the access procedure can vary on different Android devices. </p>
<p> That should relieve you of possible corruptions in system cache and the issue at hand should be resolved. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the above steps helped you to resolve the problem at hand, a factory reset might be the only thing you can turn to. The reasoning behind is similar to the reasoning behind cache partition wipe: after some time of extensive use or due to an update, things can go wrong. </p>
<p> If (when) that happens, make sure to backup your data, from both internal and external memory to a Google Drive or PC, and proceed to a factory reset. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Factory Data Reset. </p>

<p> Fix: Unable to open Contacts on Android </p>
<p> It appears that the problem with accessing the Contacts app in Android is an ongoing issue. And if you’re reading this article, chances are you have the same problem. </p>
<p> People don’t expect from such a simple app to cause any problems. And it’s very simplicity leaves us a very little space for troubleshooting. Contacts barely has a Settings page, which makes users wondering if there’s anything they can do to resolve this problem. </p>
<p> Luckily, the problem usually doesn’t lie in the Contacts app itself. It’s usually other apps or services that are blocking Contacts from opening. So, we’re going to investigate the case in this article and bring your precious contacts back to you. </p>
<p> Fix: Can’t open Contacts on Android </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Free up some memory </p>
<p> Believe it or not, contacts occupy memory, too. Unless you keep them in your Google account. So, if your contacts are stored locally, and your phone memory is low, there can be some interferences. </p>
<p> Before you do anything else, make sure you have enough free memory on your phone. If your phone’s memory is low, delete some unnecessary apps, or clear the cache, and you should be good. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you have enough memory, but the contacts are still ‘broken’, move on to another solution. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Disable the Google+ app </p>
<p> Some users who have encountered this problem before suggest that disabling or uninstalling the Google+ app solves the problem. I can’t tell why Google+ causes interferences with the Contacts. But, disabling it may solve the problem. </p>
<p> Here’s how to uninstall the Google+ app: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Navigate to Apps & notifications, and tap See all apps. </p>
<p> Tap Google+, and go to Uninstall. </p>
<p> Reboot your phone. </p>
<p> This is all good if you’re not using Google+. You won’t miss it. But if you do use Google’s social network, I doubt you’ll want to get rid off it for such a bizarre reason. In that case, just stop the app, reboot your phone, and hopefully, you’ll solve the problem. </p>
<p> Here’s how: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Apps & notifications, and tap See all apps. </p>
<p> Tap Google+, and go to Force stop. </p>
<p> Don’t forget to reboot your device. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Delete old voicemails </p>
<p> Another thing that can cause problems with contacts is your voicemail service. Numerous users say that deleting old voicemails actually solves this problem. So, if previous solutions didn’t work for you, go and delete your old voicemail messages. Maybe you’ll solve the problem. </p>
<p> This one’s actually a bit tricky. Because it depends on your carrier. Although we know old voicemails can actually cause the problem, nobody ever confirmed which carriers’ voicemail services cause the contacts issue. And I can’t tell you if your carrier is on ‘the list’. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check the app permissions </p>
<p> The Contacts app should have the permission to access your contacts by default. And that’s how it is most of the time. But the Contacts app may lose that permission for any reason. Maybe it’s a faulty update, or you just disabled the permission by accident. </p>
<p> Either way, you should go and check if such permission is granted. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Navigate to Apps & notifications, and tap Permissions > Contacts. </p>
<p> Make sure the Contacts app has the permission to use contacts by toggling it on. </p>
<p> That’s about it. At least one of these solutions should help you access the Contacts app on your Android phone again. But if you actually can access the app, but the concepts are just not there, don’t worry, we’ve got you covered, as well. </p>
<p> Fix: Contacts not showing on Android </p>
<p> If you can one the Concats app, the contacts are just not there, congratulations on your new phone! There are just two scenarios that come to my mind when it comes to vanished contacts. You either just got a new phone and have yet to set it up, or you simply logged out of your Google account. </p>
<p> Let’s break it down. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Just log in to your Google Account </p>
<p> If you’re not signed in to your Google Account, your phone cannot import contacts associated with it. Well, just sign in with your Google Account, and you should be good. </p>
<p> Don’t worry your phone will remind you to that every second, so you don’t really need a tutorial on that one. Once you’ve set up your Google Account, contacts associated with it should appear automatically. </p>
<p> Unless… </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Sync your contacts with Google Account </p>
<p> If you’ve ever used your Google Account on an Android phone before, your contacts should sync automatically. However, there’s a chance you still cannot see your contacts, in which case you’ll have to sync them manually. </p>
<p> To do that, you’ll have to login with your Google Account to your old phone, and copy the contacts by yourself. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Users & accounts. </p>
<p> Find your Google Account (email). </p>
<p> Tap Account Sync. </p>
<p> Make sure Contacts are toggled. </p>
<p> Wait a couple of minutes for Google to sync contacts. </p>
<p> Now, just log back in to your new phone, and synced contacts should be there. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Import contacts </p>
<p> And finally, if you don’t keep your contacts in your Google Account, but prefer SIM or microSD card, you’ll have to import your contacts first, before being able to access them. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Open the Contacts app. </p>
<p> Tap the three-tabbed button and go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Import and choose the source of your contacts. </p>
<p> Wait a couple of minutes for contacts to sync. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope that at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the problem and that you can access and see all your contacts once again. </p>
<p> If you have any comments, suggestions, or additional questions, just let us know in the comments down below. </p>
<p> 7 COMMENTS </p>
<p> The Google Android Contacts App will not open your Google contact for editing, if the notes you saved online to your contact using your PC have to many characters (too long). Use your PC to edit your Google contact online and reduce the number of notes you have in the notes field. Once reduced, you will be able to edit your contact using your Google Contact Android App on your cellular device. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/cant-send-sms-messages-android" parent_folder="web1" id="file17845310" filename="cant-send-sms-messages-android">
<p> Fix: Can’t send SMS messages in Android </p>
<p> With the rise of the omnipotent instant messengers and VoIP services, the SMS and MMS fell behind. However, SMS is still quite reliable when it comes to simple text messaging. </p>
<p> Issues-wise, you don’t depend on a connection so it does its simple job quite efficiently. Nonetheless, some issues appear occasionally, as there’s a fair number of reports about users who weren’t able to send SMS messages on Android. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear apps cache and try with the Airplane mode </p>
<p> Let’s start with the common troubleshooting when SMS messages won’t send or can’t be received, for some reason. The first step is to simply restart your device. </p>
<p> The second requires enabling and disabling Airplane mode in quick succession. That fixed the temporary stall for some users. </p>
<p> The third step is clearing the cached data the messaging app accumulated over time. If you’re using a third-party app for SMS messaging, you might as well reinstall it. </p>
<p> If we’re referring to a stock SMS app, follow these steps to clear its cache: </p>
<p> Tap Apps (Application Manager). </p>
<p> Open the Messages app. </p>
<p> Choose Storage. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Reset SMS settings to default values </p>
<p> Every service provider has a specific and unique set of options which allows users to freely send SMS and MMS messages. These settings are usually administered automatically, as soon you put the SIM card in a dedicated tray. </p>
<p> However, they might change after a SIM card replacement or a system update. In that case, the SMS messages might just stop deploying in both incoming and outgoing messages. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reset SMS settings to default values on Android: </p>
<p> Open Messages. </p>
<p> Choose Settings. </p>
<p> Reset all settings to factory values. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Change the Mobile Message Center Number </p>
<p> Lots of affected users resolved the issue by replacing the Mobile Message Center Number with alternative values. These numbers are related to individual service providers, so we suggest googling your provider and confirming the MMCN. </p>
<p> After you’ve acquired the number, follow these steps to set it in SMS settings: </p>
<p> Open Messaging app. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-line (or 3-dot menu). </p>
<p> Choose Message Center and change the number. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reset Network settings </p>
<p> Resetting Network settings might help as well. All kinds of things can go wrong, especially if you’re combining SMS and MMS messages. </p>
<p> To reset Network Settings on Android, follow the steps we enlisted below: </p>
<p> Tap System. </p>
<p> Choose Reset options. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Check the SIM card </p>
<p> We covered most of the software-based troubleshooting steps. And the problem might be due to a hardware — poorly placed SIM card might prevent both calls and SMS messages. </p>
<p> Open the SIM card tray and look whether the SIM card is firmly in its predicted position. After that, reset your device and look for changes. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Try another messaging app </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps helped you, we suggest contacting the support. Also, since we can’t be completely certain about the in-app issues (almost every major OEM adds its own SMS app), we can suggest trying a third-party app. </p>
<p> You can find those with ease in the Store, and the Google Messages should be a good choice. Also, the provided solutions only apply to non-rooted devices. If you’ve rooted your phone and the SMS messages just stopped working, flashing it and installing a factory ROM looks like a proper solution. </p>
<p> Either way, these were our solutions. Don’t forget to tell us in the comments section if they were helpful. Also, feel free to tell us about your solutions in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/change-clock-format-on-samsung-s8-lock-screen" parent_folder="web1" id="file17842957" filename="change-clock-format-on-samsung-s8-lock-screen">
<p> Tip: How to change stack up clock format on Samsung Galaxy S8 lock screen </p>
<p> Just as everyone expected, Samsung Galaxy S8 took the market by the storm. It’s extremely well designed and produced, with the plethora of amazing novelties and great software to complete the picture. But, as some would say, the devil is in details. </p>
<p> One detail that somewhat corrupted the overall experience is the positioning of the lock screen clock. Namely, it seems that, by default, the numbers layout is stacked up, minutes above hours. That layout isn’t what most users are used to and they want to change it to standard form. But, as the case has shown, that’s harder to do than we expected. Don’t mix up the Always On Display with the lock screen, though. In Always on Display feature, you can customize the clock to your liking. The Lock screen is a completely different story. </p>
<p> Either way, we prepared some alternatives, or rather workarounds that should help you change the clock’s layout. At least, for the time being. If you’re not satisfied with the digital clock format on your Samsung Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus, make sure to check them out below. </p>
<p> Use different theme </p>
<p> Some users managed to get rid of the unusual clock by replacing the default theme for an alternative. This, of course, isn’t a solution but rather a workaround that might not be suiting everyone’s taste. However, for the time being, there are not so many things you can do, so it’s worth a try. There are some paid themes, but, since we can’t be sure that, after certain steps, the stack up format won’t return, it’s not advised to spend your money on those. </p>
<p> On the other hand, you can use a free theme and make your clock take a normal position that way. Follow the instructions below to do so: </p>
<p> Open Wallpapers and themes. </p>
<p> Tap Themes in the bottom. </p>
<p> Search for Simple Line Black theme. </p>
<p> Moreover, if you’re not liking icon and background changes, you can always choose other wallpaper and restore icons to default. Make sure to check the steps below in order to change the wallpaper on both Home and Lock screen and restore default icons. </p>
<p> Navigate to Gallery and choose the preferred photo individually for Home or Lock screen. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Set as wallpaper. </p>
<p> Now, navigate to Settings. </p>
<p> Open Wallpapers and themes. </p>
<p> Choose Icons. </p>
<p> Tap Default and apply changes. </p>
<p> Try an app that sticks notifications the on lock screen </p>
<p> On the other hand, most of the users are already satisfied with the pre-installed theme and all they want to change is that silly annoyance of the lock screen clock. Or rather, make it vertical like on all Android-powered devices. But, until Samsung fix this and provide users with an option to choose the clock looks (just like in Always on Display features), there’s one, so to say, loophole you can take advantage of. Namely, if Lock screen notifications are enabled, you can place something like weather app to stick on the screen. </p>
<p> Due to its position, the clock changes its format to standard vertical positioning. If that works for you, it’s quite easy to set it up. In the example below, we’ll be using a weather app, called 1Weather. It’s small and subtle but will change your clock to a vertical position. </p>
<p> Enable Notifications. </p>
<p> As long as the notification stays on the Lock Screen, the annoying row-like position should be out of the picture. </p>
<p> That’s it. Since there are so many users that are complaining about this, we can expect that Samsung will do something in the upcoming period. Some of the future updates should change the clock to more natural state. Until then, you can use the above-mentioned workarounds. </p>
<p> In case you have questions or suggestions, make sure to post them in the comments section down below. </p>
<p> Same problem here.. don’t know if this is a Samsung or Android problem but they need to fix it.. every time there’s an os update something gets screwed up </p>

<p> I just restarted my phone and when it booted up a message said IMS stopped. I tapped on it and the clock left the ‘stacked’ position and came up normal. Have no idea what that means. </p>

<p> How to change passcode from 6 to 4 digits on iPhone </p>
<p> Any kind of security is better than no security at all. And that goes for all devices you use, that can somehow, get in the unwanted hands. But, at the same time, we don’t want lengthy passwords that are easily forgettable. </p>
<p> The latest models that support fingerprint scanner are great because, besides protecting your device, you can access it in a blink. However, if your iPhone doesn’t pack a scanner, the passcode is your best replacement. Additionally, the one with the 4 digits should do just fine for temporary protection from curious eyes. The standard passcode is 6 digits long and today we’ll show you how to change it to 4 in few simple steps. </p>
<p> Changing the passcode from 6 to 4 digits in iOS 10 </p>
<p> Here’s exactly what you need to do to change the passcode from 6 to 4 digits on your iPhone: </p>
<p> Choose Change Passcode. </p>
<p> Tap Passcode Options. </p>
<p> And that should do it. Besides that, you can change the what apps are allowed when the screen is locked. That is a great feature in case you want to see notifications or command Siri. </p>
<p> One thing worth mentioning is that occasionally, your carrier or company may install mandatory security settings on your business phone that you can’t change. For example, some of them may demand a 6-digits passcode for improved security. You can surpass that by changing your account email to a personal, private one. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/chrome-needs-storage-access" parent_folder="web1" id="file17848825" filename="chrome-needs-storage-access">
<p> Fix: “Chrome needs storage access” error on Android </p>
<p> Downloading files on Chrome for Android should be a walk in the park. Just grant the Storage permission, select the default folder, and get what you need. It seems that it’s not all that easy for some users who reported constant prompts that Chrome needs storage access whenever they try to download something. </p>
<p> How do I give Chrome storage access? </p>
<p> You can easily give storage access to Chrome from the Settings > Apps > Chrome > Permissions. However, it seems that we are looking at the bug so, in case the first step below doesn’t help, continue through the list in order to resolve the problem. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Grant Storage permission to Chrome </p>
<p> Let’s start with the obvious solution. Google Chrome will, of course, ask for the Storage permission in order to download and store files locally. Now, we understand that Storage permission is already granted, but it won’t cost you anything to check it out again. </p>
<p> Here’s how to give Chrome storage access (permission to store and access files locally): </p>
<p> Select All apps, App Manager, or Manage apps. </p>
<p> Open Chrome. </p>
<p> If there are additional permissions including storage, make sure to grant them to Chrome, too. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear Chrome’s cache and data </p>
<p> Moving on. If the issue persists and Chrome is repeatedly asking for the storage access you already granted, we suggest clearing the app’s cache and data. This way, you’ll reset the app and, hopefully, resolve the issue at hand. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to clear cache and data from Chrome: </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reinstall Chrome </p>
<p> You can also try and reinstall Chrome for Android. That way you’ll get the latest version of the app. Some users who reported this error were on the Beta Android version so the problem might be in the discrepancy between the OS and Chrome version that’s, at the moment, unoptimized. </p>
<p> First of all, make sure that you are not on the Beta version of Android or, if you are, consider using an alternative browser. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reinstall Chrome via the Play Store: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for and expand Google Chrome. </p>
<p> Uninstall Google Chrome (this will uninstall updates if Chrome is a system app). </p>
<p> Update or reinstall Chrome. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check storage space and change download folder </p>
<p> Of course, it goes without saying that you need enough storage space in order to download and store files locally. Make sure to have enough space first and then you can also try to change the download folder. The folder is usually stuck in the Android > Data root, but you can try and change it for the SD card for the sake of troubleshooting. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change the Download folder for Google Chrome on Android: </p>
<p> Open Chrome. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and open Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll down and open Downloads. </p>
<p> Tap on the Download location and select external storage. </p>
<p> Give it a go and then switch back to internal storage and try downloading files again. </p>
<p> Alternatively, open File Manager (any file manager should do) and navigate to Internal Storage > Android > data > com.android.chrome > files and delete the Download folder. Try downloading files again. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Inspect your SD card </p>
<p> Now, even if you already allowed Chrome to access your Storage, due to certain permission limitations, this doesn’t always apply to external storage. For that, you might need to change secondary permissions or allow access to SD once prompted. </p>
<p> The secondary permissions are available only on Android 10. Android 9 Pie will just ask for permission once you try to download files to the SD card. </p>
<p> Of course, make sure that your SD card is mounted and in working order. If not, you can format it and give it another try. Just don’t forget to back up your files prior to erasing the contents of the external storage. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Update the firmware </p>
<p> We already mentioned the discrepancy between Chrome and the OS. In order to avoid issues with both pre-installed apps (most Google apps come pre-installed) or third-party apps, we suggest keeping your system up to date. </p>
<p> So, make sure to download and install Android updates, if available. That should address the issue with the Chrome needs storage access error. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Rollback to an older version of Chrome </p>
<p> Finally, you can rollback Chrome by installing an older version of it via an APK. As you are probably aware, the Play Store offers only the latest public (or Beta) versions of a certain app. </p>
<p> In order to get an older version of an app, you’ll need to uninstall the current version and then download and install an APK. Android Package Kit file which is the default format of Android apps. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to download and install an older version of Chrome: </p>
<p> Uninstall Google Chrome. </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror, here, or any other APK hub online. </p>
<p> Download an older APK version but not older than two months. </p>
<p> Grant permission to install apps from untrusted sources. </p>
<p> Install the APK and give it a go. </p>
<p> You can, of course, if the Chrome needs storage access error occurs again, reset your device to factory settings. Although, we are not sure the problem is worth a hassle. </p>
<p> With that said, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and make sure to share your questions or alternative solutions in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/chrome-stops-working-after-android-update" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844270" filename="chrome-stops-working-after-android-update">
<p> Chrome not working after latest Android update </p>
<p> There are two types of people in this world: those who love and fully enjoy Chrome and those who don’t. Now, it’s normal for the largest search engine to have a most used web-browser out there. And, if you’re an Android user, you’re most likely ”stuck” with this browser since it comes as a pre-installed feature. </p>
<p> Now, we personally enjoy Chrome. There are some privacy and resource-hogging claims against Chrome, but, all in all, this is an exquisite browser. One that functions as intended. Namely, after recent Android updates, users reported several issues regarding Chrome. For some of them, the app is frequently crashing, while others have had different but still serious issues with Google’s native browser. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we conducted a research and enlisted possible workarounds that should help you overcome these issues. If you have had any problems regarding the Chrome behavior, make sure to check the list below. </p>
<p> Clear app’s cache and data </p>
<p> It doesn’t matter if we’re referring to a 3rd-party app or, in this case, the pre-installed one. Both are collecting data and cache in order to speed up and facilitate usage. However, after some time, the piles of data and cache can corrupt the app and, consequently, that may lead to issues. Chrome for Android is known for great performance, well-designed and utilized interface, and integration with other Google’s essential apps. Nonetheless, it’s also known for resource hogging and frequent issues that occur for various reasons. </p>
<p> In order to address those, let’s move to clearing apps cache and data, respectively: </p>
<p> Tap Chrome. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> Have in mind that this will wipe browsing history, including bookmarks, accounts, saved settings, and locally stored data. </p>
<p> Update Chrome </p>
<p> Another viable solution is updating. Due to frequent OS changes or changes of some other related apps, Chrome might suffer. So, in order for everything to function as intended, you’ll need the latest version of Chrome installed. Some users have had issues with updating of the app within a Play Store, but that’s rather a rare occurrence. So, what you need to do is as simple as it sounds: just navigate to Play Store and update Chrome. </p>
<p> If you’re uncertain how to do it, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Tap Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for Chrome. </p>
<p> If there is an update available, make sure to install it. </p>
<p> Restart your device and give it another try. </p>
<p> If, even the latest Chrome version is crashing or you’re experiencing similar issues, make sure to check the steps below. </p>
<p> Boot in Safe mode </p>
<p> As you probably know, since Chrome is a built-in, default browser, certain 3rd-party apps might use it to access links. For example, if you open a link on Facebook app, there’s a great chance that this link will get opened with Chrome. Now, that’s just a normal multi-app usage on any Android device. However, some apps with ads or similar content might affect the Chrome behavior. It’s not a secret that specific ads are not exactly malware-free, so it’s your best bet to disable them. Once we take the lack of optimization into play, there’s a chance that two apps are not functioning well on the latest Android iteration. </p>
<p> But, how to know which app is the culprit for this unpleasant issue? The best way to do so is to boot your device into Safe Mode. This is a primary troubleshooting procedure and it’s very helpful in this or similar scenarios. </p>
<p> Since the procedure differs for various devices, we advise you to google it and find the exact steps for your handset. </p>
<p> Wipe Cache Data </p>
<p> Besides the storage partition that, simply put, collects all data on your device, the cache partition stores only cache. The main role of the system cache is to speed up the related system processes so they won’t need to load again every time you restart the device. However, due to various reasons, cache partition can get corrupted. Especially right after the OS update. </p>
<p> In order to address the potential corruption that emerged after an update, follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Make sure your device’s battery is at least at 20 or so per cent. </p>
<p> Turn Off the device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key + Power button. </p>
<p> Keep on holding the Volume Down key until the Boot Menu appears. </p>
<p> By using Volume keys (up and down), navigate through the menu until you reach Recovery mode. </p>
<p> Use the Power button to select Recovery Mode. </p>
<p> The phone should restart now and you should see the Android mascot with an exclamation mark. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and, while holding it, press Volume Up key once. </p>
<p> Release the Power button and you should see the Recovery Mode menu. </p>
<p> Again, use Volume keys to navigate through the menu until you reach Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Press the Power button once to confirm it. </p>
<p> If asked, confirm the action. </p>
<p> Your device will restart and you should be good to go. </p>
<p> Have in mind that the procedure might not be the same for all devices. So, make sure to accordingly look up for the exact instructions that apply to your handset. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset </p>
<p> Finally, if you’re unable to deal with the Chrome issues by using the previous steps, the final place is reserved for the factory reset. Usually, if the problem goes as deep as this, a factory reset should be helpful. Even though it’s not the preferred solution, solely because the fact that you’ll lose all data and it’s time-consuming, it should clean up the possible corruption that emerged after the OS update. Don’t forget to backup your data to Google Drive and Photos, or, alternatively, to your PC. </p>
<p> Follow the steps below to restore your system to factory settings: </p>
<p> Tap Settings </p>
<p> Select Backup & reset </p>
<p> Tap Factory data reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset phone to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Moreover, as you’re probably aware, you can use specific PC suite provided by a manufacturer. Those have special tools that should speed up both resetting and restoring process. They’re free to obtain and you can find them on official sites. However, we strongly advise you to use exclusively trusted applications, because some of the 3rd-party solutions are not secure. </p>
<p> Use an alternative browser </p>
<p> Finally, if you’re disappointed with the latest update and changes that inflicted upon your default browser, there are so many alternatives to use for the time being. Until the Google sort things out, you can use a large variety of browsers available in the Play Store. Starting with old and trusty Firefox or Opera, and going to less known but still great alternatives. </p>
<p> Maybe they grow on you, or in case they don’t, you can use them temporarily until the further updates resolve the issue at hand. Also, don’t forget to completely disable Chrome and change the default browser settings. That way, it will be there but it won’t bother you anymore. </p>
<p> That should do it. We hope that this was helpful and that you’ll manage to get things work by following some of the above-mentioned steps. Also, don’t forget to share with us your questions, suggestions or alternative solutions. We’re always glad to see your feedback in the comments section below. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> I have no idea what in God’s name is happening. I had reset my phone about a month ago. Now that I’m trying to update my apps, Chrome and some few other apps from Google are not updating. All process is fine, I went to playstore, but the update button, it showed downloading meter thing, and said installing update. But after a few seconds it says this app couldn’t update. YouTube, maps etc are updated, but Chrome isn’t updating. </p>
<p> I tried clearing cache, uninstalling updates and then installing again, but nothing worked. </p>

<p> Fix: Clash of Clans crashes in iOS </p>
<p> It was just the question of time before the multiplayer games that took over the PC world will take over the handheld devices. And for a reason. There’s nothing like competitiveness and the sheer joy of defeating someone’s army or clan in the fair and square encounter. And the main pretender on the MMO throne in the handheld category is Clash of Clans. </p>
<p> This amazing freemium game is already vastly popular and it grouped substantial player base, both on Android and iOS. However, as the case already showed on multiple occasions, there’s no software of any kind without its issues. Especially when it comes to connection-dependent complex games. </p>
<p> One of the most common issues is related to frequent crashes or failed loading. For that purpose, we prepared a list of some formidable solutions that should help you out substantially. Make sure to check them out below. </p>
<p> Check the requirements </p>
<p> First of all, make sure that your device is supported and that it’s not jailbroken. Jailbroken devices in combination with most similar games are somewhat a gamble. It may work, but likewise, it may not. So, if you’re keen to play this game in a seamless manner, make sure that you have iOS 5.1.1 or later. If you’re meeting those requirements, let’s move to troubleshooting. </p>
<p> Check the connection </p>
<p> A faulty or unstable connection may cause crashes on Clash of clans and similar games. Namely, as you’re probably aware, without the stable connection, this game is basically unplayable. And, sadly, some code error may get you back to a home screen before you even know it. So, these are some of the connection-related steps you can take to prevent that: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Reset the Network settings. </p>
<p> Make sure that the 9339 port is open. Check it here. </p>
<p> Use exclusively stable Wi-Fi to play the game rather than mobile data. </p>
<p> Make sure that the Wi-Fi connection is stable. Public Wi-Fi is not always suitable for Arena matches. </p>
<p> Relaunch the app and restart your device </p>
<p> Another obvious step is to exit the game, restart the device, and start the game again. On some occasions, while loading the base, a certain glitch can cause the app to fail. Sometimes it will start again and load the in-game surroundings, on other, it will freeze until it crashes eventually. So, make sure to close the app, restart your device, and start it again after the power is on. </p>
<p> While in game, press Home button twice. </p>
<p> Hold until the Close sign appears. </p>
<p> Restart your device by holding the Power button. </p>
<p> If the app behavior is still driving you mad, move on to additional steps. </p>
<p> Update the app </p>
<p> Too many times we witnessed consequences of bad updates that, instead of improving, break our favorite app or game. Even though it’s highly advised to always check for updates, they too often downgrade an overall in-game experience. But, with the responsible developers, like SuperCell, there’s a great chance that the update will, eventually, fix issues reported by the community. So, make sure to update the app, and hopefully, your problems will be gone so you can get hold on your in-game opponents. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to check for update in Apple Store: </p>
<p> Tap App Store. </p>
<p> Open Updates. </p>
<p> If there are updates available for Clash of Clans, tap to update it. </p>
<p> If the latest version bears the same reoccurring issues, make sure to take the additional steps. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app </p>
<p> It’s hard to find a list that addresses similar issues without a reinstallation step. The same goes for the Clash of Clans. While playing, the game is constantly changing and it’s way of functioning within iOS. So, some sort of corruption isn’t excluded. And for those, the best medicine is to start from a scratch. Since your game data is connected with your account, you won’t lose game progress or achievements. </p>
<p> This is how to reinstall Clash of Clans: </p>
<p> On the app screen, tap and hold the Clash of Clans app until the X appears. </p>
<p> Tap X to uninstall the app. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Open App Store and search for Clash of clans. </p>
<p> Tap and install the app. </p>
<p> That should resolve any app-related issues. But, it’s not always the game that’s the culprit for the crashes. </p>
<p> Check your storage space </p>
<p> As you’re probably aware, every app stores a lot of individual data that’s related to it’s functioning and improved accessibility, mostly temporary and update files. However, we all know how iOS-powered handsets have a tendency to suffer from a lack of space, especially the older devices that were presented with the limited internal storage. </p>
<p> So, another thing that can cause crashes is the inability of the game to store additional data on your device. What you should do is to make sure that there’s enough storage space. So, navigate to Settings > General > Usage to find the space-consuming apps and files. Additionally, if you’ve backed up your photos/videos, you can delete them from the internal storage in order to make space for all system inhabitants to work without issues. </p>
<p> Logout/login to Facebook or Game center </p>
<p> As you know, there are two ways you can log in in Clash of clans. First is with the iOS-native Game center, other is trough the omnipresent social network, Facebook. And both of them are known for triggering some in-game issues. Since you can’t be certain which of those two is the instigator, make sure to log out of both of them and then log in again. </p>
<p> This can help you a lot with the loading problems, especially when switching in-game accounts. </p>
<p> Update iOS </p>
<p> People too often diminish the importance of timely updated OS. We’re not saying that those too often come with the multitude of issues, but there’s one thing you should have in mind. Most of the games/apps are optimized for the latest system version, or at least, they’ll be in some time soon. </p>
<p> So, in order to maintain overall app stability, it’s advised to update your system frequently. Most of the time, this is done automatically but it won’t hurt to check for the updates on your own. And this is how to do it in a few simple steps: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open General. </p>
<p> Tap Software update. </p>
<p> If there are some updates available, you can choose to install them right now or later. </p>
<p> Don’t forget that you can use the iTunes client for updates, too. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings </p>
<p> Not many users are ready to give up their custom settings and reset factory settings, we’re aware of that. However, if the game is functioning well for so many players and you have this distinctive issue with crashes, chances are that your device the is the core of the problem. So, backup your data and move on to factory reset. Of course, if all of the previous steps fell short. </p>
<p> This is how to restore factory settings on an iOS device: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose General. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Select Erase All Content and Settings. </p>
<p> Have in mind that all of your data will be gone, so be sure to back it up before performing the reset. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and start the process. </p>
<p> Later on, you should choose Restore from the iCloud Backup feature, and retrieve your data. </p>
<p> This should do it. In case you have any questions related to this or some other similar apps, don’t hesitate to ask. Moreover, any alternative solutions are welcomed, too. </p>

<p> How to clear Cache data in Android 10 </p>
<p> Another version of Android, another article about clearing cache. Writing this guide has become a tradition on our site, mainly because users aren’t thrilled with the way the latest versions of Android handle the caching process. More precisely, how you clear that cache. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, nothing has changed in Android 10 compared to Android 9 Pie. The process is identical, and not a bit less annoying. So, I didn’t even have to write this article, because everything is mentioned in the previous one. But I did it anyway, mainly to cover the keyword and draw some more visits (don’t tell Google :wink:). </p>
<p> Anyway, if you want to know more about how caching works in Android, refer to the mentioned article. Here I’ll cut to the chase, and just show you how to clear cache in Android 10. And you’re not going to like it. </p>
<p> Clear cache individually </p>
<p> Long gone are the days when you could just hop into Settings and clear the accumulated cache of all the apps on your smartphone with just a few taps. Now, you have to clear cache for each app individually. </p>
<p> Tap See all (x) apps </p>
<p> Now, tap the app to get its App info. </p>
<p> The procedure may vary depending on your smartphone manufacturer or whether you’re using a custom ROM or stock Android. For example, Samsung users can access the app list through the Device Care section in Settings. </p>
<p> Should you use a “performance-boosting” app? </p>
<p> You shouldn’t. I’m just going to say it, most of those glorified cleaners, performance-boosters, system-enhancers are gimmicks. These apps do nothing you can’t do by yourself with just a few taps in Settings. On top of that, these “performance-boosters” are real data harvesters, and you’re basically giving them access to every bit of your personal info by agreeing to run them on your phone. </p>
<p> Google recognizes that to some degree. That’s why the revamped permissions system in Android 10 serves as the first line of defense against data-collecting apps that careless users usually install. </p>
<p> So, even if you want to use a third-party app to clear the accumulated cache, the system simply won’t allow it. And it’s for the best. </p>
<p> Don’t get me wrong, there are some legitimate apps like Files by Google that can help you organize your storage better, but even this app doesn’t have the power to perform tasks like clearing all cache at once. Plus you don’t have to worry about your data being collected because, well, Google already has it. </p>
<p> That’s about it. What do you think about this whole cache clearing mess in Android? Would you like to have the old method back? Let us know in the comments below. </p>
<p> Attn: Ivan Jenic — Thank you for writing this article BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO REWRITE IT. Your info is inaccurate. My Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ with Android 10 does NOT have a Settings menu item called ‘Apps & Notifications’: it simply has the item called ‘Apps’. Also, ‘clear data’ & ‘clear cache’ are not located exactly where your article claims. BUT hey, Samsung’s Android variant is always a slightly different breed. </p>

<p> The way this whole article was written sums up my frustration with this new process. In Android 9, I was able to just visit “device care” and tap “clear cache.” That actually worked. I’m not sure why they downgraded. Probably to get more uninformed users to think they need a new phone if the looming cache starts taking over storage and bugs up the phone when it’s near full. </p>

<p> How to clear Cache data in Android Oreo </p>
<p> Android Oreo has changed the way we clear cached data on our phones! Which left some users confused, as the process isn’t as straightforward and simple as it used to be in Android Nougat. </p>
<p> In Android Nougat, you could simply go to Storage settings, and bulk clear all the cache on your phone. That’s very practical, because users don’t have to bother clearing each app’s cache individually. A time-saving feature, we must say. </p>
<p> But that’s not the case anymore. When you go to Storage settings in Android Oreo, you won’t see this option anymore. That’s because Google decided to remove the traditional cache-clearing fature from Oreo. </p>
<p> So, how do we actually clear cache in Android Oreo now? </p>
<p> How is cached data cleared in Android Oreo </p>
<p> To understand what’s going on, we’ll have to include the whole picture. With Android O, Google wants to change the whole policy of using, storing, and clearing cached data. Google encourages developers to be more ‘efficient’ in developing their apps. </p>
<p> Here’s what the Android O developer preview release notes say: </p>
<p> “Android O gives better guidance and behaviors around cached data. Each app is now given a disk space quota for cached data…. </p>
<p> When the system needs to free up disk space, it will start by deleting cached files from apps that are the most over their allocated quota. Thus, if you [the developer of an app] keep your cached data under your allocated quota, your cached files will be some of the last on the system to be cleared when necessary. When the system is deciding what cached files to delete inside your app, it will consider the oldest files first (as determined by modified time).” </p>
<p> Of course, this is for the developer preview. But as it appears, nothing has changed in the official version. </p>
<p> So, long story short. You don’t need to clear cached data at all, as the system should do that for you. Because of that, there’s no cache partition, which will put all cached data in one place. </p>
<p> In theory, this looks pretty good, because the system should do all the work for you, when there’s need to free up disk space. But in practice, it might not function as flawless as Google imagines it. </p>
<p> Developers will need to change the code in their apps, and deliver proper updates to you. So, some time might pass until all your apps get updated, and that can cause troubles for your phone to properly manage the storage. We can only hope developers will deliver needed updates as soon as possible. </p>
<p> Clear cache for each app individually </p>
<p> Although the option to bulk clear your cached data on your phone is missing, you can still clear cache for each app individually, if you really want. And here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Storage </p>
<p> Navigate to Other apps </p>
<p> Now, tap on the app you want to clear cache for </p>
<p> Tap on Clear Cache </p>
<p> Use a third party app </p>
<p> Additionally, if you really want to buck clear cache on your Android phone, you can always use some third-party app. Some of the most popular apps for these purposes are CCleaner and Clean Master. But be careful, because some apps might actually slow down your device, or remove something you don’t want to be removed. So, just think about if it’s worth installing a third-party app for something your system would do on its own anyway. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope you understand the whole cache clearing philosophy better now. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, let me know in the comments, or reach me out on twitter. </p>

<p> There’s still a way to clear cache all at once, in recovery mode. Which is the way I prefer to do so as it formats your cache memory (cleaner slate). For instance, for my Moto Z2 play, I power down the phone, then I hit the power & volume down button simultaneously and hold it for like 2 seconds. This brings me to a boot option screen, I then use the volume keys to scroll to “Recovery Mode” and use the power button to select. After the little green android robot shows onto the center of the screen laying down… Read more » </p>

<p> I’ve been wondering for sometime why I couldn’t clear the cache in bulk for my installed apps and now I know the reason. I’m not a fan of cleaner apps, they do more harm than good so I’m just clearing the cache of each app individually, even though it’s more time consuming then before. Why do Google insist on making things more difficult by taking away useful features like being able to clear the cache with just one tap? It looks like being able to check my battery temperature has gone too so I’ve had to install an app to… Read more » </p>

<p> iOS 13.5.1 issues: Battery drain, Bluetooth problems, and more </p>
<p> Apple recently released the latest iOS 13.5.1 update. The update is available to users of all compatible iPhone Models. Unlike the previous update, this one doesn’t bring any new features but instead focuses on improving the overall security of the OS. </p>
<p> Although Apple’s update release notes aren’t very clear on what exactly the new update does, it does state that the update addresses the vulnerability exploited by the uncover jailbreak. With that being said, most jailbreakers would want to avoid this update. The rest of the users can comfortably install this release, and they won’t notice any difference in the way their iPhone works. </p>
<p> Or will they? </p>
<p> Although the new update brings zero new features, it actually causes some problems to users who installed it. Users are reporting battery drains, Bluetooth issues, connectivity problems, and more. </p>
<p> However, none of the problems seems to be widespread, as these are the individually reported cases. You have better chances of installing the update without any problems, than being stuck with an annoying issue. Nevertheless, I’m going to list some of the reported problems here, so you can see what could potentially go wrong. </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 battery drain </p>
<p> Reports about the battery drain caused by iOS 13.5.1 have been circulating on Twitter since the update’s release. Here’s one of the complaints: </p>
<p> @AppleSupport iphone battery draining like crazy after upgrading to iOS 13.5.1. What’s going on? Is there a fix?? </p>
<p> Right now, the solution to this problem is unknown. It appears that users experiencing the battery drain issue will have to wait for Apple to release a follow-up update. </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> Although reported by the smaller number of users, it appears that Bluetooth also doesn’t work for some people who installed iOS 13.5.1. </p>
<p> @Apple my phones Bluetooth just won’t connect to any device even though it’s turned on and discoverable? Any ideas </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 Face ID issues </p>
<p> Although iOS 13.5 improved Face ID to make it work with face masks, some people apparently have problems with it stretching to iOS 13.5.1. </p>
<p> @AppleSupport Why my face id isn’t working? I just updated to ios 13.5.1 and now it’s keep telling me that face id is not available! Can you help me? </p>
<p> Other problems </p>
<p> Besides the above-mentioned issues that appear to be more common, there are also a few more problems, including a camera problem, weird charging (though this one wasn’t specified, so I can’t tell you whether it was indeed caused by iOS 13.5.1, and a SIM card issue where the phone shows SIM cards as invalid. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, there are no confirmed solutions to any of these problems. Apple support usually recommends generic solutions to particular problems, by I doubt any of those will be helpful. Users that were hit by the update will probably have to wait for a patch. </p>
<p> Have you experienced any issues after installing iOS 13.5.1? If so, feel free to share them with us in the comments below. </p>

<p> Hello everyone! Thanks for sharing your issues with us. If you don’t mind, I’ll update the article and list your problems. I’ll do the same if I find any solutions. Hope everything will get back to normal soon! </p>
<p> Please if you have any info on an update or solution let us know. Also, what is your opinion on going back to older iOS, even if it loses data, would it fix the battery drain and overheating (which is scary – phone feels it’s about to go up in flames)? </p>

<p> i have huge battery drain now on 13.5.1. Have to charge twice a day minimum, and sometimes 3 times if I use my phone in just a normal way. </p>
<p> my Iphone x drains 20% every hour at 86% battery health. I resetted it deleting all data. No apps are installed and still 20% battery every hour on airplane mode </p>

<p> My ipone SE will connect to bluetooth devices however they do no show up on the connected devices list. And it appears that it continues to search for them. I tried all the fixes showing up on the various web pages, but none fix the problem. </p>

<p> I used to charge my phone once a night, right before bed. I’m now having to plug in my phone three to four times a day after using my phone for things that aren’t taking up a lot of resources at all. On top of that, my phone has been getting hot to the touch while doing things like scrolling through the internet. My iPhone 11 used to have insane battery life , and this is frustrating. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Poco X2 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> After 2 years, Xiaomi’s subsidiary, Poco, introduced the successor to groundbreaking Pocophone F1. Now, we can’t say with certainty whether this is a direct successor, since the Poco X2, seemingly, focuses on the screen refresh rate more than super-affordable hardware. But it’s far from being a one-trick pony. Today, we invested some time in learning about the Poco X2 and brought you the list of common issues. </p>
<p> If you have experienced any issues on the Poco X2, make sure to check our list because we have some recommended solutions, as well. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Missing Refresh rate and NFC options </p>
<p> The Poco X2 and the Redmi K30 (4G version) are literally the same devices. The only two differences are print on the back and MIUI ROMs, as the Redmi K30 uses China ROM and the Poco X2 comes with the Poco version of the Global MIUI 11. That’s it. </p>
<p> That is possibly the reason why some Poco X2 users are unable to locate NFC and Screen Refresh rate settings. To utilize Google’s services, you’ll need to flash the Global ROM on your device. We recommend unlocking the bootloader and flashing the Global ROM or, you might choose, Xiaomi EU ROM which is toned-down MIUI without ads. </p>
<p> 2. Google Play in-app purchases don’t work </p>
<p> Another problem related to the ROM you are running. Google Play purchases probably won’t work on Chinese ROM so make sure to run the official Global ROM before trying to purchase anything from the Store. </p>
<p> If you are certain that your ROM is Global and your device is not rooted, make sure to clear cache and data from the Play Store, check your credentials or, eventually, reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 3. How to download and install Gcam on Poco X2 </p>
<p> The camera setup on the Poco X2 is quite amazing, considering the pricing of the device. The good thing about being the twin brother of the Redmi K30 lies in the bigger support from independent developers. So, any Gcam port that works on the Redmi K30, should work on the Poco X2. And vice versa. As they are basically the same device. </p>
<p> But should you get the Gcam and use it over the stock Camera app? Based on reports: definitely. The white balance and overall color science are not strong sides of Xiaomi (and its subsidiaries, Poco and Redmi). That’s all avoided with the Gcam which brings better image processing and more realistic photography. </p>
<p> If you are not sure how to install Gcam on your Poco X2, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> In Google Chrome on your handset, navigate to the Gcam Hub, here, and download one of the versions by tapping on it. </p>
<p> Allow installation of apps from third-party sources when prompted. </p>
<p> You can download the configuration files and add them by following the instructions provided, here. The configuration for this device can be found within the Redmi K30, on this list. </p>
<p> Install Gcam and that’s it. You can tweak some options in Settings to your liking. Enjoy. </p>
<p> 4. Battery drain issue </p>
<p> The 120Hz refresh rate and the 6.6 inches LCD display are massive reasons why this device takes a lot of juice. However, that’s covered with the large 4500 mAh battery that supports the 27W fast charging. On the other hand, it doesn’t come as a surprise that some users noticed a significant battery drain. This Poco X2 issue is especially prominent after updates. </p>
<p> Now, there are a few things you can do to reduce the battery drain, and we made sure to list them below: </p>
<p> Disable Automatic brightness and set the brightness manually. </p>
<p> Open Developer options and disable Mobile Data always on. </p>
<p> Prevent some secondary apps from working in the background. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth overnight. </p>
<p> Use Greenify or any other third-party application to limit the background processes. </p>
<p> Update your device or reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 5. Missing notifications </p>
<p> The notifications as a whole were and still are one of the biggest Xiaomi’s omissions on MIUI. The system kills off the apps in the background on its own, notifications disappear from the status bar, vibration doesn’t work with the incoming calls, etc. So many problems and we are not sure why Xiaomi keeps adding new features and completely neglects the essentials. </p>
<p> On the Poco X2 running MIUI 11 (based on Android 10), Xiaomi fixed some of those issues. However, the problem with calls still stands, as the users are not hearing the ringing sound but there’s no prompt of an incoming call on the lock screen. </p>
<p> There are some things you should check to ensure that the issue is not on your side. Here’s what you should do: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Display > Notch & status bar. Toggle ON the “Show icons for incoming notifications” option. </p>
<p> Open Settings > Sound & vibration. Select any default Ringtone. Stick with the system sounds. </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Dialer and clear cache and data. While there, open Notifications and ensure that all notifications are enabled. If you are using a 3rd-party dialer (Google’s Phone or something else), make sure to set do the same. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings > Apps > Manage apps. Tap the 3-dot menu and select Default apps. Once there, select your default Dial app. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6. The Dialer app and keyboard are hanging </p>
<p> Other Poco X2 users reported issues with two stock apps, the Dialer app and the keyboard. Both are, based on reports, hanging and glitching. Those two apps also tend to crash from time to time, although that’s not as common. </p>
<p> The problem is probably related to the latest MIUI release and updating the firmware should address it. On the other hand, you can tackle problems within the app (system or 3rd-party apps) by clearing cache and data. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to troubleshoot issues with Dialer and Keyboard on the Poco X2: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and open Dialer. Clear cache and data from it. Do the same for the Keyboard app. </p>
<p> Get back to Manage apps and tap on the 3-dot menu. Tap Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Switch to a third-party dialer and keyboard until the problem is fixed with updates. </p>
<p> 7. Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Wi-Fi issues are not exactly common but an occasional bug that comes with an update might ruin the user experience. For some users, there’s no internet connection even though they are connected to a network. </p>
<p> Now, in many cases, this might be an MIUI bug, but it’s worth checking everything on your side before casting blame on the performance of the device or the performance of its ROM. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to troubleshoot Wi-Fi issues on the Poco X2: </p>
<p> Reboot your device and router/modem. </p>
<p> Delete the SSID from the list of networks and connect again. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 8. Mobile data not working during calls </p>
<p> This highly depends on your carrier and service provider. Namely, maybe the service is not available on some carriers or there is a problem with the APN configuration. You can tackle the latter by resetting APN settings and making sure that GSM/WCDMA/LTE is your preferred network type. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and NFC. </p>
<p> Reset APN. </p>
<p> If the issue persists, make sure to contact your carrier or service provider and ask for help. </p>
<p> 9. Poor cell reception </p>
<p> On a similar note, some users have a hard time with the cell reception, claiming that the signal is really bad even in the highly-populated areas where it shouldn’t be as half as bad. Not only does this make the call quality much worse, but it also depletes the battery faster. Which isn’t great, considering how much battery drops when the 120Hz refresh rate is enabled. </p>
<p> On the other hand, this device is built for one market so make sure to check the supported bands before acquiring it. </p>
<p> Now, in regards to bad network coverage, we can recommend taking these steps: </p>
<p> Ensure that your SIM card is properly placed. If possible, stick to one SIM card for the time being. </p>
<p> Remove the protective casing. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth and NFC when you are not using them. </p>
<p> Reset APN. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 10. Face unlock not working </p>
<p> All Xiaomi-made devices running MIUI 10 and later, including Redmi and Poco series, have face unlock. Some ROMs will limit them to certain regions but, by switching the region in Settings > Additional settings, you should be able to utilize it. </p>
<p> Now, Face Unlock should work on the Poco X2 from the get-go but, being a novel device, the lack of optimization or a temporary bug might prevent this. </p>
<p> If you are unable to utilize face unlock on the Poco X2, check these steps: </p>
<p> Open Additional settings. Select Region and choose Hong Kong. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Passwords & security > Face unlock. Enter your PIN or password. Tap Delete face data and enroll your face again. Make sure that the Unlock using face data is toggled on. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 11. Screen flickers after unlocking and UI animations lag </p>
<p> To be perfectly honest, the majority of issues we listed here and issues in general, stem from the lack of ROM optimization. Although the Poco X2 comes with the 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touchscreen response, some tweaking is necessary to avoid those minor but visible initial omissions. </p>
<p> Some users have experienced a screen flicker when the device is unlocked, during that short transition from the lock screen (or idle state) to Home Screen. Others have that small but noticeable lag when scrolling, switching between apps, etc. We can agree that this doesn’t go well with the aforementioned enhancements this device has. </p>
<p> Now, we are sure Poco will deal with these issues eventually through updates. But, for the time being, check these steps to reduce flickers and lags on your Poco X2: </p>
<p> Lower animations in Developer options. </p>
<p> Disable live wallpapers on Home and Lock screens. </p>
<p> Stick to the stock launcher. </p>
<p> 12. Common troubleshooting steps for Xiaomi Poco X2 </p>
<p> Tap All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number. </p>
<p> Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options. </p>
<p> Boot the device into Safe Mode </p>
<p> Turn the device off. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and then, once the Xiaomi logo appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down button. </p>
<p> To exit Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Reset the device to Factory Settings </p>
<p> Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> Side note: If you find MIUI too much bloated (too many unnecessary system apps), learn how to debloat it and make it both faster and cleaner while significantly improving battery life. Find our article on the subject with detailed instructions, here. </p>
<p> That’s it. Thank you for reading and we hope this article shed some light on emerging issues that bother Poco X2 users.

<p> My phone is not getting instantly locked. Whenever i press the lock button it gets locked in 5 seconds. There is no option to rectify that. The problem with that is if somebody picks your phone instantly anyone could have an access to your phone. Its very annoying. </p>

<p> Redmi 8A common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Xiaomi has such a variety of devices for all price segments. One of the most interesting devices on the market in the low-budget division must be Redmi 8A. Great affordable entry device for all undemanding users out there. However, as all of them, the Redmi 8A has a variety of bugs and common issues we run into on various forums. </p>
<p> We made sure to list all more prominent issues below, along with applicable solutions. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Slow and laggy performance </p>
<p> With its Snapdragon 439 chipset and up to 4 GB of RAM, the Redmi 8A is quite a regular budget device. It would be unreasonable to expect anything amazing from a device at this price point. Especially from the 2/32 GB variation. However, users reported slow performance and UI lags even with the minimum load, which shouldn’t be the case. </p>
<p> Now, we all know that Xiaomi’s MIUI (Redmi is Xiaomi’s subsidiary FYI) sometimes works flawlessly while other times, due to a lack of proper optimization, it doesn’t hold up to expected standards. </p>
<p> We have a few things you can try to improve the performance of the Redmi 8A. Try with these steps: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > My device > System and check for updates. Install an update if available. </p>
<p> Enable Developer options (Settings > My device > All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number). Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options and disable MIUI Optimization at the bottom. </p>
<p> Get back in Developer options and reduce Animation from 1 to 0.5. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings (the procedure is explained at the bottom of this article). </p>
<p> 2. Redmi 8A overheating </p>
<p> Overheating is never good. If the device is hot over prolonged periods of time, this might lead to fatal hardware damage and render it unusable. It happens rarely but it’s a possibility nonetheless. </p>
<p> Users reported that Redmi 8A is overheating, especially during charging. If that’s the case for you, consider following the steps below: </p>
<p> Remove the protective case. </p>
<p> Don’t use your device while charging. </p>
<p> Turn on Airplane mode while charging. </p>
<p> 3. Battery draining </p>
<p> Having consistent battery longevity is quite hard these days with streaming and gaming and whatnot. One of the selling points of the Redmi 8A is definitely that enormous 5000 mAh Li-Po battery. Big enough to provide users with astonishing 15+ hours of Screen-on Time. </p>
<p> However, some owners of the Redmi 8A reported battery draining fast on the stock MIUI ROM. This is especially prominent after major updates. Follow these instructions to reduce battery draining and increase the SoT on your device: </p>
<p> Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Disable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and individually disable Autostart on apps. </p>
<p> Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery. </p>
<p> 4. Screen freezing and yellow tint issues </p>
<p> Again, for this money, it would be too much to expect miracles in any area, especially the display. However, some things can’t be overlooked, as there are reports about screen misbehaving and having a prominent yellow tint. </p>
<p> It seems that the screen has a yellowish tint with the Original setting in Color Scheme options. What you can do is switch to Auto. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to switch to Auto Color Scheme and resolve issues with the yellow tint on Redmi 8A: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Display. </p>
<p> Select Color Scheme. </p>
<p> Choose Auto instead of the Original setting. </p>
<p> 5. Low speaker volume </p>
<p> Low volume has been an issue in various categories and on different Xiaomi/Redmi-made devices. It seems that’s the case here, as well. The loudspeaker is not that loud, headphone sound is, although without crackling, not as loud as some users would like to. Not to mention awful sound in the recordings with a bitrate that’s just subpar. </p>
<p> We can only hope that Redmi will address this with future patches, as there’s nothing else we can do to address it. That’s not completely true as there’s a way to tweak volume on rooted devices. That’s a risky business so we suggest avoiding it unless you are perfectly comfortable with rooting your device. </p>
<p> 6. Screen stuck on the dialer </p>
<p> Some users reported an unusual bug that renders the device unusable until it’s rebooted. Namely, it seems that the built-in Dialer app tends to crash and freeze the Redmi 8A for some. </p>
<p> This, of course, is something no one wants to see. Not even on a seldom basis. In order to address this, we suggest going for the Force stop in the Dialer app. After that, clear data and cache from the app. </p>
<p> If the issue persists, resetting your device to factory settings should help. Just don’t forget to back up your data first. </p>
<p> 7. Bad touch response </p>
<p> Ghost touch and “screen bleeding” are two things that users with IPS displays might run into. Now, it seems that there is a small screen bleeding on the top and bottom of the display. It’s barely visible, mostly with the dark wallpaper and on high brightness levels. Nothing too serious. </p>
<p> However, bad touch response is more of a problem. Some users on a dedicated forum have had a hard time with the touch screen responsiveness. There’s only so much you can do if this issue occurs and here’s what we suggest: </p>
<p> Turn the “Double tap to wake or turn off screen” off. </p>
<p> Remove the screen protector. </p>
<p> Clear the screen with a wet cloth. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 8. Poor Wi-Fi and Mobile signal strength </p>
<p> These fall in the category of most frequently reported issues on the Redmi 8A. If you were wondering if the Redmi 8A supports the 5 GHz wireless band, the answer is no. In addition, some users have a hard time with the bandwidth speed with the 2.4 GHz band as well. </p>
<p> Moreover, the network coverage is not all that great for some users. Not only that bad network coverage/signal affects voice calls and mobile data speeds, but it also, due to repetitive searching for network, depletes battery much faster than usual. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to troubleshoot connectivity issues on the Redmi 8A: </p>
<p> Reset APN settings to default values. </p>
<p> Remove your SIM card and re-insert it again. </p>
<p> Reboot your phone and router. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 9. Redmi 8A camera quality issues </p>
<p> The main camera is not all that great to start with (of course, we must consider the price point here), but it can be better. The problem, like on most Xiaomi phones, lies in the subpar image processing software. </p>
<p> You can mitigate that and make the camera better than expected with a GCAM port. Camera ports brought from Google Pixel devices have much better processing capabilities and will do the best with the hardware you have. </p>
<p> There are not many ports for this device at the moment (and it’s not all that likely there will be many of them). That doesn’t mean that there are none. </p>
<p> Here’s how to get yourself a GCAM port for the Redmi 8A: </p>
<p> In a browser on your handset, navigate to the Gcam Hub, here, and download one of the versions (one is for MIUI 11 on Android 10 and one is for Android Pie based MIUI 10/11). </p>
<p> Allow installation of apps from third-party sources when prompted. </p>
<p> Install Gcam and that’s it. You can tweak some options in Settings to your liking. Enjoy. </p>
<p> 10. Can’t set a lock screen wallpaper </p>
<p> This, so to say problem, is frequently reported for many MIUI-based devices out there. Users are just unable to change the lock screen wallpaper. And the solution is rather simple. </p>
<p> All you need to do is download the wallpaper to your local storage. Once there, navigate to Settings > Wallpaper in the main menu. Select the Local photos, choose a photo from an album and tap OK. Then just tap Apply and choose Lock Screen. As simple as that. </p>
<p> 11. Phone turns off on its own </p>
<p> This is a serious problem and, unless you’ve meddled with custom ROMs, we highly recommend to take your device for a repair or ask for a replacement. In most reported cases we are looking at a factory defect and thus there’s nothing you can do to resolve it on your own. </p>
<p> Contact your retailer or carrier and return the device for repairs or, preferably, ask for a new handset. </p>
<p> 12. IR Blaster doesn’t work </p>
<p> The Redmi 8A, like many other Xiaomi/Redmi devices, comes with a built-in IR Blaster that allows you to remotely control TVs, stereo devices, and even some appliances. This might come in handy. However, it seems that users are unable to utilize this nifty hardware feature on their devices. </p>
<p> First of all, make sure that your device is supported in the Mi Remote controller app. If it is supported, remove it and try pairing it again. Alternatively, you can reinstall the app and give pairing with Mi Remote controller another go. </p>
<p> 13. Common troubleshooting steps for Redmi 8A </p>
<p> Boot the device into Safe Mode </p>
<p> Turn the device off. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and then, once the Xiaomi logo appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down button. </p>
<p> To exit Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Reset the device to Factory Settings </p>
<p> Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>

<p> Hello, I’ve just bought a redmi phone and everything fine apart from a yellow tint during whatapp video calls. Making a video in the normal way is fine but video chat always yellow tint. </p>
<p> I’ve tried the advice above to go to auto in colour (and each of the possibilities). But nothing has removed the tint. Any suggestions? </p>

<p> Motorola Moto G7 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Motorola is the champion of the mid-range segment in more than a few countries, especially the USA. And for a good reason. This year, Motorola presented 4 different devices with slightly different quirks and for different price segments. The main device is the Moto G7, followed by the battery-oriented Moto G7 Power, the Moto G7 Play, and the Moto G7 Plus. </p>
<p> Now, these devices are usually sturdy and have a good build, reliable cameras, good battery life, and close-to-stock Android experience. That’s why are they often recommended by various industry professionals. However, they are not without issues. </p>
<p> To help affected Moto G7 users, we decided to collect all major (and minor, too) common issues and present them below. With some applicable solutions, of course. </p>
<p> The majority of these issues and their respective solutions might be present other devices in the G7 lineup, including Moto G7 Plus, Moto G7 Power, or Moto G7 Play. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Night mode keeps changing </p>
<p> The Night mode on Android 9-powered the Moto G7 is a bit limited as it is based on stock Android. It’s not global (for that we need to wait for the Android 10 update), but it does change the appearance in the notification shade. </p>
<p> Some users reported that the Night mode keeps changing on its own. Both ways. From Light to Dark theme and vice versa. If you have that problem, you can force one or another in Developer options. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do it with ease: </p>
<p> Open Developer options from Settings. (explained at the bottom how to enable it). </p>
<p> Navigate to Dark Mode. </p>
<p> Select Always on. </p>
<p> 2. Slow Wi-Fi </p>
<p> Users are not satisfied with the lack of 5 GHz-band support but that’s even a lesser problem. It seems that Wireless is slow for some while there are numerous threads about Access Point issues (especially on the Moto G7 Power). </p>
<p> Here are some things you can do to address Wi-Fi issues: </p>
<p> Boot into safe mode and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth and Mobile Data. </p>
<p> 3. System UI not responding </p>
<p> Certain System UI errors lead to crashes and even system failure and reboot. Some users experienced crashes while on the Home screen, while others had issues in the Settings menu. To make things worse, Motorola Update Services crashed for some during the firmware update. </p>
<p> Here are some ways to fix these rather serious issues on the Moto G7: </p>
<p> Reboot the device. </p>
<p> Limit the number of apps working in the background. You can do so in the Developer options, under the Background process limit. </p>
<p> Lower the Animations in Developer options. </p>
<p> Boot into Safe Mode and, if the device performs better, uninstall recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Reset your Moto G7 to factory settings. </p>
<p> 4. Low in-call and Bluetooth volume </p>
<p> One of the most important things about a cellphone (smart or classic) is calling and receiving calls. And that’s what’s been the problem for more than a few Moto G7 users who experienced muffled and low sound while talking on the phone. This seems to be a long-time issue on these devices and we don’t have any adequate recommendations or fix. </p>
<p> To add injury to insult, the Bluetooth audio output is not all that great as well, being too low even on the maximum setting. For this, there might be a solution and it’s hidden in Developer options. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open Developer options (explained how to enable Developer options at the bottom). </p>
<p> Navigate to Absolute Bluetooth volume. </p>
<p> Disable this option and reboot your device. </p>
<p> 5. Battery drains fast </p>
<p> The Moto G7 is on the lower side when it comes to battery. 3000 mAh is, by all means, not bad. But the 6.2-inch LCD screen is a big enough consumer to deplete it fast. Allegedly, the moderate (tolerable) Screen-on Time went down for some users, as the battery started draining faster than usual. </p>
<p> There are many reasons why that’s the case, so here are some tips to improve battery life on your Moto G7: </p>
<p> Disable background apps. You can use a third-party app to do so. </p>
<p> Make sure your signal is stable. We encourage all our readers to check available bands before purchasing devices. Bad network coverage leads to constant signal-hunting which leads to battery depletion. </p>
<p> Disable Auto-brightness and set preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Disable Location services and Bluetooth when you are not actively using them. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6. Random reboots </p>
<p> Random reboots are never a good sign. These can be caused by various hardware issues, but the system might be the culprit as well. If you are constantly bothered by random reboots on the Moto G7, we suggest resetting the handset to factory settings. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t help, make sure to take your device to responsible service and ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> 7. Can’t move photos and save media to SD card </p>
<p> This is a major Moto G7 issue, based on community reports. Users seemingly can’t move photos and supported apps to the SD card or save media from streaming services. For some, the SD card is accessible but it disappears after they reboot the device. </p>
<p> To fix the SD card issues, the only way is to format it with your device. What you need to do is back up all your data to your PC or internal storage. Once you’ve done that, format the SD card and add it as external storage, not an extension to the internal one. The latter causes issues and leads to SD card corruptions. </p>
<p> 8. The phone can’t connect to car media </p>
<p> Bluetooth connectivity is essential for folks that play their music via the car media (or use navigation) while driving. </p>
<p> That’s why the failing Bluetooth pairing issue on the Moto G7 might be a dealbreaker for some. One recommended solution if you can’t seem to find the car media is to enable the “Show Bluetooth devices without names” in Developer options. </p>
<p> We wrote an article a while ago about phone-to-car media connectivity issues. Check it out here to fix the problem. Just make sure to try it out on other Bluetooth devices. If the issue persists and the Bluetooth won’t work at all, take your device for a repair or replace it. </p>
<p> 9. How to install Gcam on the Moto G7 </p>
<p> This modern smartphone race brought a lot of good for the end-user, as we all got formidable camera setups on mid-range or even low-end devices. However, software optimization is still behind and we can say that many are quite far behind Google (and Huawei, to some extent), when it comes to processing. </p>
<p> The best thing is that there are ports of Google Camera for many devices. This includes the Moto G7. If you were wondering how to install Gcam on the Moto G7, here are the exact steps: </p>
<p> In Google Chrome on your handset, navigate to the Gcam Hub, here, and download one of the versions by tapping on it. The HDR Plus one works great on the Moto G7. Alternatively, try this one. </p>
<p> Allow installation of apps from third-party sources when prompted. </p>
<p> Install Gcam and that’s it. You can tweak some options in Settings to your liking. Enjoy. </p>
<p> 10. Screen colors not calibrated </p>
<p> The issue with colors being off was earlier addressed by tweaking certain Display settings. However, that option is (for no apparent reason), missing from the Moto G7. So, that’s a dead-end. If you are having either extremely cold (blueish) or warm (reddish) color representation, there’s nothing you can do without rooting your device. </p>
<p> You can just confirm that the Night Light is disabled, but don’t hold your hopes high as it depends on the LCD panels Motorola decided to place on their mid-range devices. </p>
<p> 11. GPS and Mobile Data not working </p>
<p> When it comes to reports about Moto G7 issues, we run into a couple of them concerning bad GPS services. For some, there are no satellites available (which is strange), while others have issues with location precision that abysmal on their devices. </p>
<p> Here are some steps you can try to fix this: </p>
<p> Enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning in Location settings. Open Settings > Security & Location > Location > Advanced. </p>
<p> Also, enable the Improve Location accuracy. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Moving on, mobile data is also an issue for some users. This can be rather isolated as it concerns certain carriers, but if your mobile data is slow or your Moto G7 won’t connect, try these troubleshooting steps to fix it: </p>
<p> Enable the Airplane mode and disable it after a minute or so. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Check whether the SIM card is properly set in the compartment. </p>
<p> Reset SIM card settings. </p>
<p> 12. No in-call and media sounds </p>
<p> There’s hardly anything worse than for the device speaker not working at all. Both Moto G7 speakers are not working (down-firing speaker and call speaker) for some users. There are some things you can try and, if they fail, make sure to ask for the replacement since we are probably looking at the hardware issue. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to troubleshoot sound issues on the Moto G7: </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Run diagnostics in the Device Help app. Open Diagnosis > Hardware Test > Receiver and run the test. If it fails, move to the next step. </p>
<p> Try with the Factory reset. </p>
<p> Ask for the replacement, the speaker is probably down. </p>
<p> 13. Ghost touch </p>
<p> Ghost touch is, among some other entries from the list, far from a small bug. Some users reported that the problem with the display prevents them from accessing Settings which is a big issue. </p>
<p> If you have issues with the ghost touch on the Moto G7, try these steps to fix it: </p>
<p> Remove the screen protector. </p>
<p> Clean your screen with a wet cloth and then dry it with the dry one. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 14. Can’t connect to a PC </p>
<p> In case you are not able to connect your Moto G7 to a PC, the problem is probably in drivers. We recommend installing proper drivers and enabling File Transfer when prompted. </p>
<p> If the issue persists and you are unable to connect to a PC, try rebooting the device or switch to an alternative USB port. </p>
<p> 15. Freezing issues </p>
<p> Users also reported freezing and slowdowns on Moto G7, especially when coming out of the sleep idle mode. This is a major issue and some weren’t able to address it even after the factory reset. </p>
<p> If the factory reset won’t help, there’s barely anything else that you can do. </p>
<p> 16. Can’t update or download apps from the Play Store </p>
<p> One user had issues with updating and downloading apps on their Moto G7. The problem lies in the outdated Play Store that, for some reason, won’t update. If you have similar issues, just force update with the latest APK of Google Play Services. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > All apps. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose to show all apps (system apps as well). </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from the Play Store and Google Play Services and reboot your device. </p>
<p> If the issue persists, navigate to any APK aggregate website, like APK Mirror, here. </p>
<p> Download the latest version of Google Play Services. </p>
<p> Run the APK and allow installation from third-party sources. </p>
<p> Install the APK and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Try accessing the Play Store again. </p>
<p> 17. Headphone jack not working </p>
<p> Another problem that some users have with Moto G7 is the inconsistent headphone jack. It seems that it suddenly stops working for some and the audio output goes directly to the main speaker. </p>
<p> If you’ve tried it with different headphones and the problem persists, contact your retailer. The problem is in the hardware. </p>
<p> 18. Netflix and other streaming apps not working </p>
<p> Multiple users reported issues with Netflix and similar streaming services that just won’t work on the wireless network for some reason. It seems that apps load without any issues while on Mobile Data. </p>
<p> If you are stuck with this issue as well, try fixing it with the steps below: </p>
<p> Uninstall Netflix and try installing Netflix APK from here. </p>
<p> Reboot your router and device. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 19. The phone won’t turn on </p>
<p> The worst problem of them all. In case your Moto G7 won’t boot at all (no signs of life), we can recommend nothing but taking it directly for a repair. Obviously, the hardware is failing. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if it just won’t boot the system, you can try and start the device in the Safe Mode from the Recovery menu. The explanation is at the bottom of the article. </p>
<p> 20. The phone vibrating or ringing for no reason </p>
<p> In regards to vibration, this is a feature, believe it or not. It can be disabled with ease and you can do it by navigating to Settings > Apps > Moto > Features > Moto Actions > Flip for Do Not Disturb. Once there, disable Flip for Do Not Disturb. </p>
<p> Ringing for no reason, on the other hand, is usually caused by a rogue app that took a ringtone (longer than the notification ones) as a default notification tone. Check all apps that might have changeable tones to disable it. </p>
<p> 21. Stock camera won’t save location </p>
<p> This is closely related to the GPS issues entry we already covered. It seems that GPS reading and the overall precision of location services on this device are often sub-par. </p>
<p> What you can do is troubleshoot GPS and just disable and re-enable the Save location option in the camera. Also, make sure that the Camera has permission to access Location. Rebooting your device might help, as well. </p>
<p> 22. The phone randomly disconnects while charging </p>
<p> This is probably a factory defect causing the problem so we recommend replacing the cable or replacing the device itself. Of course, this stands if you can confirm that your cable is original 15W Turbo Charger. </p>
<p> Alternatively, before contacting your retailer, we highly suggest resetting your device to factory settings. Although the software bug can rarely cause issues like this. </p>
<p> 23. Mic sound is muffled and low volume in calls </p>
<p> We already covered the problem with the complete absence of sound, but there’s a slightly less serious problem with the in-call sound. Some users stated on the official support forum that the sound during calls is muffled so the other side can barely hear them. </p>
<p> First, make sure that the mic is clean and remove debris and dust. After that, try restarting your device and look for improvements. You should also try and remove the protective case and screen protector, as they might be covering one or both mics on the G7. </p>
<p> 24. Important troubleshooting steps for the Moto G7 </p>
<p> Enter Developer Options </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select System. </p>
<p> Open About phone. </p>
<p> Tap on Build number 7 times. You should get the message informing you that you are now a developer. </p>
<p> Get back to the main menu of Settings and, at the bottom, you should see Developer options, </p>
<p> Boot into Safe Mode </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button to bring out the Power menu. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Power off icon until you are prompted to enter Safe mode. </p>
<p> Tap OK. </p>
<p> To get out of Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Network settings reset. </p>
<p> Choose to reset your Network settings. </p>
<p> Confirm when prompted. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> First, navigate to Settings > System > Backup and back up all your settings and app data. Besides that, make sure to connect your device to a PC and back up all your media. You can also use Google Photos to backup all your photos from the device. You’ll need your Google Account password later. </p>
<p> Once you are certain that everything can be safely deleted, in Settings > System > Advanced, choose Reset options. </p>
<p> Select Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Confirm the selection. Your device will reboot and after some time, you’ll start from scratch. </p>
<p> With that, we can conclude this lengthy article about Moto G7 issues. Thank you for reading and, in case you have additional issues to report, please do so in the comments section below. We or other readers might help you resolve the issue at hand. </p>

<p> Put in a prompted Motorola update in a brand new phone. Phone freaked. Sound became inaudible. Can’t clear cache. Freezes. Won’t always let you open MyVerizon, etc. Very disappointed. Sending it back to Verizon. Don’t want another Motorola. Like it came out of a bubble gum machine. ? This phone is junk. </p>

<p> Anyone else have trouble receiving calls? Everyday I have to reboot my G7 power because callers say it’s going right to VM. </p>
<p> I have the same issue, every couple of days at least. Was given code to erase order sending calls to VM, but don’t know why it happens to begin with. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi A3 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Xiaomi Mi A3 is a long-awaited addition to Xiaomi’s Android One roundup. However, once it was out and we all witnessed that low-res Super AMOLED display, many people saw it as a downgrade to this already classic line of stock Android devices made by Xiaomi. And it seems that there’s a whole lot of minor issues on the Xiaomi Mi A3. Nothing major, no dealbreakers (if you can live with the display), but software issues nonetheless. </p>
<p> We made sure to locate basically every noticeable bug and list them here for our readers that own the Xiaomi Mi A3. Of course, with applicable solutions or at least tips to alleviate the problem at hand. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. In the case of this particular device, based on our experience, if you like that stock Android experience and don’t mind the resolution, go for it. It’s a great bang for the buck. </p>
<p> 1. Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Various Wi-Fi issues were reported on the dedicated forum and XDA. It seems some users are not able to connect to their wireless routers while others experienced quite slow bandwidth speeds. If that’s the case for you, try these steps: </p>
<p> Moving forward, Mobile Data issues are even more prominent. Namely, some users had a hard time utilizing 4G network capabilities. If you are among them, here’s what you can try to resolve this: </p>
<p> Delete all networks and try reconnecting. </p>
<p> Set AP band to 2.4 GHz. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Reset APN and get a new configuration from your mobile carrier. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 2. Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> Some concerned users described Bluetooth connectivity on Xiaomi Mi A3 as a “hot mess”. The issues they mentioned relate to the unstable connection when the device is paired with a car, Bluetooth speakers, and even wearables. If you are experiencing issues with Bluetooth on Xiaomi Mi A3, try these steps to address them: </p>
<p> Remove pairing and establish it again. Navigate to Settings >Bluetooth and delete all paired devices. Pair the handset with the device again and try again. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Disable Automatic pairing. Pair individually with a device when you want to use it. </p>
<p> Boot into a safe mode and try connecting via Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Update the system. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Also, others are unsatisfied with the max volume on Bluetooth earbuds. Even at the max settings, the volume is too low for some. You can fix this by disabling Absolute Bluetooth volume in Developer options. Learn how to do that, here. </p>
<p> 3. Headphone volume is too low </p>
<p> In comparison to volume on devices paired with Bluetooth, there’s not much you can do with the wired alternative to make it louder. The highest volume is predetermined and if you need to make it better, you can solely ask Xiaomi to tackle this in the future update. </p>
<p> An alternative is to tweak the sound in-depth with mods, but the device needs to be rooted. We can’t suggest doing so unless you are well-informed on the matter and don’t mind losing your warranty. </p>
<p> 4. Missing navigation buttons as an option </p>
<p> Yeah, that’s a sad reality. We understand that Android Pie comes with its own gestures system, but Xiaomi should’ve included on-screen navigation buttons like on their previous Android One devices. </p>
<p> Luckily, you can use one of many third-party gesture apps that should allow for customization and can help you bring back Navigation buttons. One of them is Navigation Bar, and you can find it on the Play Store, here. Alternatively, you can use the Custom Navigation bar (Play Store link). </p>
<p> 5. Battery draining fast </p>
<p> There’s hardly any device out there in this price range that has more things going for its battery longevity. The 6.1-inch AMOLED 720p display and impressive 4030 mAh battery make Xiaomi Mi A3 one of the most promising handsets when it comes to battery longevity and Screen-on Time. </p>
<p> However, the software might be an issue, as some users reported battery draining much faster than usual. If you have battery life issues with Xiaomi Mi A3, check these tips to mitigate them: </p>
<p> Open Developer options and disable Mobile Data always on. </p>
<p> Prevent some secondary apps from working in the background. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth overnight. </p>
<p> Use Greenify or any other third-party application to limit the background processes. </p>
<p> Update your device or reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6. The fingerprint scanner is slow or unresponsive </p>
<p> First of all, the whole 720p AMOLED affair was and still is surrounding this device. The 286ppi and PenTile OLED matrix are subpar for some while others prefer its vibrant colors. </p>
<p> Was it worth to use a suboptimal display resolution just to introduce this novelty called in-display fingerprint scanner? We are not sure. However, it cuts deeper knowing that the said fancy fingerprint scanner is not working as intended for some users. </p>
<p> Some users claim that the fingerprint scanner isn’t working well when the Night light (Reading mode) is enabled. Others stated that it works slow and it takes more than usual to unlock the device. </p>
<p> If you are affected by this, try these steps we listed below: </p>
<p> Disable Night light. </p>
<p> Enroll multiple fingerprints for a single finger to improve readings and responsiveness. </p>
<p> Disable the Fingerprint icon on the screen while the phone is idle. You can do so in Settings. </p>
<p> Remove all fingerprints and add them again. At least two for every finger. </p>
<p> Remove protective film or tempered glass and try unlocking the handset without them. </p>
<p> 7. Face unlock doesn’t work </p>
<p> It seems that Face Unlock issues that users reported in previous months were addressed when the developer removed Google’s option and added the Face Unlock from MIUI. However, some users are still having a hard time unlocking Xiaomi Mi A3 with the Face Unlock method. </p>
<p> You can try one of these steps to address these issues, but the only permanent solution is to wait for an update that addresses the issue (hopefully, Android 10 will sort it out): </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Disable and re-enable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Remove and add your face again. </p>
<p> 8. Green tint and other display issues </p>
<p> Now, we’ve come to the focal point of this quite good device — the display. It’s all the question of taste and personal preferences, and many users don’t mind the 720p resolution of the PenTile OLED display at all. However, there seem to be a few problems with the display itself. </p>
<p> Allegedly, some users recognized a green tint on their displays. Since you can’t tweak contrast and colors on the Mi A3, go for a reboot. If the issue persists, reset your device to factory settings. And if it’s still present, your display might be faulty so contact your vendor. </p>
<p> Moving on, the pulse-width modulation (PWM) flicker on lower brightness can be quite bad for your eyes. Especially if you read for an extensive period. Xiaomi should address this on Android 10 by replacing PWM with DC brightness instead. We can just wait and see. </p>
<p> 9. Overheating </p>
<p> Overheating is a major issue on any phone, and it seems that it is a Xiaomi Mi A3 issue as well. Users report that the device is quite hot on touch, especially while charging. If you are experiencing temperatures that go above 40 degrees Celsius even when the device is idle or barely stressed, we recommend requesting a replacement of the device. </p>
<p> If the overheating occurs only occasionally, here are some things you can try to reduce these unpleasant (and fatal in the long term) occurrences: </p>
<p> Remove protecting casing from the device. </p>
<p> Don’t use the device while charging. </p>
<p> Keep the device away from the heat sources. </p>
<p> Let the device cool down after intensive gaming sessions. </p>
<p> Turn on Airplane mode while gaming to prevent low network coverage from causing overheating. </p>
<p> Make sure to use an adequate supported charger. </p>
<p> 10. Charging is too slow </p>
<p> Even though it supports the 18W Fast Charging, the Xiaomi Mi A3 comes with the regular 10W charger out of the box. And even with this rather slow charger (for today’s standards, of course), the battery should be full from 0 to 100 in, more or less, 2 hours and 30 minutes. </p>
<p> However, some users seemingly can’t meet that charging time, but their handsets require 3 or more hours to fully charge. For some, much more than that. To address this, we must stress that you should use the factory charger you got with the device. If you decide to obtain an 18W charger, make sure to get one from a trusted OEM. </p>
<p> After that, you can try and calibrate the battery as the battery is probably full after 2 and a half hours or so, but the readings are false. Learn how to recalibrate battery on this or any handset by following steps from this article. </p>
<p> 11. Poor camera performance </p>
<p> We all know that Xiaomi did an amazing job in the last couple of years when it comes to hardware. Even the affordable budget devices don’t lag behind much more expensive devices. The camera department included. </p>
<p> However, as we learned with the Google Pixel series, good primary Sony lenses and remarkable secondary lenses that come in numbers these days (the Mi A3 has a triple camera setup with main, ultrawide, and depth sensor), won’t do much without good software. </p>
<p> And the Xiaomi Mi A3, like many other Xiaomi handsets, suffer from software issues when it comes to camera execution. Users reported focus issues, high exposure and lack of detail, barely functional night mode and other things. </p>
<p> To avoid going through possible troubleshooting steps, we suggest just simply downloading a GCAM port and using it instead. Based on various sources, results are much better with photos taken on a GCAM port. Although, the ultrawide camera isn’t working at the time being anywhere but on the Stock camera app. </p>
<p> 12. Bootloop issues </p>
<p> Some users run into boot loop issues when they tried to flash an official update via fastboot. There seems to be an error with the fastboot script and some developers fixed it and posted it on XDA. </p>
<p> If you want to update your system to the latest release via fastboot, learn more about it in this XDA thread. You can find the fastboot ROM file for this device, here. </p>
<p> 13. Ghost touch </p>
<p> Some users have reported a ghost touch issue on the Xiaomi Mi A3. If you have experienced something similar, first remove the protective film or tempered glass. If the issue persists, reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Now, if the problem persists even after starting from scratch, we recommend contacting the responsible service or your vendor. </p>
<p> 14. No Always-on Display and Dark mode </p>
<p> Sadly, even though this is almost a norm for AMOLED (OLED) Android device, the Mi A3 lacks a built-in Always-on Display feature. There’s only something called Ambient display that pops only with the incoming notifications. Will the AOD find the place on the Mi A3 with an Android 10 update? Not likely. </p>
<p> Now, if the Ambient display isn’t showing all notifications, make sure to toggle “Show all notifications” instead of “Hide sensitive contents” in Settings. </p>
<p> Moving on, users are not satisfied with the way Xiaomi dealt with the system dark mode that covers only small portions of UI. You can try to force it by navigating to Developer options, but I am afraid that the Settings menu and the majority of apps won’t be affected by it. </p>
<p> Here’s how to force the dark mode on the Xiaomi Mi A3: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open About phone and scroll down until you reach Build number. </p>
<p> Tap on Build number 7 times and now get back to the main Settings menu. </p>
<p> Open System and tap Advanced. </p>
<p> Now, open Developer options. </p>
<p> Open Night mode and set Always on. </p>
<p> 15. Adaptive brightness issues </p>
<p> The first thing you should know about Android One’s Adaptive brightness (don’t mix it with the sensor-oriented Auto-brightness from MIUI), is that it takes some time to learn your preferences. After that, it should be more precise. What you need to do is correct it every time it sets the wrong brightness level. </p>
<p> Now, in regards to reports about fingerprint reading causing brightness spikes, you can either wait for an update to sort this out or disable Fingerprint icon. That helped some users address the problem. Here’s how to do it in a few simple steps: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Security & location. </p>
<p> Open Fingerprint. </p>
<p> Disable Fingerprint icon. </p>
<p> 16. Proximity sensor issue </p>
<p> This issue seems to be widespread on so many Xiaomi devices and it was present on both Mi A3 predecessors, Mi A1 and Mi A2. The issue is the proximity sensor bug that has completely wrong readings during phone calls. Some workarounds should help you a bit, but there’s no definite solution to date. </p>
<p> What you can do is check the position of the protective film or tempered glass and ensure that it’s not covering the sensor. After that, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Run the test to confirm that the hardware isn’t causing issues. </p>
<p> Now, in Dialer, type either *#*#6484#*#* or *#*#64663#*#*. That should open the Hardware Test menu (CIT). </p>
<p> Select Proximity sensor. </p>
<p> Place your hand on the sensor at the top and then remove it from the sensor. </p>
<p> Finally, tap Calibrate and that’s it. </p>
<p> 17. Micro SD not detected/slow </p>
<p> If your SD card is slow or even doesn’t get detected, we can only recommend to use it as the Portable storage instead of an extension to internal storage. We understand that this will limit the capabilities (installing apps to SD card instead of the internal storage won’t be available), but it is what it is. </p>
<p> After you’ve formatted the SD card, just select Portable storage and everything should work without issues. </p>
<p> 18. Bottom-firing speaker issues </p>
<p> Setting your device for the first time and testing the audio output from the speaker just to be greeted with crackling and buzzing sounds is not joyful at all. This is exactly what some users run into. This happens when the volume is high. </p>
<p> Now, we would suggest to immediately ask for the replacement as this is probably a hardware issue. However, just to be sure that the software isn’t causing it, try resetting your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 19. Important troubleshooting steps for Xiaomi Mi A3 </p>
<p> Enter Safe mode </p>
<p> Turn the device off. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and then, once the Xiaomi logo appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down button. </p>
<p> To exit Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select the Recovery mode with the single press of the Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start the Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation points should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and we hope you found solutions for issues that were bothering you. If we forgot to mention something or you need additional help with the troubleshooting, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Huawei P30 Lite common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei P30 Lite is the successor of highly-popular P Lite series and it definitely rises up to the occasion. Tripple camera setup along with the great front-facing camera, potent chipset, and solid battery make for an all-around good mid-ranger. However, as we all know, there’s no perfect device (especially software-wise) and the Huawei P30 Lite has its own share of common issues. </p>
<p> We made sure to list the most common ones and present them to you along with applicable solutions. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Battery drains </p>
<p> The first reported problem we run into is a massive hit to battery longevity some users experienced. The Huawei P30 Lite is definitely not a battery champion in the mid-range class, with a 3340 mAh battery. However, the SoT, thanks to a heavy EMUI optimization and 6.15-inch screen, shouldn’t be bad in the slightest. </p>
<p> If the battery drains started after a system update, you can try and back up your data and reset the device to factory values. On the other hand, there are some things you can do to extend battery life. Check them out below: </p>
<p> Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Disable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location Mode, and choose Device only if you’re not in need of GPS’s high accuracy at the moment. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location > 3-dot Menu > Scan settings, and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, respectively. </p>
<p> Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > and individually disable Autostart on apps. </p>
<p> Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery. </p>
<p> 2. SIM card issues </p>
<p> Since the dual-SIM is an option, many users will utilize it and use two separate nano-SIM cards on their P30 Lite. However, there seems to be an issue with the secondary SIM card for some of them, along with some 3G/4G mobile data issues. </p>
<p> If you are unable to make the second SIM card work, try removing it and placing it in again. After that reboot your device. Finally, make sure that the SIM card is activated within Settings. </p>
<p> In regards to mobile data issues, make sure setting the preferred mobile network connection in Settings. If that fails, remove SIM cards, reset Network settings, and insert SIM cards again. </p>
<p> 3. Max volume is too low </p>
<p> In such a cluttered and competitive market, many times things come to nitpicking. However, there are some legitimate downsides to the Huawei P30 Lite that users can’t find a way around. </p>
<p> One common and out-of-the-box issue with the Huawei P30 Lite is quite a low volume coming from the single bottom-firing speaker. Even if the volume is maxed out. </p>
<p> Sadly, the only thing you can do is wait for an update to address this. Due to the limited approach to OS modding (Huawei prevents bootloader unlocking), you won’t be able to do much. </p>
<p> Try enabling the Disable absolute volume option in Developer options for Bluetooth headsets, but don’t hold your hopes high in regards to the built-in speaker. </p>
<p> 4. UI lags, stutters, and ghost touch issues </p>
<p> Even though the included hardware (Huawei’s-own Kirin 710 chipset and up to 8 GB of RAM) should be enough for the P30 Lite to work without any issues, there are some reports about UI lags and stutters. </p>
<p> In order to fix this, you can try navigating to Developer options and reducing the Animation scaling and disabling some third-party apps working in the background while gaming. Here’s how to access Developer options on the Huawei P30 Lite: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open the About phone. </p>
<p> Tap 7 times on the Build number. </p>
<p> Open Developer options. </p>
<p> Navigate to Animations and reduce them from 1 to 0.5. </p>
<p> Alternatively, enable the “Force activities to be resizable” option. </p>
<p> Besides that, some users reported a ghost touch, blaming protection film. However, it seems that issues continued even when the protective film was removed. If that happens, we can only suggest resetting your device to factory values. </p>
<p> 5. No updates available </p>
<p> Huawei is not known for its timely Android updates. They are even an OEM that has the biggest OS fragmentation on their devices as users wait for months for the new release of EMUI. </p>
<p> Now, since the P30 Lite is a part of their P series from this year, updates to EMUI 10 are to be expected in April 2020 at the latest. </p>
<p> However, some users read that there’s a firmware update available. Now, if you haven’t enrolled in the Beta program for Android 10, you won’t be able to get it until the global release sees the light. </p>
<p> However, you should still receive monthly security updates and patches on EMUI 9.1. If that’s not the case, make sure to check for updates manually. If the problem persists, reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6. Camera issues </p>
<p> A major differentiating point going for flagship devices in previous years was high-end lenses with amazing photo quality. However, mid-range devices are getting there and, with all hardware included, the P30 Lite should be more than a competitive photo-taking smartphone. </p>
<p> And that’s true for the most part. Tripple camera setup is great with an above-average front-facing selfie camera. However, some users are having a hard time with the camera integration in third-party apps (e.g. Facebook Messenger, Instagram). </p>
<p> Seemingly, the quality declines a lot and the whole photo-video-taking experience is substantially slower. Especially when compared to similar or even cheaper devices. </p>
<p> Ways to tackle this are fairly limited, so we suggest clearing cache and data from the Camera app and affected apps, checking permissions and keeping your phone up to date. Hopefully, the problem will be sorted out with future updates. </p>
<p> 7. Apps won’t install </p>
<p> The Google-Huawei split lead to multiple obvious software-related issues on devices introduced in 2019. Due to limitations imposed by Google, all Google services are prohibited on certain versions of the P30 Lite. </p>
<p> Now, the Europan version (MAR-LX1A) should integrate Google services without any issues as most of the others. However, there’s a slight chance you got a device that goes by as the Huawei Nova 4X, chances are you won’t be able to get Google services. </p>
<p> If you are certain that your version works with Google services, make sure to first update your device. If the problem persists, reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 8. Overheating issues </p>
<p> Overheating is, as the majority of problems here, a not quite widespread issue on the Huawei P30 Lite. However, the problem seems to occur for some users, especially while talking on the phone. Namely, the handset gets really hot after some time. In other instances, like extensive gaming sessions, overheating is not uncommon. </p>
<p> There are multiple ways to reduce overheating on your handset, so check out these steps below: </p>
<p> Remove the protective casing while talking on the phone. </p>
<p> Make sure you have good network coverage as the bed network coverage will lead to overheating on some devices. </p>
<p> Don’t use your device while charging. </p>
<p> If the problem started after an update, reset your device to factory settings and restore it from a backup. </p>
<p> 9. Gallery images are corrupt </p>
<p> This one is simple. There’s no chance that photos or videos on your device will “get corrupt”. The SD card, on the other hand, is quite capable of getting corrupt. </p>
<p> The only reason why images or any other multimedia file is missing might be due to either SD card not being loaded (might be a physical problem in placement or permission issue) or being corrupt. </p>
<p> If the latter happened, there’s not much you can do. You can try connecting your SD card to a PC and extracting data that way. Other than that, you can only format it and start from scratch. </p>
<p> 10. Useful troubleshooting steps for the Huawei P30 Lite </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition (to resolve app certain app issues): </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select the Recovery mode with the single press of the Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start the Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation points should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article about the Huawei P30 Lite common issues and their respective solutions. You can send tickets to Huawei and inform them about bugs, here. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share issues we overlooked in the comments section below. </p>

<p> MIUI 11 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Ever since Xiaomi’s first handsets, their custom Android skin, MIUI, has been a hit or miss. In late October of 2019, Xiaomi started pushing MIUI 11, intended to initially stick to Android 9 Pie while Android 10 iterations were expected in the first quarter of 2020. </p>
<p> Some people completely avoid Xiaomi/Redmi devices because of MIUI, others learn to live with it after some tweaking (learning how to debloat MIUI can improve the experience significantly). </p>
<p> And the same hit-or-miss approach can be seen with the latest iteration of MIUI. Xiaomi pilled up features to MIUI 11 which, as a result, brought a lot of issues to their users around the world. </p>
<p> We decided to list common MIUI 11 issues here, the ones we can find online, and share them with you, our readers. Also, we made sure to offer some applicable solutions, too. You can read in-detail about various reported issues below. </p>
<p> 1. Battery drains faster than on MIUI 10 </p>
<p> This is probably the most commonly-reported bug on MIUI 11, no matter what iteration or Android version (Android 9 or Android 10). We read through a bunch of reports about battery drainage from users who updated from MIUI 10 to still-mint MIUI 11. </p>
<p> Now, before we move to some steps that should help you reduce battery drainage, especially when the device is idle (overnight), we must suggest something. </p>
<p> Namely, for this and similar MIUI 11 issues, it’s advised to reset your device to factory settings after you install a major update. Especially if Android versions are different. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reduce battery draining on MIUI 11: </p>
<p> Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Disable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and individually disable Autostart on apps. </p>
<p> Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery. </p>
<p> 2. Battery calibration issues </p>
<p> Even though this issue isn’t exactly ROM-dependant, meaning it doesn’t have to be caused by the transition to MIUI 11, it does appear for some users on MIUI 11 exclusively. What’s exactly the problem? </p>
<p> Well, it seems that the battery percentage is changing erratically. Instead of gradually depleting, users state that battery suddenly drops (e.g. from 70% to 50% in a matter of minutes). This points towards false readings, as the battery is seemingly not calibrated. </p>
<p> Battery calibration is not something hard to do, although it is a process. You can learn how to calibrate your battery with ease by following steps in this article, here. </p>
<p> 3. Picture-in-Picture mode (PiP) issues </p>
<p> There seems to be an issue with PiP mode as well. Based on reports, users who switch to Picture-in-Picture mode (on YouTube, VLC, or other supported apps) and then try to open Recent apps experienced crashes or black screens. It seems that this is, to this day, not fully addressed. </p>
<p> You can try clearing the app’s cache and ensuring that all necessary permissions are granted but, other than that, we can only wait for developers to address this. </p>
<p> Besides that and worth mentioning, it seems that the XS screen setting makes for quite a convoluted mess. You can navigate to Developer options and reduce DPI if you want to set text size and Font weight to XS. </p>
<p> 4. Lags and stutters </p>
<p> Animation lags and small transition UI stutters were somewhat always an issue on MIUI ROMs. Nothing that grave but still noticeable and rather peculiar, especially if we consider hardware capabilities Xiaomi/Redmi devices have these days. </p>
<p> The problem makes overall experience bad as even the most regular transitions on the home screens or opening recent apps is slow. We can safely blame lack of optimization for this, especially on Android 10 versions of MIUI 11. </p>
<p> There are some things that you can do to mitigate this to some extent. An example being lowering the animation scale in Developer options. Not much, as only the developer can resolve the problem fully. Have in mind that Chinese ROM performs worse than the Global one. </p>
<p> 5. Apps crashing or freezing </p>
<p> Another quite a catastrophic issue for those affected. As stated by users on various forums, certain third-party apps (system apps, like App Vault, too) keep crashing on MIUI 11, leading to a crash prompt and/or black screen. This especially appears to be the case when users minimize the app and try to get back to it from the Recent screen. </p>
<p> This is, again, hard to tackle with any troubleshooting step or workaround except with the factory reset. You can reinstall affected apps and give it a go, although we don’t believe this will address the issue. So, back up your data and reset the device to factory settings. If that doesn’t help, wait for updates. Alternatively, you can downgrade to MIUI 10. </p>
<p> 6. Wi-Fi, Mobile Data, and Hotspot issues </p>
<p> MIUI 11 issues with connectivity are not that widespread, although the Hotspot inability to share connection succeded the same issue from MIUI 10. Some users said that the wireless speeds dropped significantly, others that they are unable to utilize mobile data and it even seems that VoLTE (and Wi-Fi Calling, for some) is missing. </p>
<p> Here are some troubleshooting steps to try to resolve connectivity issues, including Wi-Fi, Mobile Data, and Hotspot problems on MIUI 11: </p>
<p> Enable Airplane mode and disable it after a minute. </p>
<p> Reboot your phone and router. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 7. AOD and pulsating notifications issues </p>
<p> Xiaomi made another breakthrough in 2019 by adding more than a few devices with AMOLED displays into their lineup. And what’s an AMOLED-equipped device without Always-on display feature. </p>
<p> Thus, they decided to add AOD to MIUI 11 and, based on reports, they did a good job. Mostly. There are still things to work on, starting from brightness issues and overall usability of AOD on MIUI 11. They are still new to it but things like missing notifications are something users won’t tolerate. </p>
<p> Also, due to a lack of notification LEDs on contemporary devices, Xiaomi implemented pulsating notifications when the screen is off. They are also hit or miss since the brightness is too low for them to be of any use in light conditions. </p>
<p> Again, these are issues on the developer side. Update your device and hope that the next MIUI 11 iteration will address the problem. The community is quite vocal about these shortcomings so we can expect results soon enough. </p>
<p> 8. Dark mode bugs </p>
<p> If there’s one thing that was (and still is) globally trending when it comes to feature additions in Android 10, that’s Dark mode. Xiaomi incorporated it in MIUI 11 with a wider approach than on MIUI 10, making most of the system apps compatible with it. </p>
<p> However, there are some problems with the Dark mode on MIUI 11 for users that upgraded to it from MIUI 10, where it was working as intended. They can’t enable it or, in some instances, disable its scheduling. </p>
<p> And again, it saddens us but the factory reset is your best bet to resolve this. Alternatively, there seems to be a way for rooted devices to enable VoLTE (as explained on XDE, here), but we don’t recommend it if you don’t know your way around unlocking bootloader or rooting. </p>
<p> 9. Camera issues </p>
<p> Camera software seems to be one of the gravest problems on Xiaomi devices packed with capable lenses made by Sony or Samsung. It seems that some nifty additions to the Camera app were not enough to overlook stutters and overall general slow processing speeds, oversaturation, or preposterous audio recording quality. </p>
<p> Some of these are yet to be addressed by Xiaomi while others are minor bugs that should be gone before the official Android 10-based MIUI 11 hits the majority of supported devices. For the time being, try clearing the camera cache. </p>
<p> 10. Game Turbo Mode crashes apps </p>
<p> One of the most advertised MIUI 11 features must be the Game Turbo 2.0 mode that optimizes background processes and provides an overlay with a plethora of interesting options. However, some users experienced issues with third-party apps working in the background while the Turbo Mode was on. </p>
<p> If you are having issues with the Game Turbo mode, we recommend adding affected apps to Memory exceptions and disabling Performance optimization. That should resolve the problem until they tweak the Game Turbo in the upcoming patches. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to disable Performance optimization and add affected apps to the Memory exceptions list: </p>
<p> Open Settings and then Special features. </p>
<p> Open the Game Turbo mode. </p>
<p> Tap on the shield-like icon to open Settings. </p>
<p> Once there, open toggle Performance optimization off. </p>
<p> Then tap on the Memory exceptions and add apps you don’t want to limit while gaming (Facebook and WhatsApp are usually affected). </p>
<p> 11. GPS issues </p>
<p> GPS on Android handsets has such a widespread use these days that many third-party apps depend on it. Luckily, on Android 10, you can limit access to Location Services. However, MIUI 11 seemingly has an issue with third-party apps with GPS readings that are not precise at all. Especially with Google Maps that barely work for some users. </p>
<p> If you are experiencing issues with GPS and Google Maps (or any other Location-dependent app), make sure to enable Assisted GPS and give Location permissions to affected apps. Also, you can test hardware in CIT by typing the *#*#6484#*#* code in the dialer. </p>
<p> 12. Can’t install Netflix from the Play Store and Widevine is L3 </p>
<p> Some users stated that they are unable to download and install Netflix via the Play Store for some reason. If you are using Chinese ROM, Netflix won’t be available for download. You can, of course, download an APK from any APK-aggregating website. </p>
<p> Netflix, like some other streaming services, uses various levels of Widevine DRM to limit the streaming quality to 480p or 720p on certain devices. If you have Widevine L1, you can stream 1080p, while the L3 allows only HD streaming (720p). MIUI 11 Global officially supports L3 but make sure that your bootloader is locked. </p>
<p> 13. Google Assistant won’t start on Mi 9 </p>
<p> Xiaomi’s flagship, Mi 9, comes with the dedicated AI button. This physical button worked great for users on MIUI 10, but it seems it stopped summoning Google Assistant on MIUI 11. </p>
<p> The best way to address this is to update your firmware. That should resolve the problem completely. But, beforehand, make sure to navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Default apps. Once there, ensure that Google’s services are set under the Voice assistant and Assist & voice input settings. </p>
<p> 14. The fingerprint reader is inconsistent </p>
<p> The under-the-display fingerprint readers can be found on more than a few AMOLED devices Xiaomi presented in 2019. Based on the community’s feedback, they are hardly comparable in speeds to back-mounted fingerprint scanners and are not as precise. On the other hand, they are certainly an innovation in the evergrowing market. </p>
<p> Now, it seems that the already lackluster precision and speeds become even worse after an update to MIUI 11. </p>
<p> If that’s the case for you, check these instructions to improve fingerprint readings: </p>
<p> Remove the protective tempered glass (or make sure you are using a supported one). </p>
<p> Add fingerprints for a single finger multiple times. </p>
<p> Remove and add fingerprints again. </p>
<p> Disable always-on fingerprint icon. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 15. Google Pay not working </p>
<p> Google Pay, like the aforementioned Netflix app, has certain security requirements in order to work. Some users stated that adding the card and configuring it is a walk in a park but, for no apparent reason, terminals won’t accept payments with MIUI 11-powered devices. </p>
<p> First of all, make sure to use the HCE wallet option. Alternatively, clear the app’s cache and data to resolve possible issues. </p>
<p> 16. Important troubleshooting steps for MIUI 11 </p>
<p> Enable access to Developer options </p>
<p> Open Settings and then My device. </p>
<p> Select All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number. </p>
<p> Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options. </p>
<p> Scroll down and open “Reset WLAN, mobile networks, and Bluetooth“. </p>
<p> Tap Reset settings. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings </p>
<p> Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> With that said, we can (at least for the time being), conclude this article. Thank you for reading and make sure to add more MIUI 11 bugs or issues we forgot to mention in the comments section below. We’ll make sure to add them to the list and try and help you in solving them. </p>

<p> Pocophone F1 common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> The global market is full of great but pricey devices. And not everyone can afford a device with the premium specs for 1000 or so bucks. That’s why the Pocophone F1 came as a surprise. A handset with the flagship CPU and all-around great specs for $300? Well, thanks to Xiaomi, this is a real thing. The Pocophone F1 packs a strong punch for a mid-range device. </p>
<p> But, after the initial well-deserved hype, some issues came to light. The most prominent ones concern the display, but there are more things which deserve a mention. That’s why we prepared a list of all common issues users reported. Will try and give you solutions for these issues, also. In addition, we’ll try to add additional issues or solutions as soon as they pop-up. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching it, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1: Multitouch issue </p>
<p> This is the first major problem users have run into. The Pocophone F1, like any other modern handset, supports a 10-fingers multitouch. However, it seems that’s not the case in practice. Users especially experienced the problem during gaming, in PUBG and similar games. Either the display touch panel was able to read only a single touch or there was a ghost touch. The latter means that display reactions come with a latency. </p>
<p> Also, the precision of the touch has shown rather lackluster results until today. These are serious problems, but there seems to be a software solution. Follow these steps to try and address the multitouch error on the Pocophone F1: </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Remove the tempered glass. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Additional settings > Button and gesture shortcuts and disable the Screenshot gesture. </p>
<p> Run the device in a safe mode. </p>
<p> Update the device. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 2: Screen bleeding issue </p>
<p> In comparison to multitouch issues, this is, sadly, a hardware problem. Namely, some users’ reports state that there’s a case of the LCD screen bleeding. The bottom part of the display panel illuminates and it seems that it’s badly placed. </p>
<p> Since this is a hardware issue on the isolated device, we strongly suggest asking for the replacement or a refund. A repair is also an option, but we advise against it. Just ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> 3: Bad brightness display sensor </p>
<p> Bad adaptive sensor readings are hardly a novelty for Xiaomi. The Adaptive brightness is a universal feature which automatically sets the brightness based upon the ambient light. As some users stated, this feature is rather erratic on the Poco F1, as the sensor frequently misses the optimal brightness levels. And the brightness either gets too low or too high, respectively. </p>
<p> Now, this can be resolved by some software patches. But, for the time being, until it’s sorted out, we suggest disabling the Automatic brightness and tweaking the display brightness by hand. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Display. </p>
<p> Disable Ambient display. </p>
<p> In addition, you can use a third-party app as the main regulator of the ambient brightness sensor. </p>
<p> 4: No battery percentage indicator/status bar notifications </p>
<p> This is not a problem per se. This is, sadly, an overlooked option due to a notch status optimization. Users are neither able to see the notification icons in the status bar nor the battery percentage. Until they swipe down the Control center. This is frequently mentioned on various forums, but we suggest sharing your concerns on the official forum, here. </p>
<p> That way the developers will be able to tweak this and make changes before the next system update comes out. </p>
<p> 5: Battery drainage </p>
<p> The Poco F1 comes with a 4000 mAh battery which provides a rather good SoT (Screen-On-Time). However, some users are suspicious about the idle drainage overnight. Namely, some of them lost up to 20% of the battery overnight. While the phone was completely idle. </p>
<p> To make a better in-depth checkup with an advanced tool which requires flashed ROM. In order to avoid all that fuzz, we’ll hit you up with some general troubleshooting steps. Make sure to try them out and the battery life should get back to normal. Here are the steps: </p>
<p> Open Developer options and disable Mobile Data always on. </p>
<p> Prevent some secondary apps from working in the background. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi overnight. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6: Lags </p>
<p> It’s unexpected for a device with a Snapdragon 845 to have any visible lags, but that’s where the software comes into play. The reported problems include keyboard delay and lag, and not-so-fluid behavior when scrolling through the app drawer or recent apps. </p>
<p> These can be assigned to the multitouch problem as well, but we still suggest some software-related troubleshooting steps. Just in case. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Clear cache from the app which freezes the most. </p>
<p> Disable apps from working in the background. Greenify should serve the purpose. </p>
<p> Update your device for a possible update fix. </p>
<p> Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 7: Camera issue </p>
<p> There’s a good reason why a lot of knowledgeable users try to port the Google Cam on lots of Xiaomi devices. The hardware isn’t bad for the price tag, but the software optimization often lacks some depth. For example, the photos a rear camera makes are too warm in comparison to some other similar models. Also, the portrait mode isn’t exactly good. Luckily, the developer promised fixes in the upcoming updates. </p>
<p> Besides that, some users reported crashes and blue dots in the camera interface. This isn’t something serious and can be dealt with the following steps: </p>
<p> Boot into Safe mode and test the camera. </p>
<p> Clear Camera app’s data. </p>
<p> Update the device. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 8: Microphone issue </p>
<p> Good microphone performance is of the utmost importance. Most of the users are satisfied with the mic sound input the Poco F1 makes. However, some of them had various problems with sound distortion while talking on the phone. </p>
<p> Here’s how to address some of the microphone issues on Poco F1: </p>
<p> Make sure there’s no any debris filling in the mic compartment. </p>
<p> Enable Microphone permission for all associated apps. </p>
<p> Reset Apps preferences. </p>
<p> Use a third-party app to configure the microphone. </p>
<p> 9: Distorted audio </p>
<p> In comparison to some other entries on this list, this is quite a prominent problem. Lots of sound issues appeared while gaming and on the 3.5-inch headphones, but even the built-in speakers are either too low on volume or too loud. In addition, there’s a metallic, muffled and distorted sound output bothering some users. </p>
<p> These are already being worked on by the developers, as we find out on the official support forum. However, until the finite resolution comes, you can try some of these steps to resolve sound issues in Pocophone F1: </p>
<p> Disable absolute volume in Developer options. Open System settings > About phone and tap 7 times on the Build number to unlock Developer options. Once you can access them, toggle “Disable Absolute volume” on. </p>
<p> If the sound issues emerge in video streaming apps (e.g. YouTube), reset the app to factory settings and try again. </p>
<p> Use a medical alcohol and cloth to clear the mic and speaker. After that, you can use a compressed air to remove all debris. </p>
<p> Boot your device in a Safe mode and test the speaker both with media files and in calls. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> 10: Fingerprint scanner and face unlock issues </p>
<p> With Pocophone F1, Xiaomi went a step further in the biometric security measures with the implementation of IR scanning for a more advanced Face unlock. In addition, there’s also a good old fingerprint reader, which is, just like all other Xiaomi handsets, quite fast. But, users have had some issues with one or another, as the setup and usage are not as seamless as advertised. </p>
<p> Of course, these are isolated cases, but we still advise contacting the support. But, before that, give a try to these workarounds before sending your device for a replacement: </p>
<p> Re-configure the fingerprint and set a new Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Try booting into Safe mode and, if the fingerprint and IR scanner perform better, uninstall all recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Remove the tempered glass or cases which may cover the fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Clean the fingerprint sensor from a debris and greasy dirt with a wet cloth. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory values. In most occasions, we suggest restoring your device from a backup afterward. In this case, we suggest starting clean. </p>
<p> 11: Android Auto won’t work </p>
<p> Android Auto is an important piece of the Android ecosystem and an irreplaceable feature for lots of users who value Android features on their car’s board computer. Especially Maps, Waze, calls, and multimedia playback. However, it seems that some users weren’t able to connect and configure Android Auto when pairing the car system and the Pocophone F1. </p>
<p> This can be a dealbreaker for so many users which chose the Pocophone F1 as their daily driver. Nonetheless, until the official patch addresses this, you can try these steps and, hopefully, make it work: </p>
<p> Reinstall the Android Auto app on the Pocaphone F1. </p>
<p> Allow all permissions to Android Auto. </p>
<p> Allow USB debugging in the Developer options. </p>
<p> 12: The phone won’t update </p>
<p> Finally, we have mentioned a system update as a viable solution for many aches the Pocaphone F1 has. However, it’s hard to resolve software issues if you’re unable to download updates in the first place. </p>
<p> There are a dozen reports about update errors. Some say that they have available updates while others haven’t got a single update notification. Either way, here are some steps you can try out to get the latest update for the Poco F1: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> Open Developer Options and disable Auto-update and check for updates manually. </p>
<p> Reset the Pocophone F1 to factory settings. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. In case you have any problems we forgot about, suggestions, or alternative solutions make sure to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Android 10 arrives on Nokia 7.1, causes some issues </p>
<p> Two days ago, Nokia announced the rollout of Android 10 to the Nokia 7.1. This announcement marks the third Nokia phone to receive the Android 10 update, after the Nokia 8.1 and Nokia 9 PureView received it a few days back. </p>
<p> According to the company, the Nokia 7 Plus, 6.1, and 6.1 Plus are next in line for Android 10. Users of these devices should start receiving Android 10 by the end of the year, or at the beginning of 2020. </p>
<p> The update brings all of Android 10’s signature features to the Nokia 7.1, including the popular Dark Mode, the new gestures, and the redesigned permissions system. However, the new Android 10 Focus Mode is set to arrive later, as it’s still in beta. </p>
<p> How to update Nokia 7.1 to Android 10 </p>
<p> The global rollout of Android 10 has just started, which means some users will probably have to wait a day or two for the update to appear for them. You’ll be notified when the update is ready for install, but you can also check manually to make sure its there. </p>
<p> Here’s how to update your Nokia 7.1 to Android 10: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Navigate to About Phone > System updates. </p>
<p> Tap Check for Updates to check if your phone has received the update yet. </p>
<p> Nokia 7.1 Android 10 issues </p>
<p> Some users have already installed the update. While the update’s been a smooth ride for some, others are experiencing a few issues. Here’s what one user reported on Nokia forums: </p>
<p> “Audio is messed up. there is a distortion when you play WhatsApp audio messages, the same issue is with some games and broadcasting apps like BIGO Tv, etc.. </p>
<p> Battery Draining so Fast, hardly 5-6 Hours standby time. </p>
<p> It takes forever to charge the phone, no quick charge at all. </p>
<p> When you switch between apps, every app just reloads itself, the duration to keep them in memory was good enough in Pie“. </p>
<p> Now, that doesn’t mean you’ll encounter the same issues when you install Android 10 on your Nokia 7.1. You may not have a single problem, or something else might bother you. It’s really a roll of the dice. </p>
<p> If you have encountered any problems upon installing Android 10 on your phone, feel free to share them with us in the comments below. </p>

<p> Since the 10 update my phone is now constantly stuck on headphone mode, or to put it differently, the speaker on my phone doesn’t work in any calls, for listening to music or any other audio from media. The alarm works and the message sound sometimes does. It’s really annoying since my phone is for me for 1.Communication, 2.Music, 3.Camera. I only bought it in 2019 so that’s pretty, fuxxing annoying. DAMN NOKIA, GET ONTO FIXING THIS ASAP! Or my next phone is a Motorola again 🙁 </p>

Always start by asking for the installation of the update, download then install it, after “optimization of applications” starts several times on the screen “AndroidOne” (5 times I think) then ends up displaying the message: “boot reason: enablefilecrypto_failed” then propose the factory reset (I did it several times) No improvement for more than a week. I need my phone! Thank you NOKIA !! </p>

<p> My phone’s stock camera is working, but the third party Google Camera, Snapchat or Instagram cameras are not working. Weirdly the Whatsapp Camera is only working. Rest all say that the app failed to click the image. Any help? </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> 5S: IOS11.1.2 Garbage!! Battery dies within 6 hrs of moderate use, DCIM folder half-empty when I try to open on PC – if I can access it at all – intermittent.., texts not received by recipient, apps take forever to load – fb will load then crash.. </p>

<p> The 11.1.2 has rendered my wifi inoperable. I cannot access Bluetooth either. My iPhone 7 Plus keeps trying to activate Bluetooth but never completes turning it on. I have lost wifi connection and the virtual switch is locked; it doesn’t slide to “on” position. Apple techs have told me to erase all data and restart fresh as if it’s a new phone without using iCloud backups. I’ve done 3 times exactly as I was told but still have the same problems in addition to having lost all my data. Furthermore, this 11.1.2 version has remained in my phone system –… Read more » </p>

<p> Fix: Telegram issues in Android </p>
<p> There are so many instant messengers nowadays that share similar traits and users are not sure which to use. Telegram is one of those that are slowly emerging as a go-to option for users that put privacy and multi-platform usability above everything else. </p>
<p> The Telegram instant messenger is stable and reliable, but there are some issues that can affect it from time to time. For that purpose, we enlisted the most common issues with workarounds. In case you’ve experienced something unusual, make sure to check the list below. In addition, the Telegram developers are always open to help. So, if you’re unable to resolve the issue with the presented workarounds, you can contact them here. </p>
<p> Can’t install Telegram </p>
<p> This is an obvious problem. In order to use this nifty instant messenger, you’ll need to install it from the Play Store. However, some users have had issues with the installation in the first place. The first thing you should check is the system requirements. And these are the requirements you have to meet in order to install and run Telegram on your Android handset: </p>
<p> Multiple permissions that include: camera, contacts, location, microphone, phone, SMS, storage and others. </p>
<p> If you meet those requirements and grant permissions but you’re still unable to install the app, you should clear Play Store cache and try again. If the problem is persistent nonetheless, we advise you to try the APK file and install Telegram that way. These are the instructions you should follow in order to download and install the APK file: </p>
<p> Download the wanted version’s APK here to your PC. </p>
<p> Extract the file with WinRar or similar tool until you have the APK file. </p>
<p> Connect the Android device to the PC via USB and transfer the APK file to internal memory. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Security, and enable Unknown sources. </p>
<p> Use a native file explorer or File Explorer to navigate to the folder where the APK file is stored. </p>
<p> Tap to install the APK file. </p>
<p> After the process is finished, you should be able to run Telegram. </p>
<p> Make sure to obtain the app from the trusted source. </p>
<p> Messages fail to deliver </p>
<p> Certain users reported that, no matter how many times they try, recipients can’t see their messages. This is a major issue since it completely deflates the usability of this usually great instant messenger. What you need to do when something like this occurs is to check further steps and look for changes. </p>
<p> Make sure that the message is sent in the first place. Check connection and look for the 2 check marks. </p>
<p> Confirm that the recipient hasn’t blocked you. </p>
<p> Something with notifications can be the issue. Maybe the check marks aren’t displaying properly even though the message is indeed delivered and read. </p>
<p> The Secret Chat function is device-related. If you (and your recipient) configured this feature on certain devices, they can be accessed only through that exact device. </p>
<p> Moreover, you can try to clear the cache and, eventually, reinstall the app, if the problem is persistent. </p>
<p> To clear the Telegram’s cache, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Open Telegram. </p>
<p> Choose Storage. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you’re in need for more drastic approach, this is how to reinstall Telegram: </p>
<p> Open the App drawer or App menu. </p>
<p> Tap and draw the Telegram shortcut to the top to uninstall it. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Choose Install. </p>
<p> Follow the in-app instructions to configure your Telegram settings. </p>
<p> This should relieve you of the issues. </p>
<p> Can’t import contacts </p>
<p> As you’re probably aware, most of the instant messengers (including Telegram) need your number in order to connect with the contacts. Basically, all folks in your contacts list that use the Telegram instant messenger, should be added to your in-app contacts after you connect your device. Sadly, it seems that there is a bug that blocks the import of individual contacts. There are some things that you can do in order to overcome this obstacle. </p>
<p> Stop the app or restart your device. Just open the Active Apps window and stop Telegram. </p>
<p> Change some letters in the troubled contact. In addition, if you use non-alphabetical symbols (that differ from standard English), try renaming them. Once the contact is imported, you can restore its original name. </p>
<p> Make sure that the permission is granted. Telegram needs permission to access your Contacts. To make sure that’s the case, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Permissions. </p>
<p> Tap Contacts. </p>
<p> Enable Telegram. </p>
<p> With that, you should be able to import all contacts. </p>
<p> Notification issues </p>
<p> The Telegram instant messenger has two ways to present you with the notifications. One is, obviously, Google Cloud Messaging notification service that is an Android built-in feature. The second and primary was is app-related and it depends on various phone settings. Namely, certain Android features on specific Android devices tend to block notifications in order to reduce the power consumption. That’s the main reason why you’re not seeing notifications on your device. </p>
<p> Accordingly, you have to make sure that the phone settings are optimized for background use of Telegram. These are some things you have to do in order to receive the notifications as intended. </p>
<p> Install the latest app version. Navigate to Play Store and check for updates. </p>
<p> Check in-app settings. Open Telegram > 3-line menu > Settings > Notifications and Sounds. Make sure that Message and Group alerts are enabled. </p>
<p> Enable Keep-Alive Service and Background Connection. Open Telegram > 3-line menu > Settings > Notifications and Sounds. Scroll down until you reach Other. There you can enable both Keep-Alive Service and Background Connection. </p>
<p> If your handset packs a system manager of some kind, there’s a chance that it reads Telegram as a power-intensive app and prevent notifications. Navigate to the manager app and set Telegram as a protected app or enable it to work in the background freely. </p>
<p> Enable Lock Screen notifications in the phone settings. </p>
<p> Telegram can’t connect </p>
<p> When it comes to connection, the problem is, at least most of the time, not app-related. Most of the time, the problem lies within your Wi-Fi configuration and/or its overall instability. There are some usual troubleshooting steps you can take in order to resolve this problem. Additionally, you can wait for some time since the cloud nature of Telegram means that sometimes the service might be down. </p>
<p> Reset your phone and wireless router. </p>
<p> ‘Forget’ your network and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Use 2.4Ghz signal instead of 5Ghz. With Nougat, the option to change Wi-Fi signal is removed so you’ll have to change your router configuration or use third-party programs and tweak settings. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Try switching from Wi-Fi to 3G and vice versa. </p>
<p> There’s a chance that crowded public networks won’t work as a home network. </p>
<p> Moreover, if other connection-dependent apps work great, you can try the following steps: </p>
<p> Force Stop app. </p>
<p> Clear apps cache and data. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app. </p>
<p> Disable proxy within the phone and app’s settings. </p>
<p> ”Last seen” isn’t displayed correctly </p>
<p> ”Last seen” feature is vastly spread on all known instant messengers. And Telegram isn’t excluded. However, some users reported issues with this function. Occasionally, they can’t see the ”Last seen” information or the time showing isn’t properly displayed. For that purpose, we advise you to follow the steps below and look for changes. </p>
<p> Restart your app. </p>
<p> Since Telegram uses automatically your time zone. If you’ve tweaked date and time on your own, there’s a chance that you’ll see different information. </p>
<p> Clear app cache. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app. </p>
<p> That should conclude our list. Telegram is an amazing and often over criticized without the proper reasons, so we advise all to at least give it a try. What are your thoughts on Telegram? Don’t forget to post your questions or suggestions in the comments section below. </p>
<p> We hope that this was a helpful read. Thanks for reading and have a nice day. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy A50 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy A50 is steadily climbing the ladder to the top of the mid-range segment. It appears that the phone became an instant success, as Samsung reshaped its mid-range strategy to bring an even better pack for the value. </p>
<p> Sure, the Galaxy A50 is an all-around exceptional device. But no smartphone is perfect, as some issues arise sooner or later. And this has nothing to do with the A50 being a mid-range device. After all, the Galaxy S10 has a plethora of issues, as well. It all comes down to how you use your phone. </p>
<p> So, if you recently encountered a certain problem on your Galaxy A50, chances are I’ll mention it in this article. Just find the problem you’re looking for, and I hope you’ll find the solution, as well. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Fingerprint issue </p>
<p> Although the A50 doesn’t feature an ultra-sonic fingerprint sensor, as its flagship cousin does, we can still include it in the first generation of smartphones to boast an optical in-display scanner. As much as Samsung (and all other companies) tested it before the official launch, it’s still the first generation. And the first generation of any tech isn’t the most reliable one. </p>
<p> Users notice that in everyday use. There are numerous reports of the fingerprint sensor missing the scan or not working properly. If you too have to say a few bad words about the in-display scanner, I’m sorry, but you just have to bear with it and keep in mind it’s the first generation tech that doesn’t work as intended every time. </p>
<p> Sure, Samsung promises software updates that will supposedly improve the fingerprint scanner’s responsiveness and accuracy, but whether that will indeed be the case is questionable. The only thing left for you is to keep your phone up to date and hope for the best. Changing or removing the screen protector could also be helpful, but I honestly doubt it’s the main reason for the slow fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> 2. No LED notification light </p>
<p> If you’re wondering why the LED light doesn’t blink when you receive a notification (as it probably did on your previous smartphone), it’s because the Galaxy A50 doesn’t have one. This is not a problem per se, but maybe you missed this information when researching the A50 before you bought it, so it doesn’t hurt if I mention it again. </p>
<p> 3. Internet connection problems </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing internet connection problems, try clearing the browser cache and data. If the issue persists, check this article for additional solutions. </p>
<p> 4. Bluetooth problems </p>
<p> A few users reported an unusual Bluetooth problem that prevents them from pairing their phone with a Bluetooth device. Apparently, there’s still no real solution to this problem. Hopefully, Samsung will address the pairing issue in some of the future updates. </p>
<p> Sure, I can tell you to try generic solutions like restarting your phone, re-establishing the connection, check if the Airplane mode is disabled, but I doubt any of these will actually resolve the problem. It won’t hurt if you try, though. </p>
<p> 5. Battery drains </p>
<p> Battery drain is perhaps the biggest problem A50 owners face right now. And when your phone has a 4000 mAh battery, the last thing you have in mind is a battery drain. But it just seems to be happening. </p>
<p> Apparently, some of the recent updates messed up with battery, so there’s really nothing you can do, except waiting for Samsung to release a fixing update. Nobody knows when will it happen, so keep checking every day. </p>
<p> In the meantime, make sure some other factors don’t affect the battery life. For example, go to Settings > Battery usage, and see which app consumes the most power. If you notice something unusual, uninstall or at least limit that app. </p>
<p> 6. Can’t play Netflix in HD </p>
<p> In case you’re unable to play Netflix videos in HD, I have bad news for you. Streaming Netflix in HD is not supported on the Galaxy A50! But it shouldn’t be like this, because the Galaxy A50 supports the Widevine L1 DRM, which is enough to play HD videos on streaming platforms. </p>
<p> However, even if the phone has the prerequisites, Netflix is hesitant to allow it to stream HD content for some reason. Nobody knows when/if this conflict will be resolved. What we do know is that some older versions of the Netflix app actually allow HD content, which adds up to the confusion even more. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, if you can’t live without watching Netflix in HD, you can install an APK file of some previous version of the app. According to users, the last working version is Netflix 6.20.1 build 51 31579. </p>
<p> 7. Screen brightness too high </p>
<p> Samsung’s AMOLED displays are great, maybe the best in the business! But the vibrant colors and screen brightness might seem a bit unusual, especially for users coming from IPS displays. </p>
<p> So, if the screen on your new Galaxy A50 appears too bright, it’s just the way Samsung AMOLED displays work and should look. However, you can still adjust some settings to make the screen more appealing to your eyes. </p>
<p> Just go to settings, and change the screen mode to Basic. Even if you’re not satisfied with the end result, give it some time for your eyes and brain to get accustomed to the new vibrant screen. </p>
<p> That’s about it. If you’ve encountered a problem I didn’t list in this article or you have some additional questions, write it down in the comments below, and we’ll try to find the solution together. </p>

<p> Every time I use the phone, after a few minutes a screen pops up wanting to scan for Bluetooth device. Bluetooth settings set to off and do not scan. You have to clear this screen off before you can access key pad or end call. This is very annoying. Samsung doesn’t know how to fix the problem. They want me to take my new phone to a repair center. Anyone else having this problem? </p>

<p> My question is why in the hell would they bother putting this garbage in the phone instead of a rear sensor if it doesn’t work correctly? At least they’re reliable and superior IMO since you actually know your finger is on it correctly. Tactile feel any day over this in screen nonsense. What benefit is there to it? Oh right, novelty and they’re running out new features to carry on the obsolescence in this bloated market of garbage. </p>
<p> Totally agree. The scanner is useless on my phone too. Having paid £300 for this A50 I’m disappointed especially with low ram (4gb) </p>

<p> Sir my a50 has screen flickering problem. What should i do?? Is it caused by softerware problem or hardware? </p>
<p> my samsung A50phone is acting crazy. this has been going on for 5days. It comes on and off when it wants, its shuts off in the middle of a text or call.why would samsung put out a phone with so many people complaining? this is a wasted expense. Can someone from Samsung address these concerns. Bestbuy you need to address this as you retailed this piece of junk to me. Very angry customer </p>

<p> Why doesn’t alarm automatically come on if phone is off, if u have set alarm surely it should come on even if phone is off??? Am I missing something??? </p>
<p> I switched from the Huawei p smart 2019 after it has a manufacturing fault with the front cam seal and as Google had dropped them didn’t want to risk it on another. I have to say other than the cam issue I didn’t have any other gripes. Since getting the a50 I’ve noticed everyone of the issues mentioned above (hence how I found your article). For a phone which cost 80 euros more I’m kinda disappointed. </p>

<p> Redmi Note 8 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Xiaomi doesn’t play around and the output of devices they introduce yearly is crazy for all industry standards. Not even 8 months after the Chinese giant introduced the Redmi Note 7 (and its variations, 7S and 7 Pro), the Redmi Note 8 (along with 8 Pro and 8T) have hit the market. </p>
<p> This appears to be a great device, just like its predecessor, with the Penta-camera (if we include the selfie cam) setup being the major upgrade over the Redmi Note 7. The device has its flaws but they are hard not to look over considering the price point of Note 8. </p>
<p> Today, we made sure to provide you with the list of the most common Redmi Note 8 issues with applicable solutions. If you have any problems with the device, continue reading below or just jump to a section of your interest. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Touchscreen is laggy </p>
<p> Some users reported that the touchscreen (display) is laggy and that was later identified as a software issue on the official global ROM. In our knowledge, the problem is dealt with on later updates. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, if the display is laggy or animations are slow, make sure to follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > My device > System and check for updates. Install an update if available. </p>
<p> Enable Developer options (Settings > My device > All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number). Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options and disable MIUI Optimization at the bottom. </p>
<p> Get back in Developer options and reduce Animation from 1 to 0.5. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings (the procedure is explained at the bottom of this article). </p>
<p> 2. Battery drain issues </p>
<p> Although the 4000 mAh battery should be big enough to give the Redmi Note 8 an exquisite Screen-on Time, users are reporting issues with battery drains. There are multiple things that might affect battery life but, when it comes to MIUI-powered devices, our first suspect is a lack of optimization on the current ROM. </p>
<p> Updates cause battery drains and new updates usually solve them. So, first of all, make sure that your Redmi Note 8 is up to date in regards to the firmware. After that, you can check these tips to reduce battery drains significantly: </p>
<p> Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Disable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and individually disable Autostart on apps. </p>
<p> Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery. </p>
<p> 3. SIM card won’t activate </p>
<p> Moving on, there are reports about the SIM card not working. Namely, it seems that the SIM card won’t activate on this handset for some European and Asian users. Now, we need you to ensure that your device is on the Global MIUI ROM where all necessary bands are available. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, try reinserting the SIM card into the alternative socket and try again. Make sure to reboot your device after doing so. If the problem is still persistent, update the firmware or reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> There’s a slight chance that we are looking at the manufacturing defect, so you can also contact your retailer for service. </p>
<p> 4. Notification icons not showing </p>
<p> Missing notifications on MIUI is probably the longest-running problem Xiaomi/Redmi users experienced. The fact that someone at their software development department decided that it’s a good idea for notification icons to disappear after a few seconds from the Status bar is preposterous. </p>
<p> Luckily, you don’t have to worry about that the moment MIUI gets available. Which already is, although based on Android 9 Pie instead of Android 10. </p>
<p> The problem with notifications is completely solved on MIUI 11, but if you are still not seeing notification icons, here’s how to enable them with ease: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open Display. </p>
<p> Select Notch & status bar. </p>
<p> Under the Status bar section, enable Show icons for incoming notifications. </p>
<p> 5. Low sound volume on headphones </p>
<p> This is also quite a common occurrence, especially on wireless (Bluetooth) headphones or buds. Users say that the volume on their headphones is not high at all, even on the highest settings. Seemingly, there is a workaround to it and we already wrote about it, here. </p>
<p> What you need to do is toggle on the Disable absolute volume option in the Developer options menu. </p>
<p> An alternative is to tweak audio output with certain Magisk modules, which requires root. We don’t recommend that approach if you are not experienced with modding ROMs. </p>
<p> 6. Google Assistant not working </p>
<p> Another quite common problem reported on various forums concerns Google Assistant that won’t work on the Redmi Note 8. The Voice Match for Google Assistant’s voice commands appears greyed out for some users. </p>
<p> This problem seems to be related to MIUI, both 10 and 11, and we don’t have any official response by Xiaomi. There are some things you can try in order to resolve this but, as we said already, this is a widespread issue and, until Xiaomi resolves the problem with their OS skin, we can mainly wait. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to try and solve Google Assistant not working on Redmi Note 8: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Google and clear cache and data. </p>
<p> Leave the Google Beta program from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Uninstall Google updates and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings > Apps > Manage apps. Tap on the 3-dot menu and open Default apps. From there, open Assist & voice input. Under the Assist app, select Google. </p>
<p> Delete and retrain the Voice model. </p>
<p> 7. The Call recording option is missing </p>
<p> This isn’t a bug or anything similar. Namely, due to rules in different regions and in accordance with Google’s privacy regulations (they paid a hefty fee for privacy infringement case), Xiaomi won’t deliver their Contacts and dialer app with an option to record calls. This option is not allowed in Europe and various other regions around the globe. </p>
<p> So, if you badly want this option, consider unlocking the bootloader and flashing either an official ROM from supported regions or flashing Xiaomi EU ROM that has it. </p>
<p> 8. Delay on Lock Screen </p>
<p> This can fall into the overall lag issues with the device but we decided to give it a separate spot on the list. Namely, some users have said that there’s an unexpected 4 seconds delay when they are on the Lock Screen and just after unlocking the device. </p>
<p> For the time being, we don’t have many insights to offer but you can try disabling Tap to wake and disabling the double-press Power button to start a camera. Alternatively, you should ensure that the firmware is up to date or reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 9. GCAM not working on Note 8 </p>
<p> One of the best things about the Redmi Note 8 is that it supports Google Camera ports without rooting your device. Although you won’t be able to utilize all lenses with GCAM, the standard mode photography along with the Night Mode are much better than on the stock camera app. </p>
<p> However, since the device is (still) new, users run into a lot of GCAM ports that crash or won’t work in certain mods. We recommend downloading the GCAM from an acknowledged developer, here. </p>
<p> Just make sure to, before you run the app for the first time, clear all cache and data. That will prevent crashes. </p>
<p> 10. Tips: How to wipe cache partition or factory reset Redmi Note 8 </p>
<p> Finally, we made sure to provide you with two valuable procedures that, if things go awry, might help you get your device in the working condition again. </p>
<p> Here’s how to wipe cache partition on Redmi Note 8 and solve certain issues: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> And this is how to reset your device to factory settings: </p>
<p> Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> Additionally, if you dislike bloatware that comes with MIUI, we have just the right article for you. Learn how to easily debloat your Redmi Note 8 with the steps explained here. No unlocking bootloader or root needed. </p>
<p> With that side note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and we hope this piece shed some light on issues you experienced.

Am i the only one who’s getting this problem? Has anybody a soulution? </p>

<p> Is there anyone that can help me? I just got the Redmi Note 8 a couple days ago. It’s my first time with MiUi so I’m kind of confused on how it works. It took a few hours and to factory resets to get notification sounds. I’m pretty much set up the way I want it but cannot move icons to another page. When I install an app it creates a new page and I can’t move the icon where I want it. In short, I can’t arrange my apps as I’d prefer, remove unwanted pages, and organize my phone.… Read more » </p>
<p> Hi, Bobby. Hm, if you can’t move apps on the Home screen, make sure that they are not locked in the Launcher settings. Tap and hold on an empty area of your screen. You should see 3 options at the bottom: Wallpaper, Widgets, and Settings. Open Settings. Then just toggle off the “Lock Home screen layout”. Alternatively, you can download a third-party launcher from the Play Store (Poco launcher should do) and run it instead of the default launcher. It might be easier to use. </p>

<p> Fix: Gboard keeps crashing on Android </p>
<p> All the praises to some third-party keyboards, but there are good reasons why the majority of Android users go for the Gboard – the Google Keyboard. Once you set it up, it’s quite intuitive and, more importantly, stable. However, there are users that report certain issues. For some of them, Gboard keeps crashing, sometimes even when it’s not in use. </p>
<p> If you are among affected users, we have a few steps to help you address this without too much effort. </p>
<p> What to do if Gboard keeps stopping? </p>
<p> First of all, reboot your device once. After that, make sure that the problem isn’t in the third-party gesture app that might, accidentally, close Gboard while typing. </p>
<p> If Gboard keeps crashing despite those two steps, move through our list of 4 solutions to fix it for good. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Ensure that Google Gboard is your default keyboard </p>
<p> First of all, make sure that Google Keyboard is your default keyboard. There are many reports about crashes caused by a conflict between the system keyboard (e.g. Samsung Keyboard vs Gboard). That’s why you need to ensure that Gboard is the default keyboard on your device. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to set Google Keyboard as the default keyboard on your Android device: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Select Languages & input. </p>
<p> Under the Current keyboard, select Gboard. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear cache and data </p>
<p> The next step is to clear the cache and the data from the Gboard. Namely, there’s a slight chance that the locally-stored files are causing issues with Gboard. To circumvent that possibility and reset Gboard, you should clear both cache and data. </p>
<p> Here’s how to clear cache and data from Gboard on Android: </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Select All apps (Manage apps or App manager). </p>
<p> Open Gboard. </p>
<p> Clear cache first and then clear data. Have in mind that this will reset Gboard settings. </p>
<p> Restart your phone or tablet. </p>
<p> If the Gboard keeps crashing, move to the next step. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reinstall Gboard or uninstall updates </p>
<p> In case the previous steps failed to resolve the problem, you can try and reinstall the app. If your device came with the pre-installed Gboard as the system keyboard, you can at least uninstall updates, restart your device, and allow Gboard to update again to the latest version. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Select All apps (Manage apps or App manager). </p>
<p> Tap Advanced > App Details. It’ll take you to Gboard’s Play Store page/ </p>
<p> Uninstall the app. </p>
<p> Install the app again from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> If Gboard comes with the system, navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Gboard and uninstall updates there. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Enroll in the Gboard Beta program or install older APK </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps resolved the problem with repetitive Gboard crashes, we have two more things to recommend. </p>
<p> The first one is to navigate to Gboard on the Play Store and enroll in the Beta program. Many users who are beta testers for the app claim that it is, believe it or not, frequently more stable than the public version. I personally do have a Beta version and have never run into any issues. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can navigate to APK Mirror, here, or any other APK hub that aggregates APKs for sideloading. Once there, download and install (sideload) an older version of Gboard. After that, the app shouldn’t keep crashing anymore. </p>
<p> With that said, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and, in case you have any questions or suggestions (possibly alternative solutions), make sure to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> I tried the first 2 solutions. Still wouldn’t work, getting discouraged. Solution 3 (uninstall updates) fixed it. Thank you! My only suggestion for dummies like me is to specify exactly how to uninstall updates once you’ve gotten to settings>apps>all apps>Gboard. You say “uninstall updates there”. I looked and looked and looked for a button to do just that, getting desperate, finally noticed an unidentified symbol in the top right corner that, when tapped, gave me the option I wanted. Again, thanks a million. What a relief! </p>

<p> and if your phone is locked???!! and you need the keyboard to type your password….. it’s more than 6 hours that i’m trying to fix my gboard! when i will manage to lock in i will send my feedback! awful! </p>
<p> Hi there, I am having the same problem today. Any luck fixing and if so, what did you do? I have switched phone off and on, rebooted etc sent feedback via computer as can’t do a thing on the phone. </p>
<p> I was able to update gboard and (gboard) keyboard came back after successful update. I’d imagine those who have a character password unlock should switch over to pattern unlock. this is the 3rd time gboard failed my motorola droid rzr II. 1st time was character entry, had to reset phone, that time. I must have been pushed an update 2 days ago that wiped the gboard permissions. It was still installed, just corrupted. </p>

<p> How to solve Facebook Android app crashes </p>
<p> Issues with both the Facebook app and Messenger app aren’t a rarity on Android mobile devices. For some users, they are an everyday struggle, even though they shouldn’t be. However, let’s not cry over spilled milk, but rather try to fix the issues users encounter on a daily basis. One of those issues is app crashing. The Facebook app seems to crash unexpectedly and it’s hard to find out the exact reason. The problem especially occurs after the system update. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we enlisted solutions, in hope to help you resolve it. You can find the list below. </p>
<p> Update Facebook app </p>
<p> The first step you should take is somewhat a leap of faith. Namely, you’ll need to rely on the possible fix for the crash issue in the latest update. If it’s available, of course. Your phone may do the job for you with the automatic update, but in case you’ve disabled it, make sure to check these steps for the manual update. </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Tap Menu. </p>
<p> Search for Facebook in the Update list. </p>
<p> If the crashes are gone you’re good to go. However, if the problems are still there, let’s move to the firmware. </p>
<p> Update Android </p>
<p> On some occasions (rare occasions, to be perfectly honest), you can repair your app-related issues with the new firmware. Basically, some of the crashes appear after the major software update. So, in order to resolve any invoked issues, the developers shortly patch the issues with the small fixes. So, you should just in case, check for the available updates for your device. And this is how: </p>
<p> Enable Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Move down and tap System update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> If the update is available, tap Download & Install. </p>
<p> Make sure that your battery is at least at the 30% before updating. </p>
<p> If the Facebook app still crashes, move up to the next step on the list. </p>
<p> Clear Facebook app cache and data </p>
<p> Another thing worth checking is also one of the best-known Facebook app’s drawbacks – unreasonable storing of the considerable amount of data and cache. What you should do is clear the cache and data, and check for changes in the app’s behavior. Hopefully, with that move, you’ll remove possible slowdowns that are a known culprit for this issue. This is how to clear cache and data from the Facebook app: </p>
<p> Tap Apps. </p>
<p> Navigate to Facebook app. </p>
<p> Tap to open Options. </p>
<p> Restart your device and try out Facebook app again. </p>
<p> If the sudden crashes are still there, the reinstallation is the next obvious step. </p>
<p> Reinstall the Facebook app </p>
<p> Well, with the reinstallation you should get the latest version and clean cache/data in a more manageable manner. However, you’ll need to set up your preferences again after the reinstallation is completed. This is how to manage Facebook reinstallation process: </p>
<p> Tap and hold the Facebook app and move it to the top of the screen to uninstall it. </p>
<p> Enable Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Tap Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for Facebook. </p>
<p> However, if the current version is malfunctioning on your device and the previous was working just fine, check the next step. </p>
<p> Download older Facebook app version </p>
<p> If you’re keen to use Facebook’s official app but the latest changes made havoc, you can download an APK and use older app’s versions. It’s easier if your phone is rooted, but it doesn’t matter if it isn’t. Follow these steps to obtain and install an earlier version of the Facebook app: </p>
<p> Download the wanted version’s APK here on your PC. </p>
<p> Extract the file until you have the APK file. </p>
<p> Connect the Android device to the PC via USB and transfer the APK file to internal memory. </p>
<p> Uninstall the current Facebook app and restart your device. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced settings > Security, and enable Unknown sources. </p>
<p> Use File Explorer or a similar app to navigate to the folder where the APK file is stored. </p>
<p> Tap to install the APK with the older version. </p>
<p> After the process is finished, make sure not to install updates for the Facebook app. </p>
<p> But, in case you’re over your head with the shenanigans of the official Facebook app, you still have an alternative to access your favorite social network. </p>
<p> Use an alternative wrapper apps </p>
<p> A lot of people decided that enough is enough and switched to ‘wrappers’, the 3rd-party alternatives that have similar features like the original app but with better performance and optimization. However, that comes at the cost. Some of them have ads and you’ll need the Pro version to get rid of them. On the other hand, others may be too feature-slim for someone’s taste. But, most of the time, with the wrapper, you can get rid of Facebook Messenger, too. Two birds with the one stone. </p>
<p> Additionally, you can log into Facebook via a browser, like Chrome, Opera, or Mozilla. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings </p>
<p> At the end, if you’ve developed some kind of emotion for the official Facebook app, you can try and perform factory settings. This is the last step and too often it’s not worth performing. Namely, as you already know, with the factory reset you lost all of your data. All that effort put in the hope that, after the fresh system starts, your Facebook will work as intended. More times than not, it won’t help you. </p>
<p> However, if you’re keen to try it out, this is how to reset your Android device to factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Tap Factory data reset. </p>
<p> After that, the phone will restart and, the next time it starts, all settings and data will be renewed. Now you can download the Facebook (if it’s not already preinstalled on your device), and check for changes. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. The Facebook app crashes are not exactly something you would expect from the premium developers working for Facebook. However, maybe they’ll reassure us in the near future. </p>
<p> What is your experience with the Facebook app? Do you have any alternative solutions for crashes issue? </p>
<p> Make sure to tell us in the comments. We’ll appreciate it. </p>

I have uninstalled, reinstalled, turned off device, reset to factory reset, reinstalled Facebook and messenger, worked fine, but after I restarted my phone Facebook crashed again. Removed, reinstalled no changes at all. What to do more? I had to reinstall all apps, but issue still persist. I really need help. What to do more? </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/change-clock-format-on-samsung-s8-lock-screen/comment-page-1" parent_folder="web1" id="file17845616" filename="comment-page-1">
<p> Tip: How to change stack up clock format on Samsung Galaxy S8 lock screen </p>
<p> Just as everyone expected, Samsung Galaxy S8 took the market by the storm. It’s extremely well designed and produced, with the plethora of amazing novelties and great software to complete the picture. But, as some would say, the devil is in details. </p>
<p> One detail that somewhat corrupted the overall experience is the positioning of the lock screen clock. Namely, it seems that, by default, the numbers layout is stacked up, minutes above hours. That layout isn’t what most users are used to and they want to change it to standard form. But, as the case has shown, that’s harder to do than we expected. Don’t mix up the Always On Display with the lock screen, though. In Always on Display feature, you can customize the clock to your liking. The Lock screen is a completely different story. </p>
<p> Either way, we prepared some alternatives, or rather workarounds that should help you change the clock’s layout. At least, for the time being. If you’re not satisfied with the digital clock format on your Samsung Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus, make sure to check them out below. </p>
<p> Use different theme </p>
<p> Some users managed to get rid of the unusual clock by replacing the default theme for an alternative. This, of course, isn’t a solution but rather a workaround that might not be suiting everyone’s taste. However, for the time being, there are not so many things you can do, so it’s worth a try. There are some paid themes, but, since we can’t be sure that, after certain steps, the stack up format won’t return, it’s not advised to spend your money on those. </p>
<p> On the other hand, you can use a free theme and make your clock take a normal position that way. Follow the instructions below to do so: </p>
<p> Open Wallpapers and themes. </p>
<p> Tap Themes in the bottom. </p>
<p> Search for Simple Line Black theme. </p>
<p> Moreover, if you’re not liking icon and background changes, you can always choose other wallpaper and restore icons to default. Make sure to check the steps below in order to change the wallpaper on both Home and Lock screen and restore default icons. </p>
<p> Navigate to Gallery and choose the preferred photo individually for Home or Lock screen. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Set as wallpaper. </p>
<p> Now, navigate to Settings. </p>
<p> Open Wallpapers and themes. </p>
<p> Choose Icons. </p>
<p> Tap Default and apply changes. </p>
<p> Try an app that sticks notifications the on lock screen </p>
<p> On the other hand, most of the users are already satisfied with the pre-installed theme and all they want to change is that silly annoyance of the lock screen clock. Or rather, make it vertical like on all Android-powered devices. But, until Samsung fix this and provide users with an option to choose the clock looks (just like in Always on Display features), there’s one, so to say, loophole you can take advantage of. Namely, if Lock screen notifications are enabled, you can place something like weather app to stick on the screen. </p>
<p> Due to its position, the clock changes its format to standard vertical positioning. If that works for you, it’s quite easy to set it up. In the example below, we’ll be using a weather app, called 1Weather. It’s small and subtle but will change your clock to a vertical position. </p>
<p> Enable Notifications. </p>
<p> As long as the notification stays on the Lock Screen, the annoying row-like position should be out of the picture. </p>
<p> That’s it. Since there are so many users that are complaining about this, we can expect that Samsung will do something in the upcoming period. Some of the future updates should change the clock to more natural state. Until then, you can use the above-mentioned workarounds. </p>
<p> In case you have questions or suggestions, make sure to post them in the comments section down below. </p>

<p> To change the digital clock on the lock screen: They have a couple of clock styles to choose from. </p>
<p> “Settings” > “Lock Screen and Security” > TAP the “Always On Display” (like the words, not the switch) > TAP “Digital Clock” (or the other clock styles if you want analog or something) > on the bottom left there’s “Clock Styles” which give 4 different digital clock styles to choose from. </p>
<p> Or you can choose the other clock styles outside of the digital clock section. </p>

<p> Huawei P10 Lite common issues, and how to resolve them </p>
<p> Huawei’s enormous growth is well-justified by the devices they delivered in the last few years. It’s only the question of time before they get to contest first place with Apple or Samsung. And latest flagship ”P” handsets are definitely a step forward in many regards. </p>
<p> Even though P10 Lite isn’t on the same level as P10 and P10 plus flagships, it’s an amazing mid-range handset that rewards users with a slick design, great IPS LCD screen and overall above-average performance. It comes with the latest version of Huawei Android variation, EMUI 5.1, and to date, P10 Lite received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, after some time, issues started to pile up. Don’t get us wrong, this is is the case with most other devices and the problems we enlisted below aren’t common and widespread. But, if you have any issues with your latest acquisition, make sure to check the list below and look up for a solution. </p>
<p> Battery drainage </p>
<p> Huawei is not known for fast battery drainage on previous devices, but, it seems that the latest addition to P lite series is somewhat troubled in that regard. With the 3000 mAh, P10 Lite battery doesn’t lack longevity, at least if you’re not an intensive user. Fast charging is a great improvement over P9 and will let you recharge much faster. However, it seems that the EMUI 5.1 kind of drains more battery than EMUI 5.0 and the more demanding screen is a greater consumer, too. </p>
<p> Some users reported that the battery life is underwhelming, so we prepared some tips for you to improve it. If you’re unsure what to do, the steps below should be informative. </p>
<p> Disable power-consuming background apps. You can do that within the Phone Manager > Lock Screen Cleanup. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location Mode, and choose Device only if you’re not in need of GPS’s high accuracy at the moment. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location > 3-dot Menu > Scan settings, and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, respectively. </p>
<p> Reset phone in Safe mode and look for changes. If the battery life is much longer, that would imply that some 3rd-party app is hogging on your battery. Most of the time, the problem is resolved by uninstalling lately installed apps. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Disable Auto brightness and set a preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Slow speed and lag </p>
<p> In the hardware department, P10 Lite is probably one of the best-buy models in the mid-range category. It’s fast and reliable as they come. However, the occasional issues with performance aren’t unusual. Some of them reported freezes after unlocking while others have had experienced performance drops while running some demanding games. </p>
<p> Even the manufacturer said that the eMMC memory instead of faster UFS. That’s just like that. Another thing that might affect performance drops is related to overheating which we will address below. </p>
<p> If you’ve experienced something similar, there are some things you can do to resolve the issue. </p>
<p> Restart your device. If it won’t react to standard Power Off procedure, you can force shut down by holding the Power button long enough. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. Follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Let the phone cool down for a while. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> SIM card issues </p>
<p> Just as the previous iterations in P Lite series, P10 Lite supports either dual-SIM or SIM + SD card variation. Now, it’s not exactly hard to set up preferred cards in the compartment, but there are some things to know. Firstly, only the primary SIM card supports 3G and above technologies. Second is exclusively bound to 2G. So, if you’ve experienced connection losses or a network coverage error, make sure to check which card you use. </p>
<p> In addition, you should double check is everything set as intended before the suspicion of hardware malfunction arises. In addition, you can restart your device and look for changes. After that, you shouldn’t have any problems with the SIM card. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issue </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues were not uncommon for Huawei handsets before, and they are still present for some users of P10 Lite. Some of them reported connectivity issues while trying to pair their phone with the car media board or a wireless headset. For some, the connection is unstable and crashing frequently, while others weren’t able to connect in the first place. Firstly, you must make sure that the P10 Lite is the culprit for the failed pairing. Check connection with multiple devices to make sure that the phone is the problem. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, follow the instructions below to resolve the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Make sure that the Airplane mode is disabled. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Clear pairing and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Try disabling Wi-Fi and Mobile Data while using Bluetooth. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, you should contact your vendor or responsible carrier since the problem is certainly hardware-related. </p>
<p> Fingerprint scanner issues </p>
<p> The fingerprint scanner is more than a useful feature on flagship devices. But, lately, even the mid-range devices are packing reader with a variety of nifty uses. And Huawei is one of the first large manufacturers that started implementing fingerprint reader on the majority of its devices. The scanner on Huawei P10 Lite is just as fast and well-placed like on P9. But, there’s still a problem or two regarding its occasional erratic behavior. </p>
<p> There are some workarounds you can apply before concurring that the hardware is the problem. </p>
<p> Clean your fingerprint scanner. Use a wet cloth to clean the fingerprint scanner of dirt. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable fingerprint gestures. Open Settings > Fingerprint ID, and disable all gestures except the standard unlock feature. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> In the end, if the problem is persistent, contact your vendor or carrier and report the problem. </p>
<p> Volume issues </p>
<p> Certain users reported issues with the sound volume of certain apps notifications and many other aspects, with the exclusion of ringer sound that works as intended. Namely, some of them reported too loud or quiet notifications and other multimedia features. And even though they tried to regulate or even mute the sound, it still remained the same. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to wait for the future update which should resolve the sound bug. Meanwhile, you can use the ”Do not disturb” mode to disable certain sounds. In addition, try some of these workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Boot in safe mode. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC with HiSuite. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> Overheating issues </p>
<p> Another problem that emerged with the introduction of massive hardware improvements is the overheating. And most of the modern smartphones will eventually get hot, but some of them are more prone to it than others. Huawei P10 Lite, for example, is prone to overheating. Especially in the upper back part. Don’t get us wrong, this occurrence requires certain circumstances, like intensive gaming or exposure to the sun for an extended period, or use during charging. </p>
<p> Because of that, make sure to keep your phone far from the heat sources and leave it be while fast charging. In addition, don’t use alternative, commercial chargers instead of the one OEM provided you with. </p>
<p> Moreover, if the device overheating occurs during the idle state or standard use, make sure to take it for repair or ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Besides the Bluetooth issue, there are additional problems that are also related to connectivity. Namely, some users reported poor Wi-Fi signal or constant disconnection while using P10 Lite. In addition, others are experiencing poor connection while using Mobile data. There are so many factors for this occurrence, and many of those are not exclusively phone-related. </p>
<p> We enlisted some of the probable solutions for the problem and you can find them just below. </p>
<p> Mobile Data troubleshooting: </p>
<p> Switch Network type. Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. Go to Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Forget network and re-establish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz. It lacks range, but it’s a more stable option. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition within Recovery settings. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> After that, your connectivity issues should be long gone. In contrary, if those steps failed to resolve the issue at hand, make sure to report the problem to service or to manufacturer support itself. </p>
<p> That should be it. If you have any additional problems or alternative solutions for the ones presented, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi A2 known issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> The affordable devices are indeed getting competitive. After Xiaomi Mi A1 had a lot of success, the successor was expected. And that successor comes in another Android One handset called, you guessed, Mi A2. Overall, this device is one of the best in the market in its range, as it offers plenty of goods for a budget price. However, there are some minor isolated Xiaomi Mi A2 issues and we made sure to bring them out and provide solutions. </p>
<p> This is a great handset but if you’re stuck with a problem, the list below should help you address it. The explanation for the more complex troubleshooting steps can be found at the bottom of this article. </p>
<p> 1: Touchscreen latency issue </p>
<p> Let’s start with the screen. This seems to apply to multiple recently-introduced Xiaomi handsets. Namely, users experienced problems with a ghost touch, unresponsive multitouch, or touchscreen latency. These are a mixed bag, as sometimes the problem occurs due to hardware, while other times the software is doing a bad job. </p>
<p> Since the problem commonly appears while gaming (mostly in PUBG), we can safely assume that there are some tweaks you can try out and resolve the problem. </p>
<p> Remove the tempered glass. </p>
<p> Run the device in a safe mode. </p>
<p> 2: Battery consumption issue </p>
<p> This is one of the rare downsides of the Mi A2. The battery capacity is barely enough to feed the large LCD display and the Snapdragon 660. This, of course, substantially affects the Screen-On-Time on this device. However, this 3000 mAh is not as bad as one would assume. But, the heavy depletion during the idle mode is something which is certainly unusual. </p>
<p> For that reason, we have a few tips for you which should help you extend the battery life on the Mi A2: </p>
<p> Open Developer options and disable Mobile Data always on. </p>
<p> Prevent some secondary apps from working in the background. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth overnight. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Use Greenify or any other third-party application to limit the background processes. </p>
<p> 3: Bluetooth bug issue </p>
<p> Due to a fact that the Mi A2 comes without the 3.5-inch headphone jack, you’ll either need to use an adapter or Bluetooth headphones. And the latter option seems to be a difficulty for some users, as the Bluetooth won’t work as specified. Supposedly, the Bluetooth either disconnects frequently or users are unable to connect in the first place. </p>
<p> We have a few ways you can tackle this, and make sure to check them out below: </p>
<p> Remove pairing and establish it again. Navigate to Settings >Bluetooth and delete all paired devices. Pair the handset with the device again and try again. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Disable Automatic pairing. Pair individually with a device when you want to use it. </p>
<p> Boot into a safe mode and try connecting via Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Update the system. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> 4: Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Wi-Fi on this device is not exactly the fastest. In addition, it has a short reach so the connection tends to slow down gradually the further you’re from the router. Additionally, users had a hard time connecting to a 5 GHz wireless band. Besides those, the connection is unstable and disconnecting is a common thing for some users. </p>
<p> There’s only so much one can do in regards to the aforementioned problems, but we can try and improve the Wireless connection a bit. Here’s what you can try: </p>
<p> Delete all networks and try reconnecting. </p>
<p> Disable Always On for Mobile Data in Developer options. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Reset App preferences. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Network Settings </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 5: Slow RAM </p>
<p> If you look it up, there are more than enough signs that the RAM on the Mi A2 is rather slow. That’s, seemingly, not the case for all users but some who had run the benchmark tests with Antutu had quite underwhelming results. </p>
<p> This might be a temporary bug and it should be addressed in one of the future updates. In addition, make sure to disable everything in the background before you run the RAM benchmark test. </p>
<p> 6: Signal reception issue </p>
<p> As some reports state, the cellular signal reception was nice until the September security update. Then it dropped down considerably and this can affect the call quality. This also can lead to a major HSDPA or 4G spikes or disconnections. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do to fix this problem: </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Check the SIM card placement. Make sure the SIM card is active. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> Delete Access Points in Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile network. The default carrier Acess Point should appear so assign it and look for changes. </p>
<p> 7: Videos reproduction issue </p>
<p> The problem with the video reproduction when streaming videos or playing from a local storage seems to be the thing. The videos come out grainy or pixelated and that’s also the case after the September security update. </p>
<p> In order to address this, we suggest taking some of these steps: </p>
<p> Clear the cache from the app (e.g. YouTube, Twitch etc.). </p>
<p> Disable Adaptive brightness. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Update the device. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 8: Lags and freezes </p>
<p> This handset offers one of the best CPUs in the rank, with the Snapdragon 660 being a display of power and consistency. However, that’s not always the case and we have software to blame for that. Or overheating. </p>
<p> Either way, the reported issues mostly occur during the gaming sessions, and we all know that some of the modern games can be really demanding. However, lags in the user interface and in the resource-easy apps shouldn’t be a thing, and that’s where we suggest some tweaks. </p>
<p> Here’s what you can do to speed up the Mi A2 and reduce lags and stutters: </p>
<p> Clear cache from the app which freezes the most. </p>
<p> Disable apps from working in the background. Greenify should serve the purpose. </p>
<p> Update your device for a possible update fix. </p>
<p> Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 9: Random Reboots </p>
<p> When we collect the data and write these kinds of ample issue roundups, we tend to avoid the custom ROM issues. Flashing ROMs on their own is already a journeymen action and the issues which might occur are probably well-known to all advanced users. So, the random reboots occur mostly when the stock Android ROM is replaced by the custom ROM. </p>
<p> So, if you’ve done something similar, we suggest reflashing the stock ROM and sticking with it for some time. This device is more than interesting for the developer’s community and we’re sure that soon we’ll have stable versions of all fan-favorite custom ROMs. Including the MIUI port for Mi A2. </p>
<p> 10: Yellowish screen tint </p>
<p> The thing with the LCD screens is that they don’t have the same warmth. Some are more bluish while others tend to be yellowish. And that’s the thing, check it up. Two devices with the same product number might have a different LCD display and thus the disparity between the LCD temperature. </p>
<p> In the Xiaomi’s case, there are two different LCD displays with code names Tianma and Illitek (their respective manufacturers). Tianma is cooler while Ilitek is warmer. You can check which is placed on your device by dialing “##6484##“. </p>
<p> With that in mind, you can also check whether your Nightlight is turned on and disable it. It might be the reason for the yellow tint we’re referring to. </p>
<p> 11: GPS issues </p>
<p> The GPS issues are rare on the Mi A2. And judged on the results of many reviewers and user reports, the GPS is quite precise on this AndroidOne handset. However, sometimes it stops working for an unknown reason and that’s observable when using Google Maps, Waze or similar apps which are dependent on GPS to determine your location. </p>
<p> On the other hand, the problem might be of general nature and not specific for Mi A2. In order to resolve it, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Reboot the device. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> 12: Overheating issue </p>
<p> Overheating is another general problem, a problem which is common for all devices with powerful chipsets. In addition, Mi A2 utilizes Quick Charge 3.0 which will charge your battery fast but will heat up the device a bit. And, that’s why using your handset while charging isn’t the best idea. </p>
<p> Also, we suggest removing the casing if you enjoy intensive gaming, as this will also work towards the higher working temperature. </p>
<p> 13: Black Screen in some apps </p>
<p> Some users also experienced black screens in certain third-party apps. While one group had a black boxes pop-up randomly on the screen, for others the whole screen went black (e.g. official Twitter app). There seems to be a bug at hand and seemingly, the September update fixed this. </p>
<p> However, if the problem persists and it tackles only one app you can single out, follow these steps to try and resolve this: </p>
<p> Reinstall the app. </p>
<p> Allow the required app’s permissions. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> 14: Adaptive brightness issue </p>
<p> The Adaptive Brightness and the behavior of the ambient light sensor are touchy subjects when it comes to Xiaomi’s Android One handsets. These are scarce problems but some users had a hard time with the automatic adaptive brightness which is underperforming. </p>
<p> For that reason, we have a few suggestions for you which should help you improve it: </p>
<p> Disable Adaptive brightness and restart your device. Re-enable it again. </p>
<p> Clean the front-facing top bezel where the sensor resides. </p>
<p> 15: The device doesn’t receive OTA updates </p>
<p> And, finally, the last place is reserved for the alleged inability to get the OTA updates on Mi A2. Some users said that they haven’t got the August or September updates via Over-the-Air update protocol. </p>
<p> If that’s the case for you, try out some of these steps: </p>
<p> Check for updates manually. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Wait for some time. Your device might be assigned to another region and thus the delay in the OTA distribution. </p>
<p> That’s a wrap. If you know of any additional problems or have questions regarding the ones we posted, feel free to tell us in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. Thanks for reading. </p>

<p> How to clear Cache data in Android Oreo </p>
<p> Android Oreo has changed the way we clear cached data on our phones! Which left some users confused, as the process isn’t as straightforward and simple as it used to be in Android Nougat. </p>
<p> In Android Nougat, you could simply go to Storage settings, and bulk clear all the cache on your phone. That’s very practical, because users don’t have to bother clearing each app’s cache individually. A time-saving feature, we must say. </p>
<p> But that’s not the case anymore. When you go to Storage settings in Android Oreo, you won’t see this option anymore. That’s because Google decided to remove the traditional cache-clearing fature from Oreo. </p>
<p> So, how do we actually clear cache in Android Oreo now? </p>
<p> How is cached data cleared in Android Oreo </p>
<p> To understand what’s going on, we’ll have to include the whole picture. With Android O, Google wants to change the whole policy of using, storing, and clearing cached data. Google encourages developers to be more ‘efficient’ in developing their apps. </p>
<p> Here’s what the Android O developer preview release notes say: </p>
<p> “Android O gives better guidance and behaviors around cached data. Each app is now given a disk space quota for cached data…. </p>
<p> When the system needs to free up disk space, it will start by deleting cached files from apps that are the most over their allocated quota. Thus, if you [the developer of an app] keep your cached data under your allocated quota, your cached files will be some of the last on the system to be cleared when necessary. When the system is deciding what cached files to delete inside your app, it will consider the oldest files first (as determined by modified time).” </p>
<p> Of course, this is for the developer preview. But as it appears, nothing has changed in the official version. </p>
<p> So, long story short. You don’t need to clear cached data at all, as the system should do that for you. Because of that, there’s no cache partition, which will put all cached data in one place. </p>
<p> In theory, this looks pretty good, because the system should do all the work for you, when there’s need to free up disk space. But in practice, it might not function as flawless as Google imagines it. </p>
<p> Developers will need to change the code in their apps, and deliver proper updates to you. So, some time might pass until all your apps get updated, and that can cause troubles for your phone to properly manage the storage. We can only hope developers will deliver needed updates as soon as possible. </p>
<p> Clear cache for each app individually </p>
<p> Although the option to bulk clear your cached data on your phone is missing, you can still clear cache for each app individually, if you really want. And here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Storage </p>
<p> Navigate to Other apps </p>
<p> Now, tap on the app you want to clear cache for </p>
<p> Tap on Clear Cache </p>
<p> Use a third party app </p>
<p> Additionally, if you really want to buck clear cache on your Android phone, you can always use some third-party app. Some of the most popular apps for these purposes are CCleaner and Clean Master. But be careful, because some apps might actually slow down your device, or remove something you don’t want to be removed. So, just think about if it’s worth installing a third-party app for something your system would do on its own anyway. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope you understand the whole cache clearing philosophy better now. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, let me know in the comments, or reach me out on twitter. </p>

<p> I followed these directions. I have no “other apps”. I can’t find anything now with this stupid oreo update. I’m really hating these companies now. I’m hating technology right now. </p>
<p> I hate Oreo as well sucks says delete cache one app at a time but cache never deletes at all </p>

<p> With the beta release of Files Go you can clear the cache for all apps in one fell swoop. </p>
<p> Use Microsoft launcher. It doesn’t hang any way in my mind a1. Good laucher </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> Hi I’m using Zenfone 3 max 5.5 and everything was working fine until yesterday. I’m not able to connect to my mobile data, when I turn it on. nothing happens, I mean no indication that I’m connected or not even showing 3G/4G. tried reset factory and tried using safe mode. Still not working, is there any troubleshooting steps that I can do before going to the service center? </p>
<p> Hi, Chris. It’s hard to tell. Most of the times these issues appear due to a software bug. And since you’ve had performed a reset, it’s safe to tell that the problem is not software related. So, service center it is. </p>

<p> Today i was listening to music with my headphones (not the included ones) everything was fine…pulled them out…when i put them in a few hours later, my zenfone 3 didn’t notice i was putting in headphones and played the music on the speakers…. </p>
<p> Try plugging your headphones few times in and out. That’s a common bug and it’s easily resolvable by plug in/out procedure and a reset. If the problem is persistent, there are the alternative ways to address it. </p>

<p> Since last update I can’t unblock the phone. Says that pattern is not correct, I know it is correct, but the phone doesn’t recognise it. Also didn’t ask if I forgot my pattern. I don’t want to hard reset phone without considering other options. </p>
<p> Is there a chance you have a SIM card PIN? Have you tried some of the previous patterns you had used? That is a major problem, and it’s quite hard to resolve it without the complete wipe out of your phone. </p>

<p> My Asus zenfone 3 max 5.2 cannot focus on closer objects. What should I do? </p>
<p> I am also experiencing the same problem with my asus zenfone max 5.5. Prior to android nougat update, when you touch the screen, it automatically focuses on the object where you touched the screen. For near objects, it will produce a macro shot-like photo (which I loved). I have observed that in the settings, the focus mode set as smart-AF disappeared after the update </p>

<p> hi.. i having problem with the battery issues ZenFone 3 max.. when i charge the phone the battery will decrease while on mode. when the phone switch off the battery will increase.. can u help me how to solve my problem? </p>
<p> It’s hard to say, honestly. Some signs are leading towards the software bug that shows unprecise battery percentage. Others, well, are showing that your battery is malfunctioning. How old is your device? </p>

<p> having problem with mobile data.. after the last update, 1. cant receive any message on Messenger app 2. Facebook up not responding 3. Youtube keeps on loading 4. Chrome keeps on saying “reload page, check internet connection” 5. Mail app keep on loading.. however, playing online games using data is working so i believe that internet is not the issue .. Connecting to wifi is not an issue as well, uaing wifi connection, every apps mentioned earlier seems to work fine.. what should i do?? </p>
<p> Hello, Gab! Try resetting network settings or removing/inserting SIM card. Also, you should look for connection settings in the respective apps you’ve mentioned. Namely, some of the apps have restrictions on Mobile Data usage. Maybe the update made some uncalled changes. </p>
<p> hi gab! i have a problem also same that! until now i cant fixed it! i try this info if its is work! </p>

<p> Huawei Honor 8 most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei has gained a lot of popularity lately with both Mate (flagship) and Honor (mid-range) series. Honor 8 is the latest addition to the list of mid-budget devices produced by the Chinese company. Upon presentation for the US and EU market, the phone received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, even though Honor 8 offers good performance for an affordable price, there are some common issues worth mentioning. Users reported various problems with both hardware and software. It seems that the producer addressed some of the problems, but there is a large number of those that they need to resolve. Today we listed for you the known issues and possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Video crash while playing </p>
<p> As some of the users stated, the Honor 8 have a lot of issues with the video playback or streaming. It seems that the video crashes and, on some occasion, a restart is the only solution to get things work again. According to them, the crash occurs in online or offline videos, regardless. On the other hand, the fundament of the problem is YouTube. </p>
<p> We have noticed that the problem is widespread and the main culprit is integration with third-party apps. For the standard videos, first and foremost is to check the format. Honor 8 supports these video formats: </p>
<p> WMV </p>
<p> RM </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the online streaming videos are the ones with issues, make sure that you reinstall the given app or try an alternative. It seems that the Honor 8 have a certain level off incompatibility with some of them. Additionally, if the problem is persistent, you should contact customers support and ask for a replace. </p>
<p> Video recording stutter in third-party apps </p>
<p> While this is not as crushing (no pun intended) as the previous issue, it can be as annoying. Namely, many users reported lag and stutter while recording videos on Snapchat or Instagram story. This often leads to unsynchronized audio and video. </p>
<p> This seems to be related to awkward camera overheating. You should check the top of your phone for temperature changes. If the phone’s temperature is normal, try restarting your phone and clearing the app cache and data. Moreover, you can check your battery temperature by typing this code in your dialer *#*#2846579#*#*. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the phone is overheated (and that seems to happen often with some users), you’ll have to let it cool down. The camera behavior is not a strong feature of this model since the following default software is underwhelming. We’ll have to wait and see are there any fixes prepared in the next update build. </p>
<p> 3G works instead LTE, WiFI won’t connect </p>
<p> Connectivity is a common issue with the Honor 8. A large number of users reported problems related both to Wi-Fi and data networks. The phone won’t connect to a known network for ages or it chooses 3G instead of much faster LTE. </p>
<p> You can try following workarounds for data network issue: </p>
<p> Switch Network type: Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings: Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and reestablish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> The Huawei confirmed that they are aware of the Wi-Fi issue. We can hope that they’ll fix it with the next patch. </p>
<p> Echo while calling </p>
<p> Some users reported a problem with in-call speaker and mic malfunction. According to them, they hear the echo while speaking on the phone. The issue is more present when the loudspeaker is ON. </p>
<p> This is a common issue with many Android-powered phones. Most of the time it is related to pre-installed Google app called TalkBack. Our advice is to turn it off. </p>
<p> No battery percentage was shown </p>
<p> Honor 8 isn’t presenting battery percentage on the home screen by default. Most of the users are accustomed to that feature and they want to enable it but don’t know how. And this is the simplest way: </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon. </p>
<p> In the upper right corner, you’ll see 3 icons. </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon that is in the middle. </p>
<p> Notifications are not displayed when screen is off </p>
<p> Some of the users were left in disbelief when their push notifications from various apps stopped. It can be a quite annoying experience that ruins all-around impression about the phone. Which is pretty great in all manners. </p>
<p> Huawei made a strange decision to improve battery life by completely disabling the notifications while the screen is off. Luckily, that can be changed in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Protected apps. </p>
<p> Add apps that you want to receive notifications from. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this article helpful. Additionally, we are sure that the phone will function much better once it gets updated to Nougat 7.0. The update cycle started on 10th February so be sure to check your phones. </p>
<p> Are you experiencing any other issues? Be sure to tell us and we’ll give our best to help you. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> I’ve got one more question, is Honor 8 moisture resistant? Not water, moisture, because i left my phone for several hours in my room which gets ton of moisture if i forget to turn on heating, and when i came back my phone was ice cold and had alot o moisture on the screen, thanks </p>
<p> On paper – yes. But we advise you not to hold your phone in that kind of surrounding for an extended period of time. One or two times shouldn’t make a difference or cause any hardware malfunction. You’re welcome, we are always glad to help. </p>

<p> Could you please tell me where exactly do i find option to downgrade resolution from 1080p to 720p? As far as i know it is possible but i can’t find it… </p>
<p> You can use battery saving option and let your device downgrade the resolution in order to preserve the battery life. 1.Go to Settings. 2.Tap Battery. 3.Enable ROG Power Saving. </p>

<p> I have a sudden issue where my audio stops at no particular interval, I thought it was related to my spotify app but have noticed now with videos and my audible app also it’s driving me insane!! </p>
<p> Hello, Hazel. Make sure to check the permissions for those individual apps. Next, you can wipe cache partition or perform a factory reset. If the problem is still there, there’s a great chance that hardware is malfunctioning. </p>

<p> Hello, I spent countless hours with Honor 8 Customer Support. They are no help at all. I can not set original mail app. At the end of process I am getting message: “could not establish connection to the server due to untrusted or invalid certificate”. When I work with other mail apps I can utilize only these which are not using any credentials and are unsafe. Anyone can help, please? </p>

<p> Hi, i got Honor 8 a week ago, and it was already showing OS 7 update. i update and use the cell, but now i’m facing some issues, like call distortion, and ends during the call after hardly 1 minute, call connectivity and disconnection issue. WhatsApp notifications in spite of doing and setting all the advised settings; couldn’t get when screen is off. Sometimes it asked for dual authentication and sometime just unlock with finger print. I’m getting irritated by this, do you’ve solution for this, do let me know kindly. </p>
<p> Thanks Aleksandar, I’ve given my cell to Huawei Center they also advised to downgrade it. Thanks for your valuable assistance. </p>
<p> Phone is not reading contacts correctly after updating to nougat. Everyone reads as “unknown sender”. Same issue no matter the message app. Factory reset worked for a day, now it’s acting up again. </p>
<p> Hello, Duane! Have you tried clearing message app cache/data? Additionally, you may want to update your messaging apps. The last thing that comes to my mind is deleting and resetting Google account. Have in mind that will work only if you backed up your contacts earlier. </p>

<p> Redmi K20 Pro / Mi 9T Pro common problems and how to solve them </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro (also known as the Mi 9T Pro outside India) feels like a sure bet. It successfully bridges the gap between the flagship and budget segments by bringing the best of both worlds. The flagship-level specs at the budget price. </p>
<p> This business model has already proven to be a recipe for success in recent years. Smartphone prices are going through the roof, and customers are looking for the remedy in models like this. That’s why the Pocophone F1 was big last year, and that’s why the K20 Pro /Mi 9T Pro threatens to take its place as the people’s champion now (at least until Xiaomi throws the Poco F2 at us). And most importantly, that’s why you ended up buying this phone. </p>
<p> Many reviewers will tell you that because of the phone’s cost, you have to be content with potential downsides and issues. I would like to argue with that. If you bought the Redmi K20/Mi 9T Pro, you clearly want the most for your money. So, just because you didn’t pay $1000+, doesn’t mean you must let the problems sit there like they’re part of the deal. Instead, you should go and try your best to resolve them. </p>
<p> And that brings us to the main point of this article. I’ve gone through various forums online and concluded a list of the most common problems (and fixes) with the Redmi K20 Pro/Mi 9 T. So, in case you encountered any issue with your brand new phone, I hope you’ll find the solution here. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching it, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Wi-Fi not working </p>
<p> The problem with connecting to Wi-Fi isn’t a widespread problem. But that doesn’t really matter to you if you’re currently experiencing this issue. So, in case you’re unable to properly connect to a Wi-Fi network, try some of the following solutions: </p>
<p> Delete all networks and try reconnecting. </p>
<p> Disable Always On for Mobile Data in Developer options. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Reset App Preferences. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Open Settings > More > Reset WLAN, mobile & Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 2. Popup camera not working </p>
<p> The popup camera is surely the K20 Pro’s highlight feature. However, some users reported that it doesn’t always work as intended. You certainly don’t want your camera to fail at popping up every time, especially if you’re already skeptical about this technology. </p>
<p> When you experience this issue, there’s really nothing you can do about it, software-wise. You either wait for a potential system update that will address the problem, or replace your phone. </p>
<p> Luckily, you’re closer to the first option. Xiaomi already released an update that addresses the popup camera issue, per 91Mobiles. So, if you haven’t already, go on and update your phone. Hopefully, the problem will be resolved. </p>
<p> 3. Screen flickering </p>
<p> The Redmi 20 Pro’s AMOLED screen is another reason why many users upgraded to this phone. The display may not be the best in the business, but it still provides a satisfying experience. </p>
<p> However, a few users reported strange screen flickering when the display is set to low brightness. If you recently encountered such a problem, try some of the following solutions: </p>
<p> Update your phone. Xiaomi should eventually release a patch. </p>
<p> Adjust brightness. </p>
<p> Install the OLED Saver app as a temporary solution until Xiaomi fixes the problem. </p>
<p> 4. Microphone not working </p>
<p> Microphone issue shouldn’t be widespread, as I only found a single report in the forums. Nevertheless, people who encountered this issue suggest restarting Google Assistant as a solution. So, that’s what I’m going to recommend, as well. </p>
<p> Google services > Search, Assistant & Voice > Google Assistant > Assistant tab > Phone > Google Assistant toggle OFF </p>
<p> Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Go to Search, Assistant & Voice > Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Head over to the Assistant tab, find your phone and tap it. </p>
<p> Toggle Google Assistant off. </p>
<p> Now, restart your phone, and check if the microphone started working. To re-enable Google Assistant, repeat the procedure above, and toggle it on. </p>
<p> 5.Headphones not playing music </p>
<p> The same thing goes for headphones. If your Bluetooth headphones are not playing music, try the following solution: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Sound > Earphones > Headphones and audio effects. </p>
<p> Choose the Control volume button option. </p>
<p> 6. Random reboots </p>
<p> I’ve only seen reports of random reboots from users who are on custom ROMs. So, if you’ve recently encountered a similar problem, I’m assuming you’re also using a custom ROM. </p>
<p> Flashing custom ROMs is already a journey of its own and the issues which might occur are probably well-known to all advanced users. And since we’re not writing about custom ROMs here, try searching for a solution someplace else, where people are people are dealing with similar issues, like the XDA forums. </p>
<p> If you can’t find a solution after all, I’d suggest reflashing the stock ROM and sticking with it for some time. At least until developers of your current ROM deal with all the potential problems. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I certainly hope you found a solution to your problem, or at least you understand it better now. If you have any comments, questions, or a problem I didn’t mention in this article, feel free to write it down in the comments below. </p>

<p> Fix: Unable to connect car’s Media System and Android via Bluetooth </p>
<p> Pairing your Android phone and your car’s media system via Bluetooth is of great use, both for handsfree purposes and media streaming. But, we found reports of some awkward issues concerning playback while trying to connect Nougat 7.0 device with car media system. </p>
<p> Car and Android won’t connect via Bluetooth </p>
<p> One of the members of the XDA forum has stated that his Huawei Mate 9 can pair with his car but playback won’t start every time. He is concerned with its erratic behavior. Supposedly, phone pairs with every other device except the car. </p>
<p> Another member is having trouble with the similar problem. Devices can pair but, while music is playing, handsfree mode won’t react to incoming calls. </p>
<p> Well, there is one solution that can be of use if you have the same issue on your Android. </p>
<p> Swiftly delete the device from pairing list and retry </p>
<p> Sometimes the cure for the problem is easier than it seems. To do that follow these instructions. </p>
<p> 1. Go to Settings > Wireless and Networks > Bluetooth </p>
<p> 2. Turn your Bluetooth ON </p>
<p> 3. In the list of paired devices select your car Bluetooth device </p>
<p> 4. Select Forget </p>
<p> 5. Then search for devices and select your car Bluetooth device </p>
<p> 6. Tap Pair </p>
<p> 7. If you are prompted for four digits PIN, enter it </p>
<p> Have in mind that some cars board computers have a special button that enables Bluetooth connection. </p>
<p> If this solution is not helpful, don’t worry. There is probably a bug in Nougat 7.0 that is making all this trouble. Luckily, it is said that solution will be available in a first update . Nougat 7.11 is here today so we hope that unpleasant experience with this problem has come to an end. </p>
<p> If you are having the same problem, please inform us in the comment section. Also, if you managed to solve it, let us know. Traveling to work without your favorite playlist is a thing no one should endure for long. </p>

<p> Hi For some reason I am unable to connect my Garmin Sports watches with the Honor 8 Pro. The BT pairing code keeps refreshing every second and hence I am unable to key it in before it refreshes again. Finally I get the Connection Timed Out Error. This happens only with the 8 Pro. All other phones I have tried have no issues at all. </p>
<p> Am really frustrated now! Any help in resolving this is highly appreciated. </p>
<p> Just got a new Huawei Mate 9 from Optus Australia. It would not connect to my car bluetooth although it would connect to two bluetooth speakers I have. Optus technical support finally resolved the issue by changing the car bluetooth PIN from 1111 to 0000. Looks like a Huawei bug in that it can only connect to devices without a PIN or with a PIN of 0000. Checked my speakers and one has no PIN and the other has 0000 as the PIN. Hopefully Huawei will fix this. </p>
<p> Thank you for sharing, Greg. That’s a strange bug, to say the least. We also hope that the upcoming updates will resolve this in future firmware patches. </p>
<p> My huewwai note 2 I connects to my car but only allows hands free telephone calls. No call history and worst still no Internet call. Google maps audio or Internet calls </p>

<p> My mate 9 fails when trying to connect to my car hands free. I have spent hours doing all the recommended fixes. Nothing works. The phone connects to other phones. Other phones connect to the handsfree. So all devices are working. Just no communication between the handsfree and the Huawei. The mate 9 sees the handsfree, but can’t connect. It gives no reason. Just says can’t connect. Please assist. </p>

<p> Hi For some reason I am unable to connect my Garmin Sports watches with the Honor 8 Pro. The BT pairing code keeps refreshing every second and hence I am unable to key it in before it refreshes again. Finally I get the Connection Timed Out Error. This happens only with the 8 Pro. All other phones I have tried have no issues at all. </p>
<p> Am really frustrated now! Any help in resolving this is highly appreciated. </p>

<p> Just got a new Huawei Mate 9 from Optus Australia. It would not connect to my car bluetooth although it would connect to two bluetooth speakers I have. Optus technical support finally resolved the issue by changing the car bluetooth PIN from 1111 to 0000. Looks like a Huawei bug in that it can only connect to devices without a PIN or with a PIN of 0000. Checked my speakers and one has no PIN and the other has 0000 as the PIN. Hopefully Huawei will fix this. </p>

<p> Fix: Screen brightness unexpectedly dims on iPhone </p>
<p> It’s easy to overlook certain rad iOS features just because they’re not obvious. Nonetheless, we’re sure that without them, the premium nature of iPhone would fall below the expectations. On the other hand, if you are not informed about those features, they may appear to be a weird system issue or 3rd-party app’s error. </p>
<p> One user on Apple’s community forum experienced something strange in regard to screen brightness and we’re bringing you his/hers experience below: </p>
<p> ”I turned on the maximum brightness screen and I turned off the brightness mode but why when I turned on max brightness and I played the game for about 10 minutes then my screen light suddenly darkened To some extent but while the light bar in the control center is still the maximum. After I stop playing the game, the screen light will come back to normal after about 10 minutes! I do not understand what is happening on my device.” </p>
<p> You can find the explanation below. </p>
<p> Why may iPhone dim screen while gaming? </p>
<p> As you can see for yourself, this seems like a strange bug. But just on a first glance. This isn’t the problem but it’s rather a solution for overheating. If you have been using your device for the extended period of time, especially playing a demanding game, the phone will, logically, start to heat up. In order to prevent overheating and possible hardware damage, iOS software regulates certain processes in order to ”cool down” the device. </p>
<p> This is a standard practice, so you have nothing to worry about. Just leave your phone for some time and everything, including the screen brightness, will restore to normal values and activity. </p>
<p> These are some features that will be affected by the changes iOS inflicts in order to prevent the device from overheating: </p>
<p> Camera flash will be temporarily disabled. </p>
<p> Cellular radio will enter the low-energy state which might affect your signal and Mobile Data. </p>
<p> The display will dim or turn black temporarily. </p>
<p> If the device is plugged into the wall socket, it will stop charging. </p>
<p> If the temperatures are above the norms, you’ll see the emergency prompt that informs you about the current state. In order to use your device, you’ll need to wait for the cooldown. </p>
<p> How to speed up the cooldown process or even avoid heating? </p>
<p> You can speed up the cooldown by unplugging your device from a charger, avoiding sun exposure and just let it be. On the other hand, if you’re keen to prevent overheating, it’s paramount to use your handset only when it’s not charging. This especially comes into play when is hot outside. In addition, don’t expose it to sun or heat sources for the extended period of time. And, finally, if you run graphically demanding games, make sure to take a break from time to time. </p>
<p> We hope that this was a helpful read. What’s your experience with overheating? Please do share your thoughts in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Thanks this was helpful my screen would dim playing my game, But still dimmed frequent even though the game was closed. The phone did heat up </p>
<p> I think I phone has a design flaw from what I’ve read it was intentional but for someone like myself who has trouble seeing what is on my phone when the phone warms up screen goes dim making it for me almost impossible to see I can’t help that I work in west Texas we’re it’s always hot outside but you need to send a fix for this </p>

<p> I had a 6S Plus that did this frequently, so I traded it in for an XS Max thinking it would improve. It has, sort of, I usually have this happen when I have it plugged in charging in my truck. The quickest way I’ve found to cool my phone down is to take the case off, crank my AC as cold as I can get it, and stick my phone, on sleep, right in front of the vent until the back of the phone feels cold. It usually works within a few seconds…display back to its full glory! </p>

<p> I just got back from the apple store with a new iphone!!! – multiple calls to apple over chat, phone and in-store appointments. I managed to take a video of this happening and they HAD NO IDEA. It was also escalated to 3rd line devs over the phone and they could not figure this out. Thanks for the new phone tho 😀 </p>
<p> Sucks that it cant handle long gaming sessions >:( I also found that 3rd party wireless charges cause over heating too. </p>

<p> You are right, this is a bug ! I loved the brightness of Apple products in the sun. Now this advantage has gone. After a few minutes the iOS device dimms down and the screen becomes unusable in so many situations. Full brightness only works in the dark ! Rudiculous! </p>

<p> Fix: Poor call sound quality on iPhone 7 </p>
<p> Smartphones are taking over. Statistically, the most used multimedia devices in upcoming years are going to be the handheld ones. Browsing on the go, social media and fast-paced, online communications are main traits that modern user needs. However, what happened with its main use? With good old standard calls? </p>
<p> For example, you can do more stuff with your iPhone 7 than with desktop computer but the in-call sound is distorted. Especially while using standard calls. </p>
<p> The hefty number of iPhone 7 users reported a problem concerning the in-call disturbance. </p>
<p> Today we prepared for you some optimal solutions for distorting and hollow sound, and/or bad microphone performance while making a call. </p>
<p> How to improve bad call sound quality on iPhone 7 </p>
<p> One small disclaimer before we start. If your iPhone 7 or 7+ variation are having the hardware issue, this steps may help. However, our advice is to contact your Apple Support. </p>
<p> Disable Noise cancellation on iPhone 7 </p>
<p> Noise cancellation is a built-in option that helps you by reducing ambient noise while speaking on the phone. Good intention but some of the users found it unsatisfying. To disable it, follow the instructions: </p>
<p> Tap Settings </p>
<p> Select General </p>
<p> Choose Accessibility </p>
<p> At the bottom, you will find Phone Noise Cancellation </p>
<p> Turn it OFF </p>
<p> Select Data Only in Mobile Data Options </p>
<p> There may be a problem concerning your Mobile Data. Maybe your VoLTE ( Voice over LTE) is the one that makes calls distorted, so try disabling it. To that follow this path: </p>
<p> Select Mobile Data </p>
<p> Choose Mobile Data Options </p>
<p> Tap Enable LTE </p>
<p> Try using the phone without the case </p>
<p> There are some reports that your case can be the issue while speaking on the phone. Because it covers rear microphone, sometimes may cause the distortion. </p>
<p> Remove your case and check your in-call performance without it. </p>
<p> Turn Off the Bluetooth </p>
<p> Interference may also occur because of your headset and phone speaker. To be sure that is not the case, disable Bluetooth: </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Select Bluetooth </p>
<p> Turn Bluetooth OFF. </p>
<p> Try restarting the phone </p>
<p> If the problem is somehow connected to the software, the reset may be of help. To reset your iPhone 7, do the following: </p>
<p> Press and hold Wake and Volume Down buttons </p>
<p> Wait until the Apple logo appears. </p>
<p> Try updating to the latest version of iOS </p>
<p> Keeping your phone updated is a good way to overcame slight software issues, probably even the sound ones. To update your system, follow these instructions. </p>
<p> Make sure your iPhone 7 is connected to a Wi-Fi and charging. </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Choose General </p>
<p> Select Software Update </p>
<p> Tap Download & Install </p>
<p> These were our tips to a possible solution to your annoying problem. We hope it will help you to perform better in-call performance. If you are still heaving trouble concerning iPhone 7, please be free to share it with us in the comment section. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> I’ve had a number of iphones–the 7 is without a doubt the worst regarding sound quality and connectivity. I rarely get through a call without loss of the call or distortion so great the call is a burden. Awful, awful, awful. </p>
<p> We hear you, Jim. It seems that they chased flashy improvements while neglecting fundamental phone features. </p>
<p> But I can’t believe they can sell you a phone for £850 that doesn’t make calls properly and your stuck with it!!!! In this case you should be given a full refund as it’s unfit for use </p>
<p> I have the same issues for 5 weeks. I even got a new iPhone 7 and then today a new sim card put in. It improved for one call and I am back to needing to use the speaker feature to speak with anyone. I asked for any other phone today that I could talk to people on. Verizon said any other iPhone would have the software problem too. Left me hanging… </p>

<p> I am having the same problem with my iPhone 7. With the Lifeproof case on it (which I bought because I am around water a lot), people say I sound muffled. I have to consciously speak at a much lower volume, so that to people on my end of the conversation get to experience me yelling into my phone. I have finally taken the case off. Apparently the problem is that the iPhone 7 has only 2 or 3 microphones and something like the Android, which doesn’t have this problem, has 7 microphones.

<p> I’m on my 2nd replacement – so 3rd iPhone 7 in 6 months & every one of them has terrible sound issues. Callers constantly say my voice breaks up, or is garbled, or muffled, or like I’m talking through water. This is my business phone and I deal with a lot of clients so it is a real issue and no one seems to have an answer. Apple has to be aware of the problem but doesn’t seem to have a fix. Very frustrating. </p>

<p> Believe it or not. My husband bought an iPhone 7 plus two months ago it was a disaster as every one said they can’t understand because the sound is hollow and distorted. He went back to the dealer and got it exchanged but for his bad luck the second was the same. Yesterday he went back to get the third one and it was the worst. I could barely understand him when he called me from work. He is so disappointed and upset. Every single phone should be tested for defects before releasing such garbage into the market. </p>

<p> I second that the phone cases might have been the issue that affects the call quality. It happened to be my experience that every time I was on the call, the other end would tell me that they couldn’t hear me, or my sound was muffed, while I could hear them just fine. I have been using wallet cases for over a year…and ever since I remove my phone from the case, everyone, I repeat, EVERYONE, on the phone told me they could hear me very clearly. My wallet case only slightly covers half of the two microphones my iPhone… Read more » </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy A70 common problems and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung has firmly re-entered the midrange segment this year. Users already love the company’s budget champion, the Galaxy A50, and its bigger brother, the A70, only improves on an already strong base. </p>
<p> Sure, the A70 might not be the best value for money in the whole A series, but it offers something authentic. It brings a good portion of the Galaxy Note experience with its huge AMOLED display. Only for the chunk of the price. If you value big phones, but don’t want to spend a small fortune, the Galaxy A70 is a way to go. You probably think the same way, and that’s why you just bought this device. </p>
<p> But then, the first problems start to appear. And there aren’t too many things as annoying as problems on a phone fresh out of the box. That’s why I compiled a list of the most common problems with the Galaxy A70 for you. Just find the issue that’s bothering you, and you’ll either find a solution, or understand the problem better. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Touch screen issues </p>
<p> When the phone’s highlight feature is its display, the last thing you’d want or expect is some screen-related problem. Unfortunately, that appears to be exactly the biggest problem with the A70. Forums are flooded with reports complaining about touch screen issues, of whom the biggest problem appears to be the multi-touch. </p>
<p> Apparently, users are having multi-touch issues in games that use the movement stick, like PUBG. Namely, when you drag the stick to keep moving, it stops registering your finger, so you have to lift it and press the stick again. </p>
<p> I couldn’t find a solution to this problem anywhere. That means Samsung will probably address it in an update. However, there are reports about users already receiving an update that claims to fix the multi-touch issue, but it still persists. </p>
<p> I can only advise you to keep checking for new updates, and hope for the best. Hopefully, Samsung will deal with this problem once and for all in the future. </p>
<p> 2. Wi-Fi problems </p>
<p> One user has reported on Samsung forums that he’s unable to connect to his home Wi-Fi network. Other than that, Wi-Fi doesn’t appear to be the problem on the A70. Nevertheless, if you can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network, make sure everything’s okay with your router first. </p>
<p> If you can’t connect to any Wi-Fi network, try some of the solutions listed in this article. </p>
<p> 3. Overheating issue </p>
<p> Just like the reported Wi-Fi problem, overheating doesn’t appear to be a widespread problem with the Galaxy A70. However, it’s been reported, so I feel like I should include it, anyway. </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing overheating on your brand new Galaxy A70, try some of the following workarounds: </p>
<p> Disable background services, like Bluetooth, NFC, location, etc. </p>
<p> Lower the screen brightness. </p>
<p> Disable the always-on display. </p>
<p> Try a different case. </p>
<p> Install the latest updates. </p>
<p> 4. Fingerprint scanner not working </p>
<p> Another new feature the A series brings to the table is the in-display fingerprint scanner. And once again, the real-life results are great, to say the least. There are numerous reports on the forums about the A70’s fingerprint scanner either being slow or not working at all. </p>
<p> Sure, this is still a first-generation technology, and you shouldn’t expect it to work flawlessly 100% of the time. Plus, the fact that Samsung doesn’t use premium hardware in the A70 doesn’t help. But still, you want it to function to a degree where it’s at least usable. </p>
<p> Some users have reported that the fingerprint scanner started working normally after a few updates. On the other hand, some say the issue persists even on up-to-date devices. So, the only thing left for you, if you’re experiencing the fingerprint scanner issues, is to keep checking for updates and hope for the best. If the problem persists, consider replacing your phone at the store. </p>
<p> 5. Lags while gaming </p>
<p> A few reports suggest that users are expiriencing lags while gaming. Esentially, this is true, but it’s probably not a problem per se. This alleged lagging issue is actually CPU throtthling caused by a high temperature. In case you’re not familiar with the term, when your phone reaches a certain temperature, it automatically “throttles” the speed of both GPU and CPU to prevent overheating. That process is called “throttling”. </p>
<p> So, if you’ve been gaming for an extensive period of time, your phone will reach a certain temperature, and it will throttle the power of your hardware. Which means you’ll have less resources to work with, and your performance will suffer. Especially in more demanding games. </p>
<p> In that manner, if your game starts stuttering, just put your phone down for an hour, and let it cool off. You shouldn’t experience any more lagging problems afterwards. Additionally, this can also happen if your phone already overheats, like mentioned above. In that case, try some of the recommended solutions to prevent overheating. </p>
<p> That’s about it. As you can see, there aren’t too many things to worry about with the A70, which makes this phone a pretty sure bet. Sure, possible touch screen problems could get annoying but you’ll get used to it eventually. And who knows, maybe Samsung will resolve everything with a future update. </p>

<p> I can’t listen to any video on my A70 and keep having the same massege ( can’t play during calls ) but I’m not on calls. It works out when I restart my phone but have to do that every 10 minutes which is really annoying. </p>

<p> My a70 is giving me a headache for a week now.. even if its lock the screen is still on.. consuming my battery life..i check everything but still,nothing changed. </p>
<p> My Samsung Galaxy A70 is not notifying me when I get text messages. No pop up on lock screen. No sound indication and no number indicator next to icon. Yet all my settings are set to on. </p>
<p> Did you restart your phone.? If that don’t work go into play store and check for updates. </p>
<p> Ok so had the fingerprint update few days ago and guess what it still doesnt recognise it. Useless, even though multi scanned it. Face recognition works but none of 5 work. Crap </p>
<p> Maybe you don’t have a good finger print on your finger. I have a friend works on construction and has no finger print </p>
<p> I upgraded to this phone no where near as good to my last Samsung. Cuts out continuously , on the roads where previous didn’t, moving slightly in the house. Multiple issues. Less clarity. Connections difficult. On going problems. </p>

<p> I swapped my S8+ for the A70 thinking it would be at least on par with a 2 generation older device but the a70 is no where near as good. On a golf game where you have to time your shot I had a 1mm lag on the s8+ but around 5mm on the a70 so unplayable. </p>
<p> The problem I am having is when I am on video chat my mic don’t work and no one can hear me till I plug in my ear buds. Can anyone help? </p>
<p> I have problem with my handset i can listen from handfree but my handfree mic doesn’t working..can anyone tell me </p>

<p> Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 common problems and how to fix them </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 is an exceptional budget device. It packs a solid set of specs and build quality, which makes it quite appealing to buyers in its price range. </p>
<p> A friend of mine recently got this device, and he’s very content with it. It easily gets him through the day with the 4000 mAh battery, and it’s also a smooth ride, thanks to 6GB of RAM and the Snapdragon 660. </p>
<p> However, just like any other phone (including much pricier models), the Redmi Note 7 has its own minor issues. Most of them happen in individual cases, but they’re still issues. So, if you recently encountered a problem with your brand new Redmi Note 7, I hope you’ll find a solution in this article. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching it, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1: Touch too sensitive </p>
<p> The first thing you’ll probably notice when using the Note 7 for the first time is that its display is probably more sensitive than what you’re used to. This is not a bug per se, it’s just how the display was made. </p>
<p> So, there’s really nothing you can do about it, because there’s no way to adjust the sensitivity with software. You can actually try a different screen protector, but I’m not sure how much it will help. </p>
<p> 2: GPS problem </p>
<p> Reportedly, GPS malfunction is a widespread problem on the Note 7. Apps like Google Maps or Waze fail to establish a connection with the GPS service, which basically renders them unusable. </p>
<p> Luckily, you’re not powerless when it comes to solving this problem. The first solution I have in mind is simply keeping your MIUI version up to date. Xiaomi will eventually release a fix (if it already hasn’t), and the problems should vanish. </p>
<p> But if the problem persists, even with the latest MIUI version installed on your phone, there’s an additional step I found on the MIUI forum you could try. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Dual Apps. </p>
<p> Turn on Google services. </p>
<p> Toggle on the apps you have problems with (Uber, Waze, etc.) </p>
<p> Tap the Battery icon. </p>
<p> Tap Go to Settings under App Battery Saver. </p>
<p> Click Google Maps/Waze/etc. </p>
<p> The ‘dual version’ of the select app will appear on your Home Screen. Use this version until Xiaomi fixes the GPS problem with an update. </p>
<p> Keep in mind this method only works with third-party apps like Uber or Waze. Meaning you can’t use Dual Apps to make GPS working in Google apps like Google Maps. For these apps, you’ll have to wait for Xiaomi to release an update. </p>
<p> 3: Battery drains </p>
<p> On paper, the Redmi Note 7 boasts a great battery capacity, that’s at the very top of its class. But when it comes to real life usage, the battery life is, well, also great. For some users. The others, less fortunate ones, have to deal with a strange drain that drastically shortens the battery life. </p>
<p> As it’s usually the case with battery drains on a new phone, the cause is unknown. It could be a software problem caused by a recent update, or the issue might be on your end. </p>
<p> According to the forums, it’s probably not your fault, as your current MIUI version drains more battery than it should. You guessed it, the solution is to wait for an update that will (hopefully) improve the battery life. </p>
<p> While you’re waiting for that rescuing update, here are a few things you can try to improve the battery life: </p>
<p> Uninstall battery consuming apps. Check the battery usage per app by going to Settings > Battery & performance > Power usage. </p>
<p> Turn off system animations: Settings > Additional settings > Accessibility > Remove animations. </p>
<p> Restrict background app processes: Settings > Additional settings > Developer options > Background process limit > reduce the number of background processes. </p>
<p> Disable automatic brightness: Settings > Display > Brightness level > disable automatic brightness and adjust it manually. </p>
<p> 4: Background apps closing </p>
<p> As much as the previous solutions are helpful for extending the battery life on your Note 7, they also require compromises. Because you simply cannot have one thing without sacrificing another. Xiaomi knows this, so the company actually made some efforts to automatize that “sacrificing process” and make power management easier for users. That’s how a feature called MIUI optimization was introduced. </p>
<p> This feature automatically restricts certain processes on your phone, in order to extend the battery life while eliminating the need for any tweaks on users’ end. Sure, MIUI Optimization improves power management, but compromises are sometimes too big for users to bear with. </p>
<p> In the Note 7’s case, the MIUI optimization feature seems to automatically close the apps running in the background. Usually, that shouldn’t bother you, but if the apps you regularly use are being constantly closed, you’d probably want this to stop happening. </p>
<p> The obvious solution for this is to disable the MIUI Optimization feature. Yes, disabling it will slightly shrink the battery life, but you probably won’t even notice the difference. What makes the case for disabling this feature even stronger are reports of MIUI Optimization interfering with some non-MIUI based apps, eventually causing even more problems, as mentioned in this forum post. </p>
<p> To disable MIUI Optimization, you need to have Developer options enabled first. To enable Developer options, go to Settings > About Phone > tap the MIUI version 7 times, until the message saying “You’re now a developer!” appears. </p>
<p> Now that we have access to Developer options, here’s how to disable MIUI Optimization: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Additional settings > Developer options. </p>
<p> Find MIUI Optimization, and disable it. </p>
<p> 5: Face unlock not working </p>
<p> This one is as old as the face unlocking technology in Xiaomi phones. And the answer to the question “why can’t I use the Face unlock feature on my brand new Xiaomi phone” is always the same. It’s not available in your region! </p>
<p> Face unlock is restricted in most areas of the world. Some regions will get this feature with future system updates, some won’t. So, if you’re in an unsupported region, but still want to be able to unlock your phone with your face, the only solution is to switch to a supported region. </p>
<p> Your best bet, in this case, is Hong Kong, since the Face Unlock on the Redmi Note 7 is confirmed to work in this region. To change your phone’s region, go to Settings > Additional Settings > Region, and set it to Hong Kong. </p>
<p> 6: Notifications not showing </p>
<p> And finally, a problem that’s common to many Xiaomi phones. You probably find it very annoying that notifications only briefly show in the bar next to the clock, and the immediately disappear. </p>
<p> This wouldn’t even make it to the list of problems if the Note 7 had a huge notch. There simply wouldn’t be enough space for additional icons. But since the Note 7 features a teardrop notch, there’s plenty of space left for notifications. </p>
<p> Apparently, the current version of MIUI (10.3.6 at the time of writing) isn’t well optimized for different notch sizes. So, the pattern stays the same, regardless of whether your phone has a gigantic notch, or just a teardrop. </p>
<p> There are rumors MIUI 11 will fix this inconvenience. So, the only thing left for you is to bear with disappearing icons, and hope the next system version (expected in a month or two) will deal with this. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I certainly hope this article helped you resolve (or at least better understand) your problems with the Note 7. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, just write them down in the comments below. </p>

<p> Dude, I’m freaked out! I just bought a redmi note 7 pro 6gb/128gb, I’ve done this procedure, and nothing solved! The phone only signals in open areas when it does! Networking very bad, I’ve tried sim cards from all carriers and nothing !! Very frustrating, because I longed to buy this phone! Already tried everything, nothing solved the problem, unfortunately! I’ve read in many forums that a lot of people have this problem, and xiaomi so far has no pronunciation about the problem! Unfortunate that! </p>
<p> I’m experiencing some minor issues that I’m afraid the could lead to bigger problems in the Future with this device. </p>
<p> Every time I turn On the Wifi of the phone, a sudden lags starts to interfere its performance. Even when I download and screen lock my device, it automatically Shutdown or Rebooting by itself. </p>
<p> Hope that there’s an answer to my case, and I yhink I am not the only one who experiencing this. </p>

<p> Not showing notifications for more than few seconds kills this phone. Are they assuming we constantly stare at our screens or can have the sound on? In my job I cannot have my phone making any sound, and I can only check it every couple of hours. I am therefore dependent upon visual notifications staying in the notification bar. I have just download a missed calls app to overcome this so I hope it works (having tried a number) but I have my doubts as blogs around this show little luck with any app to resolve it.

<p> Fix: Instagram Videos Not Playing On Android </p>
<p> Instagram has become an integral part of the ever-growing social networks family. Besides standard photos, you’re also able to share short GIF-like videos. If the picture is worth 1000 words, the video must be worth a bit more, does it? </p>
<p> While Instagram rarely has stability issues, the video playback can get stuck from time to time. Additionally, that can lead to app crash or instability or nervous breakdowns. So, if you are experiencing video issues, you’ve come to the right spot. Let’s try and resolve this issue together and get those videos up and running. </p>
<p> Update Instagram app </p>
<p> The first step you should take is updating your Instagram app. Most of the time, the problem lies in outdated version. Because of that, make sure you have the latest version at any given time. The auto-update should do the job for you, but you can look up for updates manually, too. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Tap Menu. </p>
<p> Look up for Instagram in Update tab. </p>
<p> Choose to update. </p>
<p> Once it’s done, open Instagram and try playing videos. </p>
<p> In case the videos still won’t play, let’s try additional steps. </p>
<p> Clear Instagram app cache and data </p>
<p> As same as the most of the apps do, Instagram stores a lot of data on your phone. With particular settings, every picture or video you post can be preserved on the phone storage or SD card. Moreover, there’s a lot of cache files that may slow down the app gradually and impact video playback. </p>
<p> According to that, your next step should be clearing cache and data from the Instagram app. Follow these instructions to clear Data and Cache. </p>
<p> Clear Cache and Data. </p>
<p> Some users use specific apps for automatic clearing of cache. However, we advise you not to use them. Firstly, they take your storage space, and secondly, they tend to work in the background and slow down all-around performance. Simply put, that kind of apps are more disadvantage than a valid tool. </p>
<p> Reinstall Instagram </p>
<p> Sometimes the apps may stuck because of some kind of the corruption. Software sometimes has a mind of its own and the only viable solution is reinstallation. So, if you’ve tried previous steps and the videos still won’t load, try this out. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Most of the time, this should resolve your issue. Of course, if the software is an issue. However, sometimes the connection may play the main part in this Instagram wrongdoings. Move on to the next step to troubleshoot the connection. </p>
<p> Restart Wi-Fi router </p>
<p> Some users reported on various forums that the Instagram videos work on Wi-Fi but won’t work on mobile data and vice versa. So, the first step is to restart your Wi-Fi router. Turn it off, wait a minute or so, and then turn it on. </p>
<p> Additionally, you may want to update router firmware and change from 5 GHz band to 2.4 GHz. Even though the 5 GHz supports higher speeds, it’s signal isn’t as reliable as 2.4 GHz over distance. That, of course, is not an issue with dual-band routers. </p>
<p> Reset your Network settings </p>
<p> Once you’ve tweaked your router, let’s reset network settings on the phone. That should fix common connection bugs and let you start from the scratch. Have in mind that you’ll need to reestablish the settings again. </p>
<p> Choose Network Settings Reset. </p>
<p> Tap RESET SETTINGS. </p>
<p> Turn off Power-saving mode </p>
<p> Thanks to one of our readers, we obtained another workaround that just may be the one that resolves the problem. He resolved the problem by disabling the Power-saving mode, that somehow interferes with the Instagram videos playback. So, navigate to Power settings, disable Power-saving mode and your problem should be sorted out. </p>
<p> Thanks a lot to Matt that suggested this solution. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. In case you have any additional problems with Instagram, please be free to tell us in the comments, or reach us out on Twitter. We’ll do our best to help you resolve them. </p>

Can not uninstall since Android has preinstalled it and don’t want to disable app. Tried to use instagram help center but when I type in search bar it says I am “misusing feature” by going to fast and I’ve been blocked.

<p> I have a HTC One M9 and have been having the same problem since I updated my phones software a few days ago. Also, I can only uninstall the Instagram updates not the entire app since I did the phone update. </p>
<p> Have you tried the factory reset? I’m aware that this approach seems extreme but it looks like the Instagram comes preinstalled in your case. So you won’t be able to reinstall it. At least, not without flashing your stock ROM: </p>
<p> Mine is the HTC M10. The app can be uninstalled, but none of these solutions work. And there’s no way to clear app cache without clearing the whole app of its data, which I’ve done a few times, with no success. </p>

<p> I’ve been having problems with videos not working since the last android update and I’ve tried all of these things. Both videos in my feed and my story videos. This is really disturbing because it doesn’t seem like anyone else has the same problem as I. </p>
<p> Have you tried installing a Flash player of some kind? It’s not needed, but it’s worth a try. Additionally, try switching from mobile data to Wi-Fi and vice versa when playing videos. </p>
<p> As above, S7 not loading any videos or stories since last update. Have tried everything suggested, switching between wifi and mobile data, clearing and resetting everything and still no results </p>
<p> I have a Samsung S7 edge and have the same issue. My videos won’t play in my Gallery. And now they have stopped playing in my feed too! Has anyone found a solution yet?? </p>
<p> Don’t put your device in the power saving mode or allow the app to use data in the parameter. </p>
<p> If you have a new galaxy phone just go to app settings, instagram, and allow all permissions. Restart phone and your welcome </p>
<p> All videos on my Instagram don’t work for me either. I’ve tried everything on this kid, plus a few other things. None of it works… It’s very annoying when someone sends something and it can’t even be viewed. </p>
<p> Same issue. Just updated in the last 2 days and no videos will play on instagram. Annoying to say the least!! </p>
<p> I do. i dont know what to do, i have tried all type of troubleshooting, when i do it it work for a couple of videos and then stops playing again. The funny thing is that the videos on the stories and the sponsors they play. </p>

<p> How to fix Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 microphone issues </p>
<p> Xiaomi is taking over. The Chinese manufacturer has been producing some great mid-budget handheld devices and receives critical acclaim from both professionals and customers. Additionally, MIUI, the Android-based OS, works as good as you would expect. </p>
<p> However, same as Android, it has its known issues. One of the most reported issues is related to the microphone. Or better, mics. That goes for multiple Xiaomi models, but today we’ll try to address the most popular one. </p>
<p> Of course, we are talking about the Redmi Note 3. This specific device packs two microphones. In theory, they should improve sound but it seems that is not the case always. Somehow they occasionally provoke low sound quality, both in-call and while recording. Nonetheless, there are a few solutions available for this issue. We collected most useful ones, with the hope to help you overcome this problem. </p>
<p> Disable Google Now </p>
<p> Xiaomi’s MIUI stands shoulder to shoulder with the Android operating system. For global market, they offer a quite clean system without excessive bloatware. Also, they implemented a lot of Android features. However, implementing and optimizing those features are two things apart. Google Assistant (Google Now) is a known culprit for the mic issues and you should disable it. </p>
<p> Tap Search & Now. </p>
<p> Choose Voice. </p>
<p> Tap OK Google detection. </p>
<p> Have in mind that this is just a temporary solution and that it should be permanently resolved with future updates. Then you can use your smart assistant in a seamless fashion. </p>
<p> Update your Firmware </p>
<p> Behind MIUI we have a group of knowledgeable enthusiasts and technicians that work hard for top results. Some of the better-known companies have to look up to this guys. However, for better or worse, updates are not functioning the same way as on Android. You’ll need to download ROM and upgrade with it, rather than download and install updates directly from update servers. Moreover, this way you’ll need to backup your data since everything from the internal memory will be wiped out. </p>
<p> Select the ROM you’ve transferred from PC. </p>
<p> The upgrade should start and you’ll be prompted to confirm. </p>
<p> After the process is finished, start your device and test the microphone. </p>
<p> Use SoundAbout app to configure the mic </p>
<p> One of the temporary solutions is Sound About app from the Play Store. With this app, you can configure speakers and microphones. Additionally, and that is related to this problem, you can disable secondary microphone and therefore temporary improve the in-call sound quality. </p>
<p> Those were our solutions. As we already stated, they are just temporary workarounds until the developers fix the code. In case you have any questions or remarks, do tell us in the comments section. Or reach us out on Twitter. We look forward to helping you. </p>

<p> These suggestions didn’t help. I have to make all my phone calls with the speaker on or the caller doesn’t hear anything. This started after installing the last update. </p>
<p> In my case it is a hardware issue, the microphone connection is bad. There are some videos on YouTube on how to fix this easily. To see if this is the issue, you simply need to record your voice while firmly squeezing the phone where the microphone is located. It will suddenly start working (until you let go). </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy J3 most common issues and how to resolve them </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy J3 is more than a viable option in the lower low-budget category. If you’re not exceptionally demanding user and a loyal fan of Samsung handsets, J3 is well-suited for the job. However, for this and the majority of handsets, there are always issues that need to be addressed. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we prepared a list of most frequently reported problems provided by J3 users. Of course, we provided you with the proper troubleshooting steps, so make sure to check for your individual problem. We hope that you’ll find the remedy for your ache in the list below. </p>
<p> Battery issues </p>
<p> First, the main reason why people seem to deem the overall usability of this handset lackluster is the battery. The battery on J3 isn’t bad per se, and it certainly won the battle with the competition in 2016. Nonetheless, it’s the software within the device that drains the battery. So, even though the 2600 mAh battery is well-performing, there are still ways to improve the battery life and reduce the consumption. For that purpose, we enlisted some of those workarounds below: </p>
<p> Disable background apps. You can either do it manually within Settings > Application manager or by using the Smart Manager (Device Maintainance). Navigate to Settings > Device Maintainance > Unmonitored apps, and clear apps that are using the battery extensively while working in the background. </p>
<p> Use Battery Power Saving mode. Tap Settings > Device Maintainance > Battery and use one of two battery saving modes. </p>
<p> Disable GPS. You can either disable GPS permanently until an app acquires it or reduce the accuracy of the location service by changing location method to Phone only. Tap Settings > Connections > Enable Location > Location method, and switch to Phone only. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> In addition, make sure to uninstall the redundant and unused apps that are hogging on your device resources. We hope that with those, you’ll be able to extend your battery’s life. </p>
<p> Overheating issues </p>
<p> Overheating isn’t exactly a common problem, but it does affect certain users. And once it occurs, it’s likely to make your overall experience with the J3 quite hard to cope with. Moreover, if the phone is overheating over extended periods, you may encounter more than lags and stutters. Namely, in the worst case scenario, you can expect hardware failure. Obviously, it’s essential to address the overheating issue before it’s too late. </p>
<p> There are various reasons for this occurrence, and we advise you to check the following steps in order to prevent them: </p>
<p> Don’t use your phone while charging. </p>
<p> Check the resource hogging apps in the background. </p>
<p> Make sure that your battery isn’t faulty. </p>
<p> Remove the casing. </p>
<p> Don’t expose your handset to heat sources over an extended period of times. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Connectivity issues are generally not unusual for a multitude of Android handsets. Some of them suffer from the lackluster signal, while others are known for connection crashes. Either way, it’s hard to use your device as intended without the proper Wi-Fi connection. Almost impossible. Samsung Galaxy J3 isn’t exactly known for Wi-Fi issues, but some isolated cases are still enough for us to address the issue. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to follow the instructions below in order to troubleshoot Wi-Fi issues on your J3: </p>
<p> Forget Network and connect again. </p>
<p> Press and hold on Wi-Fi icon in the Notification panel to open Wi-Fi settings. </p>
<p> Use 5 GHz instead of 2.4 GHz and vice versa. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Turn off the device. Make sure that your battery is not critically low. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Up key + Home key + Power button. </p>
<p> Once the logo appears on the screen, release the Power button while holding the Volume Up key + Home key. </p>
<p> Wait for the Android logo to appear and release all buttons. </p>
<p> Use the Volume Down key to find and highlight the ‘wipe cache partition’ option. </p>
<p> Use the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Now, scroll down with the Volume Down key and highlight ”Yes”. </p>
<p> Mobile data issues </p>
<p> As same as with the Wi-Fi, some users experienced issues with the Mobile Data. Some of them weren’t able to use the 3G/4G as intended due to SIM card issues, while others encountered issues with unexpected signal drops and similar irregularities. Most of the time, the issue is closely related to an inappropriate position of the SIM card. Cellular signal drops are the best way to find out is your SIM card properly inserted in the SIM tray. </p>
<p> On the other hand, there are also some software issues that need to be examined, since the problem isn’t exclusively connected to the SIM card. Follow the instructions below to troubleshoot the mobile data issues on your Samsung Galaxy J3: </p>
<p> Reset your device. </p>
<p> Switch Network type. Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> TurnAirplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. Go to Settings > Connections> Mobile Networks > Tap Access Point Names > More > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> With that, you should be able to use the mobile data just like before. </p>
<p> SD card issues </p>
<p> SD card is of utmost importance if you want to store more multimedia since the device is limited to 16 GB of internal storage. However, users reported issues with SD cards, too. Namely, some of them weren’t able to transfer the data from internal storage to SD. Other – well – their J3 wouldn’t even recognize the SD card or suddenly unmounts it. For that purpose, we advise you to follow the steps below, since there are multiple ways to address this issue. </p>
<p> Power Off your device and remove SD card from the slot. Clean the slot with the compressed air and re-insert the SD card. </p>
<p> Backup your SD card on your PC and format it. Make sure to format or reformat the SD card and copy the backed-up content again. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Unexpected shutdown issues </p>
<p> If we take into consideration all enlisted issues of J3, this is probably the most intimidating one. Some users pointed out the major issue with regard to sudden restarts or even shutdowns. There are few reasons for this occurrence and we’re presenting them below: </p>
<p> The phone is overheating. </p>
<p> Custom ROM causes issues with the hardware. </p>
<p> Hardware failure. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to look at presented solutions for overheating issue and flash your device again. In addition, you can try to boot into the safe mode and examine the behavior. If the phone is working as intended, make sure to delete all lately installed apps. In contrary, if the device is still failing, it’s likely that we’re looking at hardware malfunction. So make sure to take your Samsung Galaxy J3 for repairs. </p>
<p> SIM card issues </p>
<p> You would imagine that this is a problem similar to the one with the SD card. Symptoms are obviously different, but the reason is, most of the time, inappropriate placement. On the other hand, with the latest updates, users with SIM card issues (sudden loss of network signal, mobile data loss, and ”Please insert SIM card” error) are rightfully suspecting the software involvement, as well. For that purpose, we prepared a list of possible solutions you should take into consideration: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Reinsert SIM card and/or switch SIM 1 and SIM 2 positions if you’re using dual-SIM option. </p>
<p> Try your SIM card in another handset to make sure it’s working. </p>
<p> Select ”3G only”. Navigate to Settings > Connections > Mobile Networks > Network Mode, and choose ”3G only” from the dropdown list. </p>
<p> Select proper access point. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth temporarily. </p>
<p> Boot in the safe mode and look for changes in the signal behavior. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> In the plethora of reported issues, it wouldn’t be fair to skip on Bluetooth issues. Bluetooth-related issues that are reported, mostly refer to failed pairing or unstable connection with the paired device. This mostly occurs in a pairing J3 with the car board. Or lack of it, to be exact. Luckily, if we exclude the hardware failure of the Bluetooth radio, there are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this problem. </p>
<p> Disable other network services while using Bluetooth (Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G). </p>
<p> ”Forget” device and try to pair again. </p>
<p> Wipe partition cache (process explained above). </p>
<p> That should do it. If you have alternative issues or solutions for the problems we presented above, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. We’ll be glad to help you. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>
<p> The cable that came with the J3 isn’t recognized by my Pioneer car stereo. Low volume comes out of the phone and the display doesn’t recognize it either. I’ve had the phone less than a week! Thanks for any help. </p>
<p> Try to perform hard reset of your smartphone Press home, screen lock and volume down keys at the same time and wait few seconds. Phone will go back to factory settings. </p>

<p> I bought J3 3 weeks ago and I like this phone. I don’t expect something amazing for the money I’ve paid. Smartphone has comparable parameters to 2015 Galaxy A5. But there’s a few things that I do not like in this smartphone : there’s no light sensor so you need to adjust the display backlight manually all the time – it’s irritating. The second issue is problem with maintaining Bluetooth connection. Your solution doesn’t make any sense for me because I need to use LTE and mobile router function at the same time that I use Bluetooth. Apart from that… Read more » </p>

<p> The hints here are not useful, some of them are wrong. e.g. Switching between 2.4GHz-WLAN and 5GHz-WLAN is impossible, because the J3 has no 5GHz-WLAN. also switching off IPv6 is useless, it makes the situation often worse than before </p>

<p> Fix: Google Calendar not syncing on Android </p>
<p> Multiplatform reminders are one of the most used options for the users of Android. Especially, if your work demands to organize your time and to keep track of different valuable errands. Both enterprises or personal users can find a lot of use for them. </p>
<p> Google Calendar is one of the most popular solutions for the majority of users, because of its great usability and performance. However, it doesn’t seem to be the case every time. One of the repeating issues is syncing of Google Calendar on Android devices. </p>
<p> ‘‘Until two weeks ago, I had no problem with using my Google calendar on my Samsung Galaxy S6. However, my boss uses a shared calendar to update our schedules, and for two weeks now I am only able to access the updated version on my laptop. My phone continues to show only the oldest calendar. I have tried all of the “help” section suggestions for syncing problems, including clearing my calendar data. Nothing seems to be working. Help, please!” </p>
<p> Sometimes Google Calendar won’t sync at all, sometimes it stops syncing without any special reason. We found some solutions that might be helpful. </p>
<p> Update Google Calendar app </p>
<p> Besides checking your Wi-Fi connection, the main step is updating Google Calendar app. To do so follow this instruction: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Applications or Application manager. </p>
<p> Find Google Calendar app and open it. </p>
<p> Select Update if available. </p>
<p> Unsync Google Calendar app temporarily </p>
<p> Maybe the problem lies in the misfunctioning of the all-around synchronization. This way you can reset it and, possibly make it work again. To do so, follow presented instructions: </p>
<p> Tap Google. </p>
<p> Choose your account. </p>
<p> Follow the same path and check previously unchecked Calendar tab. </p>
<p> Remove and re-establish your Gmail account </p>
<p> You can also try to reset your Gmail account because sometimes the problem occurs with Gmail synchronization. To do that, follow the instruction below: </p>
<p> Tap Accounts. </p>
<p> Select Google. </p>
<p> Choose your account. </p>
<p> Follow the same path and sign again with your Gmail account. </p>
<p> Enable Calendar Storage </p>
<p> If this option is disabled, Google Calendar won’t sync or show any events. So, be sure it is enabled. To enable Calendar Storage, follow the instructions: </p>
<p> In the top right corner tap More </p>
<p> Open Show System </p>
<p> Clear Google Calendar data </p>
<p> Clearing Google Calendar data may help you with re-establishing synchronization. However, have in mind that this may erase some unsynced data. To Clear Google Calendar data, follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps or Application manager. </p>
<p> In list of the apps installed, select Google Calendar </p>
<p> Tap Clear Data and confirm. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Stop any other app that uses connection </p>
<p> Many users found the social apps as one of the sources of the problem. These apps use a lot of system resources while maintaining background connection as well. This can create a problem for both syncing or auto-updating apps. To stop the apps from working in the background, do as follows: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps or Application manager. </p>
<p> Select preferred app. </p>
<p> Choose Force Stop. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings </p>
<p> Last resort in any problem related to Android is factory settings reset. Some of the issues tend to stack up over time. To do the factory reset, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup and Reset. </p>
<p> Backup your settings and data to Google servers via Google account. </p>
<p> Select Factory Data Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Device. </p>
<p> Choose Erase Everything. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this fix-list satisfying and helpful. Do you have any other solutions for the Google Calendar syncing problem? Please tell us in the comments. </p>
<p> Thank you for putting this out there. One note to removing/adding account again. When I added it back, calendar was not in the list of syncing options. Frustrated I kept looking on my phone. When I opened the google calendar app again it asked me for permissions to sync there. I said allow and refreshed. It took a while because I have a TON of crap with multiple accounts shared with that one account for my family, but it worked! I switched to my non-google app and refreshed and it linked right away.

<p> For my S7, the Power Saving feature was preventing calendar sync. As soon as I plugged in or disabled Power Saving, the calendar updated fine. </p>

<p> Thanks! My problem was that I could only sync manually. What appeared to solve my problem was to enable calendar storage, Following your steps above, I selected “calendar storage” and storage was already enable. When I just went to the calendar app, I found that storage was not enable. By turning that on, sync is happening automatically now. </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> Same things here. Phone is laggy, keyboard disappearing every time when using it. While playing movies, they just freeze for seconds. Changing to skia from opengl didn’t solve my problems. Just annoying. :'( </p>

<p> Switch the GPU Renderer from ‘OpenGL’ to skia (the old one). There is apparently some issue with the OpenGL renderer on Oreo on 5x. Using the old one would make your device quick and sharp again. </p>
<p> Hey great shout. I just did this and it has improved the performance substantially. Still not perfect but much more usable now. Thank you very much! </p>
<p> Thank you, this worked an absolute treat! Had to Google how to enable the developer options first though 🙂 </p>
<p> Thank you SO MUCH! This was driving me utterly bananas! </p>

<p> Same here. Very slow… Was working fine before updating. </p>
<p> Its unbelievably slow. Glad I’m not the only one I was going crazy. Funny thing is, right after a fresh install it was fine, but now it’s almost unusable … As I’m typing my words are showing up 3-4 seconds after ive keyed them in…. </p>
<p> Any body figure anything out with the disappearing keyboard issue? I assume its supposed to be some kind of feature, but I’m not liking it. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-android-nougat-bugs/comment-page-1" parent_folder="web1" id="file17847393" filename="comment-page-1">
<p> Samsung Galaxy S6 Nougat issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> For a lot of Android users around the globe lies the dilemma: older flagship or brand new mid-budget. If you ask us, we are cheering on the side of the older flagship devices. </p>
<p> For example, Samsung Galaxy S6. Amazing device, great design, sleek but occasionally erratic TouchWiz, stunning camera. What more you would expect from an Android smartphone? Well, lack of the timely and functioning software updates may come in question, but only because that’s a general problem with Samsung and not an individual handset issue. </p>
<p> So, recently, users of S6 received the Nougat via OTA update. And then the hell broke loose. Many of them reported a lot of issues and today we provided a list of most common issues and possible workarounds for each individual reported the problem. If you have a hard time with your S6 after an update, make sure to check the list below. </p>
<p> Call issues </p>
<p> We had to start with the essential feature that some users reported as broken. Well, imagine that you own an amazing feature-rich device but, there’s a little negligible problem: you can’t answer your calls. That happened to some users. The phone is ringing but nothing is shown on the screen. This is how one user explained the problem: </p>
<p> ”Since the Android update yesterday I go through periods where I cannot answer incoming calls. The phone rings but there is no indicator that there is an incoming call and icons or anything to even answer the incoming call. How do I correct this? I can restart my phone and I can answer incoming calls for a brief period then it start all over again where I can’t answer them. I have changed nothing on my phone. The only thing that has happened was the Android upgrade” </p>
<p> There’s an alternative, but the only permanent solution is a factory reset. At least, if you want to answer to your calls like you used to before the Nougat update. For an alternative solution, you can navigate to Settings > Accessibility > Answering and end calls > and enable “Answer calls by pressing the home key”. </p>
<p> However, you can perform a factory reset and have a good chance of resolving this issue. This is how to do it: </p>
<p> Backup your data and make sure that the phone’s battery is at least on 30%. </p>
<p> Open Backup & restore. </p>
<p> Tap Reset device. </p>
<p> Tap Erase everything. </p>
<p> Your device will restart and you should be able to answer calls just like before an update. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Even the fundamental connectivity was struck down for some users. Namely, some of them reported that they were unable to connect to both home or public networks after the update. One user offered a concise description of the problem at hand: </p>
<p> ”Got the new Android upday today (I have an S6) and tonight I couldn’t connect to a public Wi-Fi network. How do i fix this? I had no issues connecting before the update.” </p>
<p> These are some steps you should take in order to address the Wi-Fi issues: </p>
<p> Restart the router. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, make sure to address the issue to your carrier support center. </p>
<p> Camera issues </p>
<p> It seems that some of the native camera features are gone with the latest update. Allegedly, after the update, some users lost filters that were available on the previous Android version. This is how one user described his/her concerns regarding the subject: </p>
<p> ”I’ve only had my phone running for a day with the latest update, but the grayscale camera filter seems to be MIA and the low light resolution is sub par now. I always found the grayscale filter to give better photos in low light, so even though I can edit a color photo to make it grey…it’s not at all the same. I don’t see grayscale as an option for a filter to download, but has anyone else run into this and found a solution?” </p>
<p> As you would imagine, there isn’t a practical workaround for this. However, you can use an alternative app before the next system update to utilize your camera’s full potential with all the needed features. </p>
<p> Buttons/keys issues </p>
<p> Another key feature (no pun intended) is broken for some users. Namely, the Power and Home keys are unresponsive for some users periodically after the update rollout. This is how one S6 owner explained his problem and the way her/he resolved it: </p>
<p> ”After the Nougat update my power button intermittently stopped working, i.e. unable to turn screen on or if it is on, turn it off. Holding it down does nothing. After charging it for a bit, the problem seemed to go away. It was over 60% charged when I noticed the problem. Similarly, the home button either did nothing or opened Google assistant (did not hold the button, simply tapped it). I powered off and on. I cleared the cache. Yet the problem still persisted. For NOW, it seems to have returned to working normally. Only thing I did was let it charge for about 30 minutes during a car ride. There is something unstable in the code.’‘ </p>
<p> As you can see, this issue is somehow resolved by charging. On the other hand, if this strange occurrence is still there after a while, you should perform the factory reset. </p>
<p> Battery issues </p>
<p> Battery drains aren’t exactly a novelty for Samsung updates. After the S7 and S7 Edge battery issues, the battery life is substantially decreased on S6, as well. One user shared a thorough explanation behind this issue: </p>
<p> ”I’ve had my Samsung Galaxy S6 for around 16 months now. It seems like over the past 3-4 months the battery life has gotten worse, I’ve experienced a weird problem a few times too. Today, I was surprised look at my phone and see that the battery life was much lower than it should have been, since I had not been using my phone, it had just been in my pocket. Looking at the battery life chart in settings confirmed that there was a sudden drop in battery life a couple hours ago.” </p>
<p> As you can see for yourself, sudden drops of battery percentage are not uncommon after the update. However, you can perform a few tweaks to improve your battery life and those can be found in this article. </p>
<p> Wireless charging issues </p>
<p> Wireless charging is also impacted by the update. Some users reported that they’re unable to charge their devices with wireless chargers as soon as the system updated. One user summarized the problem this way: </p>
<p> ”Is anyone else having a problem with wireless charging after Nougat update? I keep my wireless charger on my desk at work. I did my update and then left. Came in the next day and the wireless isnt charging. Its not the charger because someone with an S7 and S8 have both tested it and they can charge on it. Any one else having this problem ?” </p>
<p> If you’re certain that the wireless charger is functional, you can wipe the cache partition and, if that’s not of any use, restore the factory settings. </p>
<p> Reboot/boot loop issues </p>
<p> Now, this is a dealbreaker for most of the users. Once they’ve installed the Nougat update, their respective devices get stuck on the welcome screen or the random resets started. One user presented the problem he has to cope with after the update: </p>
<p> ”Hi, I tried to update my firmware with the new Nougat upgrade last night. When I retrieved my phone this morning, it was frozen on the Verizon screen. I tried all of the tricks: rebooting the system, rebooting to bootloader, wiping the cache partition, and even doing a hard factory reset. Nothing has worked – not even the factory reset! It still freezes on the Verizon screen. Any advice for a self fix before I take it to a repair shop? Thanks!” </p>
<p> It seems that there’s no solution at the moment, at least not the one that can be performed by users themselves. So, if you’ve experienced similar issues, make sure to take your device to a service center. </p>
<p> Voicemail issues </p>
<p> This issue is not as much connected to a voicemail as it is an interface bug that causes the message playback to stop after the phone is close to your ear. It seems that the sensor bug affects the voicemail playback. Here is the description of the problem provided by one user: </p>
<p> ”I have visual voicemail and anytime I hit play and then put the phone to my ear to listen to the message the message pauses. The only way for me to listen to the voicemail is to put it on speaker phone. Anybody know a fix to this?” </p>
<p> Until now, the 3 workarounds proven as the best-suited for the job. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Voicemail app > Force stop, and restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable all lock screen security measures (pattern, PIN, password). </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> But, for most of the users, the problem is still there. So, we should expect some fixes in the upcoming app and system versions. </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> At the end, it’s important to say that some of these may be the isolated cases and the Nougat update work’s as intended on your Samsung handset. However, there’s also a possibility that we missed some of the issues, so you’re welcome to share them in the comments section. </p>
<p> Either way, we certainly hope that the Samsung and the carriers will work their way out of this in the next update that’s at the moment in the beta stage. </p>

<p> Hi There, I’m having issues with game apps. I play games like Cookie Jam and Farm Heroes and mid-play the app just goes black… most times it eventually comes back to life, sometimes I have to shut the app down. I also have issues with Amber Alerts… the alert buzzes which is fine but sometimes, the buzz continues even if I hit the X key to close the message. Any idea if they are looking at all the issues noted above? Appreciate forums like this to vent and get advice 🙂 </p>

<p> Since the May update, I can’t record video on my S6 without audio issues, mainly crackling noise and distorted audio. I’ve tried various suggestions to rectify the issue, but nothing works. Is there anything I can do? </p>

<p> Sometime after the update, I noticed that when on mobile data, Messenger loads real slowly, Facebook is very inconsistent, and Internet Browser does not work at all. Everything works normally when on wifi at home though… Apparently my sister has been having the same issue… </p>

<p> Hello, I don’t know if anyone can help with me with this issue but I’ll give it a try. I’ve got a S6 edge 64GB which had no problems when running with Android 6. But since I installed the update for Android 7, I’ve got freezing/crashing issues with several messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Telegram and even the Facebook app. While I’m typing in a message, suddenly the keyboard and the app freezes and crashes. After that the system gives me the option to restart the app or send a report. I already tried out the factory reset (deleted all the… Read more » </p>
<p> I solved the problem. It seems that it was caused by the Samsung keyboard. I use the Google keyboard “Gboard” since yesterday and had no crashes/freezes till now. So if anyone faces the same issues, try using another keyboard than the one from Samsung. </p>
<p> Download it from Google Playstore and install it. After installation, you go to the extended menu (where all apps are ordered alphabetically) and click on the “GBoard” logo, there you can set it as standard keyboard. Note: You can’t set it as standard keyboard in Samsung keyboard settings – at least I couldn’t. I had to do this via the settings menu of the GBoard App. </p>
<p> but mobile freezes on the T mobile logo, how to go to play store? DUDE! </p>

<p> I have an S6 Edge (SM G925T) TMobile that has lost bluetooth with the Nougat update. I have done resets, cache clear, safe mode, partition removal, etc and I can get it back for short period. Once I use the phone BT will quit. If I restart phone once BT is functioning it is off again. IF someoen will tell where to throw it I want to write a note and tie it to a rock and let Google know what I think…. </p>
<p> Still not working. Thank you Google for killing a very important feature of my phone. Samsung should be at bat for its customers. Apple has issues but they fix them to get full function back ASAP. How do you think this issue affects my thoughts on next consumer electronics purchase? I have house full of low performing Samsung appliances and now a phone that will not let me legally use it via a BT hands-free connection in my vehicles. </p>

<p> I have an ATT S6 Edge Plus. Loved it for over a year… After the recent nougat update, I’ve had terrible connectivity issues. Anything that transmits basically. Wifi, 4g, data… text messages just spin in limbo, phone signals are poor, and regular data… where I used to be strong, is non-existant. Was in a waiting room looking atound at everyone happily scrolling through facebook, messaging, watching vids… and mine says “offline”… what happened? Also… while texting… text locks up and I have to wait for it to catch up… then can continue texting. Frustrating. </p>

<p> My galaxy s6 says invalid sim and cant find mobile network option no more after I typed the code ##72786#, I tried restoring factory settings but still can’t find the mobile network option </p>
<p> Not having any of those issues but I am having issues in calls. I.e. I can be heard perfectly but I can only hear intermittent words from those calling me. It’s only been happening since the update. I have faith Tory tester bit it’s still happening ?! </p>
<p> Both my (S6 Edge) and my wife’s (S6) Samsung phones after Nougat update is facing some weird issues. The issue is essentially that when you are talking on speaker phone, the phone screen will not turn off even when you press the power button. It turns back on automatically. After some troubleshooting, is seems to be appearing when WhatsApp is installed. I have found this out after hardware reset and installing one app at a time. Does anyone else have this issue? We are also facing not being able to receive phone calls and not being able to send text… Read more » </p>
<p> Thanks for sharing. We don’t think that the restoring from backup will affect your troubleshooting. But it’s indeed strange for WhatsApp to cause those kinds of problems. Please, give us a shout after if you discover the instigator of the mentioned issues. Meanwhile, we’ll look into that and respond if some solution appears. </p>
<p> So, quick update. So, far it still seems to be working great without WhatsApp. My phone screen stays off during speaker phone call as well as Bluetooth calls in cars (forgot to mention this in earlier post). Actually, this screen staying on was actually found in three different places. 1) During phone call when phone is either in speaker or not in speaker and placed on the desk. Once again even when you pressed power off it did not stay off. 2) Phone call over Bluetooth in car. Screen will not go off and comes right back on after screen… Read more » </p>
<p> Thanks again for sharing. We don’t have the slightest idea why would the WhatsApp affect your phone in such a manner. </p>
<p> I too am experiencing What’s App related issues on my S6.I can only send or receive one or two messages before it freezes then crashes. I have tried all the solutions, back-up and factory reset, reinstallation of app etc and I am getting a bit cheesed off restarting my handset every 30 mins. Should I just delete Whats app altogether? Also have camera freeze, and phone does not ring on incoming calls, even though ringer is on full and settings are right. All this since the update…I want my old S6 back! </p>

<p> Android O Developer Preview: Known Issues and Bugs Round-Up </p>
<p> Even though a lot of Android users are still waiting for an update to Nougat 7.0, Google announced brand new OS. Android Oreo or Oreos is the 8th Android installment and should be available for consumers in August or September 2017. </p>
<p> For the time being, Google released Developers Preview version that should showcase upcoming features. It’s available only for Google-powered devices, namely for: </p>
<p> Pixel </p>
<p> Nexus Player </p>
<p> So if you have one of these models, you can try out Android O. However, have in mind that this is not a stable version and you can encounter a large variety of issues. For that purpose, we listed some of the known issues for this preview release, so you can know what to expect. </p>
<p> Known issues of Android O Developer Preview </p>
<p> System User Interface Issues </p>
<p> With Android O, Google conducted various changes and improvements with UI. Sadly, you may have a hard time experiencing those when we consider these reported issues: </p>
<p> ”System UI crash after toggling screen brightness, then going to Overview (recent) and selecting a new app. </p>
<p> Occasional issues navigating Home, with incomplete transition making the device unusable. </p>
<p> Taps in Quick Settings may be registered in another location. </p>
<p> When using Autofill, an “Android system app displaying on top” message is sometimes shown, but it can be ignored (if it’s turned off, it will disable Autofill).” </p>
<p> Google Cloud Messaging/Firebase Cloud Messaging </p>
<p> Cloud Messaging is also unstable in this preview version. These are the problems that occurred with some users: </p>
<p> ”FCM doesn’t work in a secondary profile unless the app is also installed on the primary profile. If the app is not installed on the primary profile, an FCM token is not generated in the secondary profile. </p>
<p> Developers using FCM/GCM with Android O should update their Google Play services SDK to version 10.2.1, which is available from the SDK manager in Android Studio.” </p>
<p> Android TV Issues </p>
<p> The Nexus Player has specific issues on its own. We are bringing you whole detailed list below. </p>
<p> ”Setting up a restricted profile then restarting the device causes the device to be unusable. </p>
<p> Typing in the search bar causes a crash. </p>
<p> PIP image does not fill the window. </p>
<p> Launching applications via voice command does not work. </p>
<p> Application size is not displayed in Application Settings. </p>
<p> Microphone button on remote control does not work. </p>
<p> Factory reset does not work on Fugu. </p>
<p> Connected remote control device disconnects intermittently. </p>
<p> USB connected drive cannot be formatted. The Setup as device storage formatting option does not work properly for drive attached via USB. </p>
<p> Device may freeze with blank homescreen when plug is inserted. </p>
<p> Location status in Settings may become disabled with user unable to re-enable. </p>
<p> Not able to reorder games in the apps and games row. </p>
<p> Content may not play after relaunching media apps.” </p>
<p> Android for Work and Device Manager Issues </p>
<p> Android for Work is a great feature that let you create and manage work-specific profile separately from the private one. At the moment, there is a single reported issue regarding Android for Work. </p>
<p> ”Enabling a Work Profile may cause a crash in Settings app. To work around this issue, remove and re-add the Work Profile.” </p>
<p> Besides that, users reported occasional crashes while trying to access the Device Manager. </p>
<p> ”Selecting the Settings > Security and Screen Lock > Android Device Manager menu item may cause a crash. Updating to the latest version of Google Play services will resolve this issue.” </p>
<p> Android Wear Issues </p>
<p> Besides handsets and Android TV, Android Wear has also support trough Android Emulator System Images. However, it’s not without issues. </p>
<p> ”Embedded app installation from Play Store can sometimes crash. Side-loading can be used to work around this issue. </p>
<p> Only the x86 emulator is currently supported. </p>
<p> Default watch face complications may not load until you switch watch faces or otherwise touch watch face settings, or reboot the device.” </p>
<p> Wi-Fi Issues </p>
<p> With Android O, Wi-Fi will receive additional interesting features. Additionally, there is one distinguished error and it’s concerning special services calls. </p>
<p> ”611 call can’t be made on a Wi-Fi profile.” </p>
<p> Performance and Battery Issues </p>
<p> As you would expect, this is release is not advisable for everyday use. It is quite buggy and unstable performance-wise. </p>
<p> ”System and app performance is known to be periodically slow / janky, and device may become occasionally unresponsive. These problems may become more acute with prolonged use. </p>
<p> Some apps may not function normally on Developer Preview 1. This includes Google’s apps as well as other apps. </p>
<p> This release has various stability and performance issues on all devices that make it not suitable for daily use on phone or tablet, especially for non-developers.” </p>
<p> Moreover, the same goes for battery. If you are willing to try out Android O Developer Preview, prepare for battery drainage. </p>
<p> ”Battery life may be regressed in this early release for screen-on and screen-off use cases.” </p>
<p> And with the lack of percentage that is removed from UI, you won’t be able to determine consumption as easily as before. </p>
<p> Other Issues </p>
<p> Besides best-known issues, you may face a variety of secondary issues related to lack of optimization. Don’t forget that some of the apps/features you may use are still not compatible with novelties that Android O brings to the table. </p>
<p> ”Using the Google Drive app’s PDF viewer to load a PDF document may cause the device to freeze. </p>
<p> Apps or games may hit ANRs in GLThread, such as with , that cause crash or failure to load properly. </p>
<p> Games using Google Play games services may have problems with sign-in. </p>
<p> The latest release of Android Auto may not work properly on Developer Preview 1. </p>
<p> The NDK cannot build targeting Android O DP1 (an upcoming r15 release will fix).” </p>
<p> Have in mind that these are only the ‘noticed’ issues since we are too early in this release phase. So, a large variety of unlisted issues can occur. Additionally, features like Android Pay are not available due to security reasons. </p>
<p> At the end, unless you’re a developer or knowledgeable enthusiast, we don’t advise you to install Developers Preview. Soon enough we should be able to download Beta version with CTS (Compatibility Test Suite) approval. That should be much safer to work with. </p>
<p> What are your first thoughts on Android O? What are the changes you eagerly await? </p>
<p> Lots of strange bluetooth issues on my Nexus 6P – none of which I had on Android 7.x. I did the OTA Beta. </p>

<p> I went on here to see if anyone’s settings app crashes when opened Everytime. The only way I can get in there is though quick toggles and if I’m in airplane mode. WiFi and Bluetooth can be on but not service (cumsumer Cellular) hate it dont use switching to project fi when the Sim comes in. Other then that a super stable experience </p>

<p> Using Pixel XL, and since Android O the Google App itself is incredibly unstable. Most notably and specifically, the Assistant freezes the Google app upon a command (such as “call xyz”, or “send text to xyz”. The Google App freezes, then force close. </p>

<p> Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> For a few years, Asus brings an interesting line of devices to the grand Android market. The Asus ZenFone 5 is the latest addition in their main iteration line, but there’s a device which took its glory, and it’s their own device called Max Pro M1. Besides the large battery and a fairly long name, this handset has everything a budget device (we can argue the M1 is a mid-range handset) should have. And, like any other handset, it has it’s small but visible flaws, bugs, and temporary (or permanent) problems. </p>
<p> We made sure to showcase the most prominent issues (apologies if we skipped on something). In addition, we enlisted some general troubleshooting steps for every issue. The advanced troubleshooting procedures are explained in detail at the bottom of the article. </p>
<p> 1: Multitouch/Ghost touch touchscreen issues </p>
<p> One would assume that the modern touchscreen panels won’t share the same issues with the ones from 10 years ago, Sadly, that’s not the case. Multitouch and ghost touch (delayed reaction or false touch) are the most prominently-reported issues on the ZenFone Max Pro M1. </p>
<p> Users are not sure whether the software or hardware is to be blamed for the aforementioned problems, and the support on the official forum isn’t exactly eager to jump in and provide the solution. </p>
<p> We have some solutions we can suggest but bear in mind that these won’t help if the touchscreen panel is faulty. Here’s what you can do to address the multitouch/ghost touch issues on the ZenFone Max Pro M1: </p>
<p> Disable Zen Motion Gestures. </p>
<p> Run the device in a safe mode. </p>
<p> 2: Slowdowns and freezes </p>
<p> The Snapdragon 363 and the more than capable GPU should provide users with a seamless use and a snappy experience. Of course, we’re looking at a lower mid-range device, so it’s unrealistic to expect ultra-high settings in some demanding games. Nonetheless, some users reported slouchy rendering and even lags during the standard use which shouldn’t be the case. </p>
<p> We have a few ways to reduce lags. Here’s what you can try: </p>
<p> Clear cache from the app which freezes the most. </p>
<p> Disable apps from working in the background. Greenify should serve the purpose. </p>
<p> Update your device for a possible update fix. </p>
<p> Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 3: Main and front camera issues </p>
<p> The camera is the main distinctive point between a flagship and a budget device. The camera setup on the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 is exactly what you can expect from a lower mid-range handset. Good enough on the daily light, with the dual-camera setup behind and 8 MP front lens. </p>
<p> Not bad at all and up to the trend. However, some users had issues with the camera app. Some of them experienced crashes while others are just not satisfied with the way taken photos are looking. For the former, we can blame the software. For the latter, the only resolution is to await updates or use a Google Camera port. </p>
<p> Boot into Safe mode and test the camera. </p>
<p> Clear Camera app’s data. </p>
<p> Update the device. </p>
<p> 4: Battery depletes fast </p>
<p> If we need to single out one selling point for this handset, we must say it’s the battery. The 5000 mAh battery is an amazing asset and the main reason why, even with the 6-inch display, the M1 has an astounding screen-on time. However, some users are not satisfied with the way the device works in the idle mode. Supposedly, the battery depletes substantially overnight, while the handset is completely idle. </p>
<p> But, don’t worry, this is most certainly related to software and we have a few tweaks which should reduce the battery consumption. </p>
<p> Kill the background apps with the built-in Manager. The aforementioned Greenify or a similar app might help to tweak the app’s behavior while working in the background, too. </p>
<p> Disable the Adaptive brightness and dim the brightness manually. </p>
<p> Disable Mobile Data Always On in the Developer Options menu. </p>
<p> Remove the unused widgets. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi overnight. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings after a system update. </p>
<p> 5: Wi-Fi and Mobile Data not working </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues are not as common on the Asus’ handset as on some other devices, but we still run into some reports and couldn’t skip on mentioning them. In the said reports, users were suffering from an unstable network reception on both Wi-Fi and Mobile Data, respectively. </p>
<p> Here are some steps to address this: </p>
<p> Delete all networks and try reconnecting. </p>
<p> Disable Always On for Mobile Data in Developer options. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Reset App preferences. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6: The fingerprint sensor is slow/unresponsive </p>
<p> We already wrote about the fingerprint issues on Asus ZenFone 3 and the ways to resolve them. This seems to be an ache for Asus, but that’s not a rule of thumb. It might be some an unfortunate coincidence. Either way, a few of ZenFone Max Pro M1 users have had a hard time with an unresponsive fingerprint scanner. Others aren’t satisfied with the speed it offers when unlocking the device. </p>
<p> We can’t make it work faster, but some of these steps might help you get it to work in the first place: </p>
<p> Run the diagnostic to determine what’s the nature of the problem. The .12345+= code typed in your dialer should start the fingerprint scanner diagnostics. </p>
<p> Re-configure the fingerprint. </p>
<p> Try booting into Safe mode and, if the fingerprint performs better, uninstall all recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Remove the tempered glass or cases which may cover the fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Clean the fingerprint sensor from a debris and greasy dirt with a wet cloth. </p>
<p> Reset your handset to factory settings. </p>
<p> 7: Auto-brightness doesn’t work </p>
<p> The auto-brightness or, what Google likes to call it, Adaptive brightness is an important built-in feature, especially as the screens are getting bigger and consuming more battery. It regulates the screen brightness based on the front ambient sensor readings. Some users had issues with the said sensor, as the screen fails to dim in the darker surroundings. </p>
<p> Here’s what you can do to address this: </p>
<p> Disable Adaptive brightness and restart your device. Re-enable it again. </p>
<p> Clean the front-facing top bezel where the sensor resides. </p>
<p> 8: Sound issues </p>
<p> Sound issues are also not as prominent, but some users are still experiencing bad sound output, especially on headphones. Others, and which might be a more delicate problem, have had a problem with the distorted in-call sound. This might be a result of a bad reception, but we still recommend checking some of the solutions we provided for general sound problems. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to improve the sound output on the ZenFone Max Pro M1: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Disable Absolute volume in Developer options. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> 9: Display color issues </p>
<p> Based on a few trusted reviews, the 6-inch LCD display on the Max Pro M1 is quite good. However, there are some isolated nuisances some users reported. This one single problem is rare but we still decided to put it on the list. Just in case. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to resolve the problem with the display color issues on the M1: </p>
<p> Disable Nightlight. </p>
<p> Change the color temperature to default or try Cool. </p>
<p> Boot into a safe mode and look for changes. </p>
<p> Reset the phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> 10: Important troubleshooting procedures for Zenfone Max Pro M1 </p>
<p> How to enable Developers options </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open System settings. </p>
<p> Choose About phone. </p>
<p> Locate the build number and tap on it 7 times to enable the Developer options menu. </p>
<p> Boot into Safe mode </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button until the Power menu appears. </p>
<p> Now, press and hold the Power button again until the “Reboot to safe mode” message appears. </p>
<p> Tap OK. </p>
<p> If the device works without restarting for some time, we suggest following the next steps. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition data </p>
<p> Shut down your handset. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and the Volume Down key until the device starts. </p>
<p> Use Volume keys (Up and Down) to navigate through the menu until you reach Recovery mode. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to choose the Recovery mode. </p>
<p> Once you see the Android with the exclamation mark, press and hold the Power button and, while holding it, single-press the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> Use Volume keys again to navigate through the Recovery menu and highlight ”wipe cache partition”. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to select it and confirm if asked. </p>
<p> The procedure should start and it will last for approximately 10 minutes. </p>
<p> Open Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> The device will restart and all your settings will be restored to default values. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this list of issues. We’ll try our best to add more issues over time, but you can help us, as well. Share your problems with Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 in the comments section below. We would be thankful for your effort. </p>

<p> Fix: OK Google doesn’t work after Android Oreo update </p>
<p> Android Oreo is finally here for some Pixel and Nexus devices. While Google promises the new Android version will improve the overall performance of your phone, it appears that’s not exactly the case. Because people have already encountered various issues caused by Android O. </p>
<p> According to some reports, Android Oreo breaks the OK Google feature on some devices. Even though everything was fine in Android Nougat, users are now unable to perform some sound commands. </p>
<p> I’ve searched online for potential solutions, and as it appears, there’s a way to fix the problem. Unlike some other issues, that users basically have to wait for Google to fix them through updates. So, Let’s see what can we do about OK Google issues in Android O. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Retrain OK Google </p>
<p> The solution that helped the majority of Android users with the OK Google problem is simply retraining the assistant. It looks like installing the update somehow disrupted the assistant, so retraining is needed. </p>
<p> In case you’re not sure how to retrain Google Assistant, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Go to Apps & notifications > expand Advanced > Default apps > Assist & voice input </p>
<p> Tap the settings (gear) icon next to Assist app </p>
<p> Go to “Ok Google” detection </p>
<p> Now, choose Delete voice model, to reset Google Now settings </p>
<p> After that, choose Retrain voice model </p>
<p> Finish the training </p>
<p> That’s all. After re-training your assistant, Google Now should be working seamlessly once again. However, if re-training didn’t get the job done, move on to the next solution. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check your language settings </p>
<p> There’s also a slight chance installing Android Oreo corrupted your language settings. So, check if your Voice language matches your system language, to be sure Google Now will work well. </p>
<p> To check Voice language settings, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Go to Apps & notifications > expand Advanced > Default apps > Assist & voice input </p>
<p> Tap the settings (gear) icon next to Assist app </p>
<p> Tap Languages </p>
<p> Make sure the right language is selected </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Check for updates </p>
<p> And finally, maybe the update itself disrupt Google Now, with some internal bug. That’s not the case with the Nexus and Pixel devices, but could be with other manufacturers (this article was written at the time when only Nexus and Pixel devices had Android Oreo). </p>
<p> If the update indeed caused the problem, Google will eventually acknowledge the issue, and release a fixing patch. So, if you’ve tried both of the abovementioned solutions, and still have problems with Google Now assistant, make sure your phone is up to date. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I certainly hope at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the problem with OK Google after installing the Oreo update. If not, let me know in the comments below, or reach me out on Twitter. </p>

<p> Further to this issue here’s the fix. Go to the Google app and uninstall updates. Then you will be prompted to set up the app again and do voice training. It will ask you to say “OK GOOGLE” 3 times and then it is trained and works to unlock the phone using the Smart lock feature in settings under security. Auto updates will then update all associated apps and functions. Once this is done you will get a notification that Hey Google voice commands are available. DO NOT DO THIS AND JUST CLEAR THAT NOTIFICATION. The smart lock voice identification… Read more » </p>

<p> I have 3 brand new pixel 2 xl and all 3 voice trained during initial set up and then all 3 voice for smart lock turned off and couldn’t be retrained. Google assistant still responds to ok Google properly. Google support doesn’t acknowledge there is a problem so I say let’s every pixel owner return for a refund and buy a Samsung or other phone. Bet they find a fix real fast if this happens. </p>

<p> Thanks for the help, but I am experiencing the exact same issue as Stephen in the comments. I can’t even make it to the suggested steps as my OK Google detection is entirely turned off and when I try to re-enable it, I just get a loading screen and then after about 15 seconds I get a window saying that I can’t connect (My Network is working at 100%). Very frustrating but I can hold out for an Update Fix as long as I know it’s an issue being addressed. My phone is an Original Pixel XL on Verizon. </p>

<p> After 8.1 it doesn’t work at all. I can’t even turn okay google detection on anymore it is just permanently greyed out. I guess google is taking a page out of apples playbook and taking features away from customers in order to press them to buy the new phone </p>

<p> I was quite happy with 8.0, after the upgrade to 8.1 I found that the voice assistant’s operation erratic. Frequently, it will respond to the OK Google and then not do anything thereafter. What is annoying is that I’ve become rather dependent on it and now have to go back to the old fashioned way. BTW, I have a first gen Pixel XL. </p>

<p> Here’s why you can’t disable Adaptive Icons in Android Oreo </p>
<p> Android 8 Oreo is far from a revolutionary OS that brings your wildest fantasies about future tech to life. In fact, Google focuses on the back-end here. Most changes were made under the hood, so an average user coming from Android Nougat can barely see the difference. </p>
<p> That’s why users who care about their phones debate about some ‘less important’ features way more than they would if there were some game-changers involved. </p>
<p> A particular feature that people usually complain about is the Adaptive Icons. In fact, I’ve barely seen a positive review of this feature. This tells us one thing. Android Oreo users are divided into two groups – those who hate Adaptive Icons and those who simply don’t care enough to talk about them. </p>
<p> Since the second group probably won’t even bother to search for this article, it’s for all of you who have a feud with Adaptive Icons in Android Oreo. For all of you who are frustrated for being trapped with Adaptive Icons and don’t really get why it has to be that way. </p>
<p> We’ll discuss it all here. </p>
<p> Why are Adaptive Icons there in the first place? </p>
<p> Unlike iOS, where Apple pretty much controls the whole ecosystem, Android (being an open source OS) gives each member of its family more liberties. Individually, that’s a great thing. But it may not be beneficial for the greater good. </p>
<p> Developers have the freedom to polish every single aspect of their apps to smallest details. Both in terms of aesthetics and functionality. But we’ll focus on the aesthetics here. Subjectively looking, even though a single app’s icon looks great, it may not fit in with the rest of the icons, giving your home screen an awkward uniquely biased look. </p>
<p> These inconsistencies usually irritate people. In fact, people have been complaining about this since the earliest days of Android. And the fact that different phones all have their own custom ROM brings even more inequality. </p>
<p> So, Google decided to normalize things by trying to satisfy everyone’s taste. That’s how the idea of the Adaptive Icons was born. In theory, the whole plan looks legit and doable. But the result we got with Android Oreo speaks differently. </p>
<p> What are Adaptive Icons </p>
<p> The biggest misconception people have about Adaptive Icons is that it’s a launcher or appearance customization feature. That’s not true. Adaptive Icons is a system feature that should make third-party apps’ icons in-line with default icons provided by OEM. </p>
<p> I won’t dig into technical details too much here, so here’s how Google explainsAdaptive Icons: </p>
<p> “Android 8.0 (API level 26) introduces adaptive launcher icons, which can display a variety of shapes across different device models. For example, an adaptive launcher icon can display a circular shape on one OEM device, and display a squircle on another device. Each device OEM provides a mask, which the system then uses to render all adaptive icons with the same shape. Adaptive launcher icons are also used in shortcuts, the Settings app, sharing dialogs, and the overview screen.” </p>
<p> In order to follow Google’s rules of Adaptive Icons developers have to submit their icons in two layers, a transparent foreground layer and a solid background layer. As explained above, the launcher then cuts the layers into a shape specified by OEM. </p>
<p> As the OS uses an already provided mask to shape the icons automatically, there’s nothing you can do about it. Even though you’re not satisfied with the outcome. It’s just how the system works. </p>
<p> Now you know that as long as you’re using Android Oreo, Adaptive Icons will be there. You can’t simply erase them from your phone in any way. But, there’s a way to at least change the appearance of Adaptive Icons on your phone. </p>
<p> Obviously, this can’t be done using your stock launcher, but if you really can’t stand the current look of Adaptive Icons on your phone, there’s a third-party solution. </p>
<p> Use Nova Launcher </p>
<p> Nova Launcher is arguably the most popular third-party launcher for Android. Mostly because of its wealth of customization features. This includes the ability to change the shape of Adaptive Icons, which was introduced last year. </p>
<p> So, if you want to at least do something about your ugly adaptive icons, you can change their shape. I know it’s not what you’re looking for, but it gives you some customization freedom. Here’s how to change Adaptive Icons in Nova Launcher: </p>
<p> Open Nova Launcher Settings. </p>
<p> Go to Look & Feel > Adaptive Icons. </p>
<p> Choose the preffered shape of Adaptive Icons. </p>
<p> That’s about it. It is a bare minimum, but at least you’re able to adjust the icons to a more likable shape. That’s better than not being able to do anything about Adaptive Icons at all. </p>
<p> As it appears, Google still hasn’t solved the problem with unbiased icons on various Android phones. But we have another Android version ahead of us. As we still don’t know what will the new version bring, we can only hope Google will introduce a more viable solution for icons on your Home screen. Hopefully a better one. </p>
<p> What do you think about Adaptive Icons in Android Oreo and the way they function? Let us know in the comments below. </p>
<p> Sign me up in the non-existent group that likes adaptive icons. I am looking forward to apps being forced onto Oreo in November so that my home screen can finally look neat and tidy. </p>

<p> I like the idea of adaptive icons, but google should polish the icons of its own apps. I have samsung phone, and they only put white background around old icons – it looks awfull, especially on home screen. </p>

<p> Looks like Facebook is the first to not ship with a Legacy icon.. shame </p>
<p> Thanks dy for the tip! Doesn’t work for all icons (especially Google’s own calendar, sigh) but does improve matters. I never minded the different icons, made stuff easier to find! I really can’t understand some of the decisions Google and Apple have made recently, just bad OS updates and ideas for ideas sake. /rant </p>
<p> You can just enable Labs in Nova by holding down Vol – while in the settings main page, then a new option, “Prefer legacy icons” will appear inside the Adaptive icons style settings </p>
<p> It does exactly what you want, unless the app dev puts a pseudo-adaptive icons there </p>
<p> Thank you for the tip on Labs. Fixed almost all my icons except google calendar and settings. </p>

<p> Huawei Honor 8 most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei has gained a lot of popularity lately with both Mate (flagship) and Honor (mid-range) series. Honor 8 is the latest addition to the list of mid-budget devices produced by the Chinese company. Upon presentation for the US and EU market, the phone received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, even though Honor 8 offers good performance for an affordable price, there are some common issues worth mentioning. Users reported various problems with both hardware and software. It seems that the producer addressed some of the problems, but there is a large number of those that they need to resolve. Today we listed for you the known issues and possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Video crash while playing </p>
<p> As some of the users stated, the Honor 8 have a lot of issues with the video playback or streaming. It seems that the video crashes and, on some occasion, a restart is the only solution to get things work again. According to them, the crash occurs in online or offline videos, regardless. On the other hand, the fundament of the problem is YouTube. </p>
<p> We have noticed that the problem is widespread and the main culprit is integration with third-party apps. For the standard videos, first and foremost is to check the format. Honor 8 supports these video formats: </p>
<p> WMV </p>
<p> RM </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the online streaming videos are the ones with issues, make sure that you reinstall the given app or try an alternative. It seems that the Honor 8 have a certain level off incompatibility with some of them. Additionally, if the problem is persistent, you should contact customers support and ask for a replace. </p>
<p> Video recording stutter in third-party apps </p>
<p> While this is not as crushing (no pun intended) as the previous issue, it can be as annoying. Namely, many users reported lag and stutter while recording videos on Snapchat or Instagram story. This often leads to unsynchronized audio and video. </p>
<p> This seems to be related to awkward camera overheating. You should check the top of your phone for temperature changes. If the phone’s temperature is normal, try restarting your phone and clearing the app cache and data. Moreover, you can check your battery temperature by typing this code in your dialer *#*#2846579#*#*. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the phone is overheated (and that seems to happen often with some users), you’ll have to let it cool down. The camera behavior is not a strong feature of this model since the following default software is underwhelming. We’ll have to wait and see are there any fixes prepared in the next update build. </p>
<p> 3G works instead LTE, WiFI won’t connect </p>
<p> Connectivity is a common issue with the Honor 8. A large number of users reported problems related both to Wi-Fi and data networks. The phone won’t connect to a known network for ages or it chooses 3G instead of much faster LTE. </p>
<p> You can try following workarounds for data network issue: </p>
<p> Switch Network type: Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings: Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and reestablish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> The Huawei confirmed that they are aware of the Wi-Fi issue. We can hope that they’ll fix it with the next patch. </p>
<p> Echo while calling </p>
<p> Some users reported a problem with in-call speaker and mic malfunction. According to them, they hear the echo while speaking on the phone. The issue is more present when the loudspeaker is ON. </p>
<p> This is a common issue with many Android-powered phones. Most of the time it is related to pre-installed Google app called TalkBack. Our advice is to turn it off. </p>
<p> No battery percentage was shown </p>
<p> Honor 8 isn’t presenting battery percentage on the home screen by default. Most of the users are accustomed to that feature and they want to enable it but don’t know how. And this is the simplest way: </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon. </p>
<p> In the upper right corner, you’ll see 3 icons. </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon that is in the middle. </p>
<p> Notifications are not displayed when screen is off </p>
<p> Some of the users were left in disbelief when their push notifications from various apps stopped. It can be a quite annoying experience that ruins all-around impression about the phone. Which is pretty great in all manners. </p>
<p> Huawei made a strange decision to improve battery life by completely disabling the notifications while the screen is off. Luckily, that can be changed in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Protected apps. </p>
<p> Add apps that you want to receive notifications from. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this article helpful. Additionally, we are sure that the phone will function much better once it gets updated to Nougat 7.0. The update cycle started on 10th February so be sure to check your phones. </p>

<p> I’ve got one more question, is Honor 8 moisture resistant? Not water, moisture, because i left my phone for several hours in my room which gets ton of moisture if i forget to turn on heating, and when i came back my phone was ice cold and had alot o moisture on the screen, thanks </p>
<p> On paper – yes. But we advise you not to hold your phone in that kind of surrounding for an extended period of time. One or two times shouldn’t make a difference or cause any hardware malfunction. You’re welcome, we are always glad to help. </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> Same issue. Mine flashes or lights up but no alert. When I open the messages, still doesn’t show. Then it crashes and upon opening the second time, the messages are there and it is usable. This tends to make the phone run hot and the batttery drains really quick. Rebooting doesn’t help </p>

<p> Lock screen issue iPhone 5s 11.1.2 lock screen gets stuck in landscape mode. Annoying af. Ugh and battery life doesn’t exist n e more. Maybe a hr or so. Come on apple step ur game up. </p>
<p> After updating my iPhone 7 Plus to iOS 11.1.2 and using it for few days I’ve found that the battery drain is more quickly than the iOS 10.3.3. But I think user face this problem only in beta version. And I would personally turn off Bluetooth and Wifi when not in use. </p>

<p> I have an iPhone 6s Plus and since the update , my phone gets a black screen and spinning wheel like it’s powering off . It only goes as far as closing any app I have open and then returns to a locked home screen. No apple logo or restart needed. It’s happened twice while writing this. </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> This shit ALWAYS happens with newer upgrades with new stuff for “older” phones. It’s planned obsolescence, never upgrade like this. </p>

<p> They don’t want you being able to use your 2 yr old phone for any longer than possible. </p>
<p> I had the same problem as other have reported. </p>
<p> I also changed to Skia a few days ago but when I checked again today it had changed back. Possibly because there was a security update that I installed yesterday tho, but it’s still annoyingly slow. </p>

<p> I dealt with this on my Nexus 5x and none of the fixes helped. The most annoying was that the camera took about 15 seconds to open up. Also an evident general battery drain. I tried to unenroll because I got Oreo on beta but apparently I was already off beta so there was no stable update back to Nougat. Instructions to downgrade to Nougat are intense. Last ditch effort I did a hard reset … And all is good! I also made the setting change in this article but don’t know if it’s necessary or not. Not it’s night… Read more » </p>

<p> Hello, well, you all have the phone slower but at least working. My Nexus 5x died after it updated to the f…ing Android Oreo. I don’t know what to do, there is a video about how to downgrade, but you need the phone ON </p>

<p> I’m glad that you made this post. Yes, it’s been awful. Even with the rendering changed, I’m still having problems typing this out. </p>
<p> I remember the same crap happened with my Nexus 4 and the Lollipop update. After a year or so, I installed Marshmallow (custom ROM) and it ran better than vanilla 5.1.1. </p>
<p> I think that’s going to be the route, this time. Hopefully Google releases 8.1 soon </p>

<p> I have got all these bugs you mentioned, tried switched to skia, but didn’t felt significant improvement. So then I went to settings, turned off all unnecessary apps including play game, play movies, play music, hangouts, turned open gl rendering on and after all my n5x works like a charm. </p>

<p> I just reset my phone yesterday due to lay. I hope this works, but my missing Google cards showed up immediately after changing the setting. Coincidence? Maybe, but…. Now to go back and enable “Turn on WiFi Automatically” which stopped working with Oreo! </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> December 16, 2017. Since putting 11.0 on my iPhone 6, battery drainage is ridiculous. Going to bed with it at 100%, all apps closed. Wake up to 55%. Last night I downloaded the latest, 11.2.1, in hopes of a fix. No luck. I am really starting to believe the rumors that Apple purposely does these things to force people to buy new phones after a certain length of time. I have been to 3 Apple Genius bars to no avail. Battery tested 3 times and it is fine. Every single help suggestion advises turning off certain settings, etc. Well, sounds… Read more » </p>

<p> Since updating to 11.2.2 on my iphone 6, the voicemail playback volume is VERY low, almost inaudible. Tech support unable to fix, (several attempts, ending in need for full restore) This at least resolved the other concern with my not hearing phone calls due to low phone call volume (tho volume control was set to highest level), but it has not resolved the voicemail issue. Tech said I had to go to store where they might take the phone and send back to factory (this is my only phone–need for work, etc. so this is not an option) I can’t… Read more » </p>

<p> My iPad Pro will not let me re-arrange apps. The screen flashes and the apps literally jump out of folders. When I try to get them back in the folder does the magnet repel thing. Rebooting does not solve the problem. The screen brightness lowers itself automatically. You can see the brightness contro moving itself even though is is not on auto-levels etc. The battery drain is dramatic as well. Where is any QC at Apple? </p>

<p> I have a Iphone 6+. my music app that come with the i phone keeps popping up on the screen and is useless. You can’t close it. It will play music that I have downloaded or purchased. Siri is slow to activate but that was from the update of 11. I’m not going to even try to update the ipad. Even people at apple could not get i to stay closed.

<p> Huawei Honor 8 most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei has gained a lot of popularity lately with both Mate (flagship) and Honor (mid-range) series. Honor 8 is the latest addition to the list of mid-budget devices produced by the Chinese company. Upon presentation for the US and EU market, the phone received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, even though Honor 8 offers good performance for an affordable price, there are some common issues worth mentioning. Users reported various problems with both hardware and software. It seems that the producer addressed some of the problems, but there is a large number of those that they need to resolve. Today we listed for you the known issues and possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Video crash while playing </p>
<p> As some of the users stated, the Honor 8 have a lot of issues with the video playback or streaming. It seems that the video crashes and, on some occasion, a restart is the only solution to get things work again. According to them, the crash occurs in online or offline videos, regardless. On the other hand, the fundament of the problem is YouTube. </p>
<p> We have noticed that the problem is widespread and the main culprit is integration with third-party apps. For the standard videos, first and foremost is to check the format. Honor 8 supports these video formats: </p>
<p> WMV </p>
<p> RM </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the online streaming videos are the ones with issues, make sure that you reinstall the given app or try an alternative. It seems that the Honor 8 have a certain level off incompatibility with some of them. Additionally, if the problem is persistent, you should contact customers support and ask for a replace. </p>
<p> Video recording stutter in third-party apps </p>
<p> While this is not as crushing (no pun intended) as the previous issue, it can be as annoying. Namely, many users reported lag and stutter while recording videos on Snapchat or Instagram story. This often leads to unsynchronized audio and video. </p>
<p> This seems to be related to awkward camera overheating. You should check the top of your phone for temperature changes. If the phone’s temperature is normal, try restarting your phone and clearing the app cache and data. Moreover, you can check your battery temperature by typing this code in your dialer *#*#2846579#*#*. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the phone is overheated (and that seems to happen often with some users), you’ll have to let it cool down. The camera behavior is not a strong feature of this model since the following default software is underwhelming. We’ll have to wait and see are there any fixes prepared in the next update build. </p>
<p> 3G works instead LTE, WiFI won’t connect </p>
<p> Connectivity is a common issue with the Honor 8. A large number of users reported problems related both to Wi-Fi and data networks. The phone won’t connect to a known network for ages or it chooses 3G instead of much faster LTE. </p>
<p> You can try following workarounds for data network issue: </p>
<p> Switch Network type: Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings: Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and reestablish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> The Huawei confirmed that they are aware of the Wi-Fi issue. We can hope that they’ll fix it with the next patch. </p>
<p> Echo while calling </p>
<p> Some users reported a problem with in-call speaker and mic malfunction. According to them, they hear the echo while speaking on the phone. The issue is more present when the loudspeaker is ON. </p>
<p> This is a common issue with many Android-powered phones. Most of the time it is related to pre-installed Google app called TalkBack. Our advice is to turn it off. </p>
<p> No battery percentage was shown </p>
<p> Honor 8 isn’t presenting battery percentage on the home screen by default. Most of the users are accustomed to that feature and they want to enable it but don’t know how. And this is the simplest way: </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon. </p>
<p> In the upper right corner, you’ll see 3 icons. </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon that is in the middle. </p>
<p> Notifications are not displayed when screen is off </p>
<p> Some of the users were left in disbelief when their push notifications from various apps stopped. It can be a quite annoying experience that ruins all-around impression about the phone. Which is pretty great in all manners. </p>
<p> Huawei made a strange decision to improve battery life by completely disabling the notifications while the screen is off. Luckily, that can be changed in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Protected apps. </p>
<p> Add apps that you want to receive notifications from. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this article helpful. Additionally, we are sure that the phone will function much better once it gets updated to Nougat 7.0. The update cycle started on 10th February so be sure to check your phones. </p>

<p> Hi, i got quite an annoying issue with my Honor 8. Pretty much every time i connect my headphones it activates some voice activated search app, and also turns the volume up and down, pauses music and hangs up calls and changes songs when i listen to music. This only happens when the headphones are plugged in, and ive tried with several different ones. I would be very grateful if anyone could tell me what’s wrong, thanks 🙂 </p>

<p> Hello! I am currently having the issue that my screen is sometimes nonresponsive to the touch. Even after turning the phone on and off and closing all the open programs, it still has a huge lag or opens things when I’m attempting to scroll. When this is happening, it also won’t identify my fingerprints. Any advice? </p>

<p> Hi, I have had a Honor 8 for a few months now. Today it restarted during a jogging trip. When I got home I tried to turn it back on, but it was completely dead. Have tried to charge it, hold power button in 30 seconds, power + volume up / down for many seconds, but nothing happens. Please help how to resolve. </p>

<p> Hi, I am having problems with my Honor 8. I just got my phone on May, and as of today, I am experiencing problems when it comes to uninstall applications. My home-screen is in Drawer Mode, so you need to press the main button to access all the apps. When I try to uninstall an application, it does it correctly, but then appears a message saying “Drag empty area to move the page position” and because this message appears in the middle of nowhere, I cannot enter to my apps, and it seems like the screen frozens The only thing… Read more » </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> Switch the GPU Renderer from ‘OpenGL’ to skia (the old one). There is apparently some issue with the OpenGL renderer on Oreo on 5x. Using the old one would make your device quick and sharp again. </p>
<p> Hey great shout. I just did this and it has improved the performance substantially. Still not perfect but much more usable now. Thank you very much! </p>
<p> Thank you, this worked an absolute treat! Had to Google how to enable the developer options first though 🙂 </p>
<p> Thank you SO MUCH! This was driving me utterly bananas! </p>

<p> Same things here. Phone is laggy, keyboard disappearing every time when using it. While playing movies, they just freeze for seconds. Changing to skia from opengl didn’t solve my problems. Just annoying. :'( </p>

<p> Same for me. I wish I didn’t install it. I got a Nexus because I wanted a pure Android experience but if they don’t fix it soon I’ll have to go for a custom rom </p>
<p> Its unbelievably slow. Glad I’m not the only one I was going crazy. Funny thing is, right after a fresh install it was fine, but now it’s almost unusable … As I’m typing my words are showing up 3-4 seconds after ive keyed them in…. </p>

<p> Same here – phone almost unusable. Google Maps Navigation is torture since it freezes and crashes randomly along with showing a greatly magnified portion of the map with no controls on the screen while navigating. Nothing to do but pull over and reboot in the middle of a trip. Cray cray. </p>

<p> Still haven’t been offered an OTA update to Oreo on my 5x (Google fi) was really annoyed since I thought it should have been available in the first week or two after release but after reading this maybe I’ll hold off if it does ever show up. Keep posting and updating so the rest of us know whether to update or not when it’s available. </p>

<p> My Nexus 5x was working fine until I updated, now it is very slow. Most noticable is switching between apps. running/using an app still works fine though. Also, opening the camera takes a long time and when going to video mode half the screen goes black for a rather long time. The performance after the update is in other words very bad. Saw that others have done a roll-back which is what I will do aswell. </p>

<p> I had Oreo on my 5x for two days. Super laggy, despite the “fix”. Just unenrolled from the beta and back to 7.1.2. Much better. </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> After the update, I am only able to use 1 sim. the other has no signal though you can see it as available whenever you check on the dual sim card settings. I have done factory reset, changed sims and still have the same issue.. I asked asus cs and recommended bringing it to the service center. Do I just have to wait for the next update and try if it will work then? </p>

On the other hand, the fundament of the problem is YouTube. </p>
<p> We have noticed that the problem is widespread and the main culprit is integration with third-party apps. For the standard videos, first and foremost is to check the format. Honor 8 supports these video formats: </p>
<p> WMV </p>
<p> RM </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the online streaming videos are the ones with issues, make sure that you reinstall the given app or try an alternative. It seems that the Honor 8 have a certain level off incompatibility with some of them. Additionally, if the problem is persistent, you should contact customers support and ask for a replace. </p>
<p> Video recording stutter in third-party apps </p>
<p> While this is not as crushing (no pun intended) as the previous issue, it can be as annoying. Namely, many users reported lag and stutter while recording videos on Snapchat or Instagram story. This often leads to unsynchronized audio and video. </p>
<p> This seems to be related to awkward camera overheating. You should check the top of your phone for temperature changes. If the phone’s temperature is normal, try restarting your phone and clearing the app cache and data. Moreover, you can check your battery temperature by typing this code in your dialer *#*#2846579#*#*. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the phone is overheated (and that seems to happen often with some users), you’ll have to let it cool down. The camera behavior is not a strong feature of this model since the following default software is underwhelming. We’ll have to wait and see are there any fixes prepared in the next update build. </p>
<p> 3G works instead LTE, WiFI won’t connect </p>
<p> Connectivity is a common issue with the Honor 8. A large number of users reported problems related both to Wi-Fi and data networks. The phone won’t connect to a known network for ages or it chooses 3G instead of much faster LTE. </p>
<p> You can try following workarounds for data network issue: </p>
<p> Switch Network type: Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings: Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and reestablish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> The Huawei confirmed that they are aware of the Wi-Fi issue. We can hope that they’ll fix it with the next patch. </p>
<p> Echo while calling </p>
<p> Some users reported a problem with in-call speaker and mic malfunction. According to them, they hear the echo while speaking on the phone. The issue is more present when the loudspeaker is ON. </p>
<p> This is a common issue with many Android-powered phones. Most of the time it is related to pre-installed Google app called TalkBack. Our advice is to turn it off. </p>
<p> No battery percentage was shown </p>
<p> Honor 8 isn’t presenting battery percentage on the home screen by default. Most of the users are accustomed to that feature and they want to enable it but don’t know how. And this is the simplest way: </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon. </p>
<p> In the upper right corner, you’ll see 3 icons. </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon that is in the middle. </p>
<p> Notifications are not displayed when screen is off </p>
<p> Some of the users were left in disbelief when their push notifications from various apps stopped. It can be a quite annoying experience that ruins all-around impression about the phone. Which is pretty great in all manners. </p>
<p> Huawei made a strange decision to improve battery life by completely disabling the notifications while the screen is off. Luckily, that can be changed in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Protected apps. </p>
<p> Add apps that you want to receive notifications from. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this article helpful. Additionally, we are sure that the phone will function much better once it gets updated to Nougat 7.0. The update cycle started on 10th February so be sure to check your phones. </p>
<p> Are you experiencing any other issues? Be sure to tell us and we’ll give our best to help you. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> Just a little point. How do I download video and pictures to my PC. With my other phone a cable connection gave me a file / folder point to select from DCIM to copy or move to the hard drive. These don;t have that option . Is there an option to send the pictures etc.. I don’t have any memory card fitted in the phone as their is no slot. Just a sim card which I don’t want to remove. </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> Thank you for sharing, guys! It looks like installing iOS 11.1.2 on non-X iPhones is indeed a bad idea. </p>

<p> I have a huge problem with battery drainage after upgrading from 11.1.1 to iOS 11.1.2 on my iphone 6s. I lost about 20% only for 3 hours even it was on idle. Has anybody encountered the same issue like me. </p>
<p> Apple shouldn’t have released it before being sure that would not have caused any issues for consumers </p>

<p> iPhone 6 – When using apps my screen rotates on its on and if I try to tilt the phone it won’t go back to normal so I just close the app and reopen. This update has also slowed my phone down a lot. Thinking of going back to Samsung! </p>

<p> After the update i dont know what has happened to the speakers. 1)Whatsapp in app notifications sometimes comes with a weird sound with the default one. 2)When playing a video or while calling, a click like sound comes before they start ! </p>

<p> I’m on an iPhone SE and iOS 11.2.2. I have the music player on my notifications that will go away temporarily if I restart my phone, but eventually comes back. I find my phone is running hotter and the battery life seems to be much shorter. I also seem to be getting all my messenger and messaging alerts twice which makes me want to throw my phone across the room </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> Since Oreo update the phone is absolutely unusable. – Ultra laggy – Apps randomly crash or get killed (who knows) – Voice calls get stopped randomly – Music gets stopped randomly – Keyboard takes 7+ seconds to show up – launching apps from launcher 5+ seconds </p>

<p> Same problem here. My nexus 5x performance after Oreo update was really affected, mainly in terms of fluidity and battery getting drained so fast that I have to charge my phone at least 2 times a day and before a full charge was enough. </p>

<p> I agree with everything you’ve written here. My experience so far is not a good one, and I hope things get fixed quickly. I’ve not been so unhappy since I had to root my Nexus 5 so I could roll back to get rid of Lollipoop. </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> Hi, need some help. I recently fix my old zenfone 5 (the first problem is automatic shutdown) I did a hard reset and factory reset and reformat my phone, this procedure fixes my first problem but then when my phone open and I tried to insert a sim (for cellular data purpose) the 2 sim isn’t available. I tried radio setting (run ping test) didn’t work either, I restart my phone so many times and re-insert my sim like what tutorials said. But the “unavailable” sim problem is still there. What else can I do to fix this error? Thank… Read more » </p>

<p> Alrigt here is my problem to my phone. When I Plugged in my charger, the problem here is that my phone is not charging, but the OTG works very well. I tried to shut down my phone, and then after that, It’s charging but, when the red light of my phone showns in the screen, It turns off and I did the same thing but still the same which means that it’s still not charging. And also I did the factory reset which is the best way to solve some problems but still not charging and the the OTG works… Read more » </p>
<p> Hi, I think the problem is in your charger not your phone. Try to charge your phone on other charger/cable. Or maybe you set your phone on energy saving apps which is whenever your phone reach its lower battery level it automatically shutdown. </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> My iPhone SE freeze in the middle on a conversation, the other person could not hear me anymore, but I could hear him. My friend hang up, I could see the incoming call but was unable to answer him. I’m unable to enlarge pictures. Unable to enter my nip if the phone is flat on the table (when I pick it up it will work fine).

<p> Upgraded? to 11.1.2 on an iPhone 6, and if it’s plugged into power while I’m in the car…even when stopped…I tell Siri to dial a phone number and nothing happens. I turned off as many things as I could in the crappy so-called Do Not Disturb feature, and still no luck. Grrrrrr. </p>
<p> Yes I agree. I never meant to install the iOS 11.1.2 update it was an accident and one I deeply regret. My battery goes down from 75% to 60% in less than a minute causing crazy battery life problems </p>

<p> IPad Pro arbitrarily stops charging. Cable is pulled out and pushed back in, charging resumes. Tried wiggling the cable and connectors thinking the problem was in hardware. After trying three cables and two chargers, I’ve concluded this is in 11.1.2. </p>

<p> Huawei Honor 8 most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei has gained a lot of popularity lately with both Mate (flagship) and Honor (mid-range) series. Honor 8 is the latest addition to the list of mid-budget devices produced by the Chinese company. Upon presentation for the US and EU market, the phone received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, even though Honor 8 offers good performance for an affordable price, there are some common issues worth mentioning. Users reported various problems with both hardware and software. It seems that the producer addressed some of the problems, but there is a large number of those that they need to resolve. Today we listed for you the known issues and possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Video crash while playing </p>
<p> As some of the users stated, the Honor 8 have a lot of issues with the video playback or streaming. It seems that the video crashes and, on some occasion, a restart is the only solution to get things work again. According to them, the crash occurs in online or offline videos, regardless. On the other hand, the fundament of the problem is YouTube. </p>
<p> We have noticed that the problem is widespread and the main culprit is integration with third-party apps. For the standard videos, first and foremost is to check the format. Honor 8 supports these video formats: </p>
<p> WMV </p>
<p> RM </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the online streaming videos are the ones with issues, make sure that you reinstall the given app or try an alternative. It seems that the Honor 8 have a certain level off incompatibility with some of them. Additionally, if the problem is persistent, you should contact customers support and ask for a replace. </p>
<p> Video recording stutter in third-party apps </p>
<p> While this is not as crushing (no pun intended) as the previous issue, it can be as annoying. Namely, many users reported lag and stutter while recording videos on Snapchat or Instagram story. This often leads to unsynchronized audio and video. </p>
<p> This seems to be related to awkward camera overheating. You should check the top of your phone for temperature changes. If the phone’s temperature is normal, try restarting your phone and clearing the app cache and data. Moreover, you can check your battery temperature by typing this code in your dialer *#*#2846579#*#*. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the phone is overheated (and that seems to happen often with some users), you’ll have to let it cool down. The camera behavior is not a strong feature of this model since the following default software is underwhelming. We’ll have to wait and see are there any fixes prepared in the next update build. </p>
<p> 3G works instead LTE, WiFI won’t connect </p>
<p> Connectivity is a common issue with the Honor 8. A large number of users reported problems related both to Wi-Fi and data networks. The phone won’t connect to a known network for ages or it chooses 3G instead of much faster LTE. </p>
<p> You can try following workarounds for data network issue: </p>
<p> Switch Network type: Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings: Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and reestablish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> The Huawei confirmed that they are aware of the Wi-Fi issue. We can hope that they’ll fix it with the next patch. </p>
<p> Echo while calling </p>
<p> Some users reported a problem with in-call speaker and mic malfunction. According to them, they hear the echo while speaking on the phone. The issue is more present when the loudspeaker is ON. </p>
<p> This is a common issue with many Android-powered phones. Most of the time it is related to pre-installed Google app called TalkBack. Our advice is to turn it off. </p>
<p> No battery percentage was shown </p>
<p> Honor 8 isn’t presenting battery percentage on the home screen by default. Most of the users are accustomed to that feature and they want to enable it but don’t know how. And this is the simplest way: </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon. </p>
<p> In the upper right corner, you’ll see 3 icons. </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon that is in the middle. </p>
<p> Notifications are not displayed when screen is off </p>
<p> Some of the users were left in disbelief when their push notifications from various apps stopped. It can be a quite annoying experience that ruins all-around impression about the phone. Which is pretty great in all manners. </p>
<p> Huawei made a strange decision to improve battery life by completely disabling the notifications while the screen is off. Luckily, that can be changed in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Protected apps. </p>
<p> Add apps that you want to receive notifications from. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this article helpful. Additionally, we are sure that the phone will function much better once it gets updated to Nougat 7.0. The update cycle started on 10th February so be sure to check your phones. </p>

<p> When plugged in with headphones (via jack, bluetooth, wifi,.. anything) Honor 8 uses a chimed DING sound for notifications. I just bought an expensive handsfree earpiece and that chime sound almost destroyed my eardrums. (Since Huawei won’t probably do a thing to fix this, I’ll just try to get my money back by returning the headsets…) </p>

<p> By far the most irritating thing about this phone (other than the bloat!!!) is the “smart” unlock. For some reason, you can have it unlocked when paired with one (or more) bluetooth products, but NOT your home WiFi. This seems to go against the battery-conservation efforts of Huawei, but it is just silly for me… maybe if you have a smart watch or something it is fine, but I’m constantly turning off the d*$% lock at home for no reason at all. Additionally, while the word all over the internet is that rooting your phone or installing an alternative firmware… Read more » </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> Yes, slow and laggy, and some functions (i.e. adding words to dictionary) don’t work at all. And while I understand that phones apparently evolve at the speed of light (or rather, at the speed of cornering market share and maximizing profits) calling my 2016 Nexus 5x an “older phone” is completely ridiculous. There’s no way that a phone I’ve owned for about a year should be rendered obsolete with one update. </p>

<p> My Nexus 5X worked great for 2 days after Oreo update but since last few hours it has stopped working completely. It crashed twice and restarted after rescue party. Now except Goggle flashing on the screen, I can’t restart or even shutdown the phone. I am not a techhy so I am confused what to do. </p>

<p> Yes, NPR News app and NPR One app both no longer work with Oreo on the Nexus 5G phone. NPR tech support says “they’re working on it” but it’s been over a month now! Seriously? I had to download a podcast app and am using that now. </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> Hey! I have similar issues to most of the comments I’ve read. I bought mi Zenfone 3 Max 5.2 Inch two months ago and it suddenly started showing connectivity issues. The WiFi stops working even though it says it is still connected,and if I turn WiFi off and on again, it doesn’t connect; it says it has authentication issues and doesn’t connect anymore. Also when using my mobile data, only WhatsApp messaging works since I have unlimited WhatsApp connection, but any function other than messaging in WhatsApp or any other app doesn’t work, as if I had no data, but… Read more » </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> iPhone 8 now after the update big battery drain and the phone constantly autolocks regardless of what it’s set to and will lock while your scrolling or using the phone </p>

<p> Upgraded my iPhone 5s to 11.1.2 and battery draining within 6 hours of little use. Prior to this I could put on charge at bedtime with still 60% plus charge left. Ended up stranded today with a dead phone, resulting in a 7 mile hike. I am so angry. Apple really needs to get its act together and sort this out. This is the first time in years that I am seriously considering changing back to an android phone. iOS 11 has been nothing but problems. Who authorises these releases, when they obviously haven’t been properly tested. For the price… Read more » </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> HOTTTT MESSS I have the Nexus 5X and since I upgraded to the Oreo 8.0 my phone has been randomly rebooting and now I can neither turn it off or on. All I have is a black screen and the words Google flashing. I found out that the upgrade never uploaded properly and that it is in an infinity loop? I was told to put it in Safe Mode but as soon as I did that and went to charge the phone it reboot itself out of safe mode…..My phone was getting hot possibly from Overheating I finally after 30… Read more » </p>

<p> My Nexus 5X is not slower but since it was updated to Oreo 5 days ago it is practically unusable – it restarts on it’s own every few minutes (sometimes every 5 minutes, sometimes after 1.5 hours, one never knows), the keyboard keeps disappearing while I type (extremely annoying!), the battery drains super fast (with the screen off and no use – from 100% to 5% in 4 hours!) and the top third of the machine really heats up. </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>

<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds.

<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>

<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>

<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue.

<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>

<p> I have a ZE530KL which is stuck in a booting reset loop. I guessed it was power switch stuck on. Took to Asus service in Taiwan as it is under warranty. They refused to fix it. Said there was moisture inside which caused corrosion. The phone has never been in water. What should I do? </p>

<p> I have been experiencing the same issue with my wifi. I have the same model Zenfone as you. I was wondering if you found out how to fix the connectivity problem. </p>

<p> Go to settings->About->Software Information->Tap build number 6 times quickly to enable “Developer Options”. </p>
<p> Now,Open settings->Open “Developer Options” go to “Hardware accelerated rendering” and select “Disable HW overlays”. </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> My Oreo on Nexus 5X is working awesome. That’s after few changes 1. Make developer option enabled 2. On dev options go to — window animation scale and change to .5x — transition animation scale and change to .5x — animator duration scale and change to .5x 3. If you want, change the OpenGL to Skia (not really needed, but you can if you want) 4. Restart the device in recovery mode and clear cache…. </p>

<p> thank you I knew that Oreo cause that problem this is great. </p>
<p> I also update my Nexus 5X with Android Oreo, and I also have a big problem with battery drain issue. My phone is getting hot and only show 5 hours to go after fully charged. A factory reset didn’t help me. In the setting menu, I can’t find any app who need much energy. </p>

<p> I just updated my Nexus 5x to Oreo and am having the same problem. It’s a noticeable decrease in performance. Switching back from OpenGPL did not help much for me, so I guess it’s time to roll back. </p>
<p> Wipe the Partition Cache as suggested by JustChippinIn. Worked wonders for me. </p>

<p> Clearing cache in recovery mode has continued to work well for me anytime an update slows my N5x down and did so after getting the push notification for Oreo update. YMMV </p>
<p> The Skia change did nothing, but this worked purrrfectly! Thank you!!!! Now I just need to remember it for next time. </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> having problem with mobile data.. after the last update, 1. cant receive any message on Messenger app 2. Facebook up not responding 3. Youtube keeps on loading 4. Chrome keeps on saying “reload page, check internet connection” 5. Mail app keep on loading.. however, playing online games using data is working so i believe that internet is not the issue .. Connecting to wifi is not an issue as well, uaing wifi connection, every apps mentioned earlier seems to work fine.. what should i do?? </p>
<p> Hello, Gab! Try resetting network settings or removing/inserting SIM card. Also, you should look for connection settings in the respective apps you’ve mentioned. Namely, some of the apps have restrictions on Mobile Data usage. Maybe the update made some uncalled changes. </p>

<p> Hi, after the updates, i am having problem with charging my zenfone max 3. before the battery will be fully charge within 2-3hrs, now, it took 7-8 hrs before it will be fully charge. And when I plug in the charger, you need to adjust the wire or charge socket of the phone before it will charge. My zenfone is 6 months old only </p>
<p> same issue here before it only took 2-3 hrs for a full charge now it indicates 7-8 hrs. idk if this has something to do with the cord or adaptor. phone is only 5 months zenfone 3 max. A little help would be appreciated here. thanks. </p>
<p> I’ve encountered the same issue before what I did is I changed the cord, btw my zenfone 3 max is 4 month old. Hope this help </p>
<p> Have you tried the alternative cord? It’s quite hard for cord or adaptor to get faulty. Most of the time, the problem is with the phone, or to be more exact – battery. Was there any update that possibly triggered this battery issue? </p>
<p> Since your device is not even remotely old enough for you to have battery issues, it’s certainly an update/software issue. Have you tried to wipe cache partition or to restore factory settings? </p>

<p> Hi I’m using Zenfone 3 max 5.5 and everything was working fine until yesterday. I’m not able to connect to my mobile data, when I turn it on. nothing happens, I mean no indication that I’m connected or not even showing 3G/4G. tried reset factory and tried using safe mode. Still not working, is there any troubleshooting steps that I can do before going to the service center? </p>
<p> Hi, Chris. It’s hard to tell. Most of the times these issues appear due to a software bug. And since you’ve had performed a reset, it’s safe to tell that the problem is not software related. So, service center it is. </p>

<p> I am also experiencing the same problem with my asus zenfone max 5.5. Prior to android nougat update, when you touch the screen, it automatically focuses on the object where you touched the screen. For near objects, it will produce a macro shot-like photo (which I loved). I have observed that in the settings, the focus mode set as smart-AF disappeared after the update </p>

<p> Today i was listening to music with my headphones (not the included ones) everything was fine…pulled them out…when i put them in a few hours later, my zenfone 3 didn’t notice i was putting in headphones and played the music on the speakers…. </p>
<p> Try plugging your headphones few times in and out. That’s a common bug and it’s easily resolvable by plug in/out procedure and a reset. If the problem is persistent, there are the alternative ways to address it. </p>

<p> After an update, my zm3’s main camera became unresponsive? How can I fix it? Please help 🙁 </p>
<p> Since last update I can’t unblock the phone. Says that pattern is not correct, I know it is correct, but the phone doesn’t recognise it. Also didn’t ask if I forgot my pattern. I don’t want to hard reset phone without considering other options. </p>
<p> Is there a chance you have a SIM card PIN? Have you tried some of the previous patterns you had used? That is a major problem, and it’s quite hard to resolve it without the complete wipe out of your phone. </p>

<p> My Nexus 5x is also super laggy and utterly a piece of garbage after just 18 months with oreo update. My iPhone 5s bought in 2013 almost more than 5 years old with iOS 11 is working like a dream no lags no issues made my iPhone a bit better actually. Although I know nexus has only 2gb ram so it might struggle handling a much resource oriented oreo but my iPhone has even lower 1gb ram so how can Apple do a fantastic job with iPhone that Google can’t with nexus as of now. </p>

<p> The render change (OpenGL Skia) does not fix the lagging issues Im seeing with the Nexus 5x. It also resets every reboot. The phone is horribly laggy and slow even after a cache wipe even in safe mode. </p>

<p> 5x sometimes get stuck in permanent bootloop after an update. Happened to me 6 months ago. I talked to google and none of the troubleshooting worked. They told me it was a known issue and sent me a new 5x even though I was out of warranty. </p>
<p> Omg I’m so glad I found this thread. My phone is super slow and laggy after the Oreo update. Has been about a month or so now since I updated it. It’s TERRIBLE!!! Forget trying to snapchat, hardly works anymore. Keyboards take forever to pop up, apps take way too long to open. HELP!!!!! </p>

In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> My zenfone 3 has hang up problem and ghost touch. What would I do? </p>
<p> We hope that you’re covered with warranty since your best bet is to turn to some repair service. ”Ghost touch” is a well-known issue and it’s, sadly, hardware-related. </p>
<p> I just bought it last Monday. Will they give a new phone or have some repair on it? </p>
<p> Always ask for a brand new device, if possible. Repairs can be lengthy. And they are in debt to provide you with the functional device. </p>

<p> Hi, I’m having problems on my Zenfone 3 max. After I updated it to 190 firmware my battery drains faster now and the fingerprint scanner is not working anymore. What to do? Thanks! </p>
<p> If the update affected the hardware in such a way, the best solution is to restore factory settings. </p>

<p> Hi, im having problem with my asus z3 speaker. It produce bad quality sound and more like a crackling sound when i turn music or video. But when i test it on single test speaker it was fine. And when i turn my phone to safe mode it was also fine. What went wrong? Was it because one of the application that i downloaded or was it because of something else? Thx </p>

<p> It’s hard to say, honestly. Some signs are leading towards the software bug that shows unprecise battery percentage. Others, well, are showing that your battery is malfunctioning. How old is your device? </p>

<p> Recently, my phone back button, home and recent key are not working like as usual. When I tap on it, the screen not respond, and when I tried to turning the “show touch” function on, it like I am touching the bottom of the screen, not the button. I already reset my phone with factory settings but nothing changed. Is this hardware problem? I’m planning to send it to customer services tomorrow because I just bought it for two months. My phone is ASUS ZenFone 3 max 5.5 (ZC553KL) using Android 6.0 Marshmallow. </p>
<p> That must be the hardware, Jun. That’s a good idea. </p>

<p> When the last update happen my screen flickers often, it’s like my screen is goes up and down. How can I fix this ? do I need to factory reset my device ? </p>
<p> It’s probably your best shot to resolve that issue. It’s most certainly code error that can be solved only by resetting to factory settings. </p>

<p> In your case, the best solution is product replacement but if you have your phone more than the prescribed period for the replacement the only way is to factory reset. I have no other choice. 🙁 </p>

<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> Recently, my phone back button, home and recent key are not working like as usual. When I tap on it, the screen not respond, and when I tried to turning the “show touch” function on, it like I am touching the bottom of the screen, not the button. I already reset my phone with factory settings but nothing changed. Is this hardware problem? I’m planning to send it to customer services tomorrow because I just bought it for three months. My phone is ASUS ZenFone 3 max 5.5 (ZC553KL) using Android 6.0 Marshmallow. </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>

<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Poco X2 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> After 2 years, Xiaomi’s subsidiary, Poco, introduced the successor to groundbreaking Pocophone F1. Now, we can’t say with certainty whether this is a direct successor, since the Poco X2, seemingly, focuses on the screen refresh rate more than super-affordable hardware. But it’s far from being a one-trick pony. Today, we invested some time in learning about the Poco X2 and brought you the list of common issues. </p>
<p> If you have experienced any issues on the Poco X2, make sure to check our list because we have some recommended solutions, as well. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Missing Refresh rate and NFC options </p>
<p> The Poco X2 and the Redmi K30 (4G version) are literally the same devices. The only two differences are print on the back and MIUI ROMs, as the Redmi K30 uses China ROM and the Poco X2 comes with the Poco version of the Global MIUI 11. That’s it. </p>
<p> That is possibly the reason why some Poco X2 users are unable to locate NFC and Screen Refresh rate settings. To utilize Google’s services, you’ll need to flash the Global ROM on your device. We recommend unlocking the bootloader and flashing the Global ROM or, you might choose, Xiaomi EU ROM which is toned-down MIUI without ads. </p>
<p> 2. Google Play in-app purchases don’t work </p>
<p> Another problem related to the ROM you are running. Google Play purchases probably won’t work on Chinese ROM so make sure to run the official Global ROM before trying to purchase anything from the Store. </p>
<p> If you are certain that your ROM is Global and your device is not rooted, make sure to clear cache and data from the Play Store, check your credentials or, eventually, reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 3. How to download and install Gcam on Poco X2 </p>
<p> The camera setup on the Poco X2 is quite amazing, considering the pricing of the device. The good thing about being the twin brother of the Redmi K30 lies in the bigger support from independent developers. So, any Gcam port that works on the Redmi K30, should work on the Poco X2. And vice versa. As they are basically the same device. </p>
<p> But should you get the Gcam and use it over the stock Camera app? Based on reports: definitely. The white balance and overall color science are not strong sides of Xiaomi (and its subsidiaries, Poco and Redmi). That’s all avoided with the Gcam which brings better image processing and more realistic photography. </p>
<p> If you are not sure how to install Gcam on your Poco X2, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> In Google Chrome on your handset, navigate to the Gcam Hub, here, and download one of the versions by tapping on it. </p>
<p> Allow installation of apps from third-party sources when prompted. </p>
<p> You can download the configuration files and add them by following the instructions provided, here. The configuration for this device can be found within the Redmi K30, on this list. </p>
<p> Install Gcam and that’s it. You can tweak some options in Settings to your liking. Enjoy. </p>
<p> 4. Battery drain issue </p>
<p> The 120Hz refresh rate and the 6.6 inches LCD display are massive reasons why this device takes a lot of juice. However, that’s covered with the large 4500 mAh battery that supports the 27W fast charging. On the other hand, it doesn’t come as a surprise that some users noticed a significant battery drain. This Poco X2 issue is especially prominent after updates. </p>
<p> Now, there are a few things you can do to reduce the battery drain, and we made sure to list them below: </p>
<p> Disable Automatic brightness and set the brightness manually. </p>
<p> Open Developer options and disable Mobile Data always on. </p>
<p> Prevent some secondary apps from working in the background. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth overnight. </p>
<p> Use Greenify or any other third-party application to limit the background processes. </p>
<p> Update your device or reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 5. Missing notifications </p>
<p> The notifications as a whole were and still are one of the biggest Xiaomi’s omissions on MIUI. The system kills off the apps in the background on its own, notifications disappear from the status bar, vibration doesn’t work with the incoming calls, etc. So many problems and we are not sure why Xiaomi keeps adding new features and completely neglects the essentials. </p>
<p> On the Poco X2 running MIUI 11 (based on Android 10), Xiaomi fixed some of those issues. However, the problem with calls still stands, as the users are not hearing the ringing sound but there’s no prompt of an incoming call on the lock screen. </p>
<p> There are some things you should check to ensure that the issue is not on your side. Here’s what you should do: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Display > Notch & status bar. Toggle ON the “Show icons for incoming notifications” option. </p>
<p> Open Settings > Sound & vibration. Select any default Ringtone. Stick with the system sounds. </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Dialer and clear cache and data. While there, open Notifications and ensure that all notifications are enabled. If you are using a 3rd-party dialer (Google’s Phone or something else), make sure to set do the same. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings > Apps > Manage apps. Tap the 3-dot menu and select Default apps. Once there, select your default Dial app. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6. The Dialer app and keyboard are hanging </p>
<p> Other Poco X2 users reported issues with two stock apps, the Dialer app and the keyboard. Both are, based on reports, hanging and glitching. Those two apps also tend to crash from time to time, although that’s not as common. </p>
<p> The problem is probably related to the latest MIUI release and updating the firmware should address it. On the other hand, you can tackle problems within the app (system or 3rd-party apps) by clearing cache and data. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to troubleshoot issues with Dialer and Keyboard on the Poco X2: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and open Dialer. Clear cache and data from it. Do the same for the Keyboard app. </p>
<p> Get back to Manage apps and tap on the 3-dot menu. Tap Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Switch to a third-party dialer and keyboard until the problem is fixed with updates. </p>
<p> 7. Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Wi-Fi issues are not exactly common but an occasional bug that comes with an update might ruin the user experience. For some users, there’s no internet connection even though they are connected to a network. </p>
<p> Now, in many cases, this might be an MIUI bug, but it’s worth checking everything on your side before casting blame on the performance of the device or the performance of its ROM. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to troubleshoot Wi-Fi issues on the Poco X2: </p>
<p> Reboot your device and router/modem. </p>
<p> Delete the SSID from the list of networks and connect again. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 8. Mobile data not working during calls </p>
<p> This highly depends on your carrier and service provider. Namely, maybe the service is not available on some carriers or there is a problem with the APN configuration. You can tackle the latter by resetting APN settings and making sure that GSM/WCDMA/LTE is your preferred network type. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and NFC. </p>
<p> Reset APN. </p>
<p> If the issue persists, make sure to contact your carrier or service provider and ask for help. </p>
<p> 9. Poor cell reception </p>
<p> On a similar note, some users have a hard time with the cell reception, claiming that the signal is really bad even in the highly-populated areas where it shouldn’t be as half as bad. Not only does this make the call quality much worse, but it also depletes the battery faster. Which isn’t great, considering how much battery drops when the 120Hz refresh rate is enabled. </p>
<p> On the other hand, this device is built for one market so make sure to check the supported bands before acquiring it. </p>
<p> Now, in regards to bad network coverage, we can recommend taking these steps: </p>
<p> Ensure that your SIM card is properly placed. If possible, stick to one SIM card for the time being. </p>
<p> Remove the protective casing. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth and NFC when you are not using them. </p>
<p> Reset APN. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 10. Face unlock not working </p>
<p> All Xiaomi-made devices running MIUI 10 and later, including Redmi and Poco series, have face unlock. Some ROMs will limit them to certain regions but, by switching the region in Settings > Additional settings, you should be able to utilize it. </p>
<p> Now, Face Unlock should work on the Poco X2 from the get-go but, being a novel device, the lack of optimization or a temporary bug might prevent this. </p>
<p> If you are unable to utilize face unlock on the Poco X2, check these steps: </p>
<p> Open Additional settings. Select Region and choose Hong Kong. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Passwords & security > Face unlock. Enter your PIN or password. Tap Delete face data and enroll your face again. Make sure that the Unlock using face data is toggled on. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 11. Screen flickers after unlocking and UI animations lag </p>
<p> To be perfectly honest, the majority of issues we listed here and issues in general, stem from the lack of ROM optimization. Although the Poco X2 comes with the 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touchscreen response, some tweaking is necessary to avoid those minor but visible initial omissions. </p>
<p> Some users have experienced a screen flicker when the device is unlocked, during that short transition from the lock screen (or idle state) to Home Screen. Others have that small but noticeable lag when scrolling, switching between apps, etc. We can agree that this doesn’t go well with the aforementioned enhancements this device has. </p>
<p> Now, we are sure Poco will deal with these issues eventually through updates. But, for the time being, check these steps to reduce flickers and lags on your Poco X2: </p>
<p> Lower animations in Developer options. </p>
<p> Disable live wallpapers on Home and Lock screens. </p>
<p> Stick to the stock launcher. </p>
<p> 12. Common troubleshooting steps for Xiaomi Poco X2 </p>
<p> Tap All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number. </p>
<p> Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options. </p>
<p> Boot the device into Safe Mode </p>
<p> Turn the device off. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and then, once the Xiaomi logo appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down button. </p>
<p> To exit Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>

<p> Motorola Moto G7 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Motorola is the champion of the mid-range segment in more than a few countries, especially the USA. And for a good reason. This year, Motorola presented 4 different devices with slightly different quirks and for different price segments. The main device is the Moto G7, followed by the battery-oriented Moto G7 Power, the Moto G7 Play, and the Moto G7 Plus. </p>
<p> Now, these devices are usually sturdy and have a good build, reliable cameras, good battery life, and close-to-stock Android experience. That’s why are they often recommended by various industry professionals. However, they are not without issues. </p>
<p> To help affected Moto G7 users, we decided to collect all major (and minor, too) common issues and present them below. With some applicable solutions, of course. </p>
<p> The majority of these issues and their respective solutions might be present other devices in the G7 lineup, including Moto G7 Plus, Moto G7 Power, or Moto G7 Play. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Night mode keeps changing </p>
<p> The Night mode on Android 9-powered the Moto G7 is a bit limited as it is based on stock Android. It’s not global (for that we need to wait for the Android 10 update), but it does change the appearance in the notification shade. </p>
<p> Some users reported that the Night mode keeps changing on its own. Both ways. From Light to Dark theme and vice versa. If you have that problem, you can force one or another in Developer options. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do it with ease: </p>
<p> Open Developer options from Settings. (explained at the bottom how to enable it). </p>
<p> Navigate to Dark Mode. </p>
<p> Select Always on. </p>
<p> 2. Slow Wi-Fi </p>
<p> Users are not satisfied with the lack of 5 GHz-band support but that’s even a lesser problem. It seems that Wireless is slow for some while there are numerous threads about Access Point issues (especially on the Moto G7 Power). </p>
<p> Here are some things you can do to address Wi-Fi issues: </p>
<p> Boot into safe mode and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth and Mobile Data. </p>
<p> 3. System UI not responding </p>
<p> Certain System UI errors lead to crashes and even system failure and reboot. Some users experienced crashes while on the Home screen, while others had issues in the Settings menu. To make things worse, Motorola Update Services crashed for some during the firmware update. </p>
<p> Here are some ways to fix these rather serious issues on the Moto G7: </p>
<p> Reboot the device. </p>
<p> Limit the number of apps working in the background. You can do so in the Developer options, under the Background process limit. </p>
<p> Lower the Animations in Developer options. </p>
<p> Boot into Safe Mode and, if the device performs better, uninstall recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Reset your Moto G7 to factory settings. </p>
<p> 4. Low in-call and Bluetooth volume </p>
<p> One of the most important things about a cellphone (smart or classic) is calling and receiving calls. And that’s what’s been the problem for more than a few Moto G7 users who experienced muffled and low sound while talking on the phone. This seems to be a long-time issue on these devices and we don’t have any adequate recommendations or fix. </p>
<p> To add injury to insult, the Bluetooth audio output is not all that great as well, being too low even on the maximum setting. For this, there might be a solution and it’s hidden in Developer options. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open Developer options (explained how to enable Developer options at the bottom). </p>
<p> Navigate to Absolute Bluetooth volume. </p>
<p> Disable this option and reboot your device. </p>
<p> 5. Battery drains fast </p>
<p> The Moto G7 is on the lower side when it comes to battery. 3000 mAh is, by all means, not bad. But the 6.2-inch LCD screen is a big enough consumer to deplete it fast. Allegedly, the moderate (tolerable) Screen-on Time went down for some users, as the battery started draining faster than usual. </p>
<p> There are many reasons why that’s the case, so here are some tips to improve battery life on your Moto G7: </p>
<p> Disable background apps. You can use a third-party app to do so. </p>
<p> Make sure your signal is stable. We encourage all our readers to check available bands before purchasing devices. Bad network coverage leads to constant signal-hunting which leads to battery depletion. </p>
<p> Disable Auto-brightness and set preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Disable Location services and Bluetooth when you are not actively using them. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6. Random reboots </p>
<p> Random reboots are never a good sign. These can be caused by various hardware issues, but the system might be the culprit as well. If you are constantly bothered by random reboots on the Moto G7, we suggest resetting the handset to factory settings. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t help, make sure to take your device to responsible service and ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> 7. Can’t move photos and save media to SD card </p>
<p> This is a major Moto G7 issue, based on community reports. Users seemingly can’t move photos and supported apps to the SD card or save media from streaming services. For some, the SD card is accessible but it disappears after they reboot the device. </p>
<p> To fix the SD card issues, the only way is to format it with your device. What you need to do is back up all your data to your PC or internal storage. Once you’ve done that, format the SD card and add it as external storage, not an extension to the internal one. The latter causes issues and leads to SD card corruptions. </p>
<p> 8. The phone can’t connect to car media </p>
<p> Bluetooth connectivity is essential for folks that play their music via the car media (or use navigation) while driving. </p>
<p> That’s why the failing Bluetooth pairing issue on the Moto G7 might be a dealbreaker for some. One recommended solution if you can’t seem to find the car media is to enable the “Show Bluetooth devices without names” in Developer options. </p>
<p> We wrote an article a while ago about phone-to-car media connectivity issues. Check it out here to fix the problem. Just make sure to try it out on other Bluetooth devices. If the issue persists and the Bluetooth won’t work at all, take your device for a repair or replace it. </p>
<p> 9. How to install Gcam on the Moto G7 </p>
<p> This modern smartphone race brought a lot of good for the end-user, as we all got formidable camera setups on mid-range or even low-end devices. However, software optimization is still behind and we can say that many are quite far behind Google (and Huawei, to some extent), when it comes to processing. </p>
<p> The best thing is that there are ports of Google Camera for many devices. This includes the Moto G7. If you were wondering how to install Gcam on the Moto G7, here are the exact steps: </p>
<p> In Google Chrome on your handset, navigate to the Gcam Hub, here, and download one of the versions by tapping on it. The HDR Plus one works great on the Moto G7. Alternatively, try this one. </p>
<p> Allow installation of apps from third-party sources when prompted. </p>
<p> Install Gcam and that’s it. You can tweak some options in Settings to your liking. Enjoy. </p>
<p> 10. Screen colors not calibrated </p>
<p> The issue with colors being off was earlier addressed by tweaking certain Display settings. However, that option is (for no apparent reason), missing from the Moto G7. So, that’s a dead-end. If you are having either extremely cold (blueish) or warm (reddish) color representation, there’s nothing you can do without rooting your device. </p>
<p> You can just confirm that the Night Light is disabled, but don’t hold your hopes high as it depends on the LCD panels Motorola decided to place on their mid-range devices. </p>
<p> 11. GPS and Mobile Data not working </p>
<p> When it comes to reports about Moto G7 issues, we run into a couple of them concerning bad GPS services. For some, there are no satellites available (which is strange), while others have issues with location precision that abysmal on their devices. </p>
<p> Here are some steps you can try to fix this: </p>
<p> Enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning in Location settings. Open Settings > Security & Location > Location > Advanced. </p>
<p> Also, enable the Improve Location accuracy. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Moving on, mobile data is also an issue for some users. This can be rather isolated as it concerns certain carriers, but if your mobile data is slow or your Moto G7 won’t connect, try these troubleshooting steps to fix it: </p>
<p> Enable the Airplane mode and disable it after a minute or so. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Check whether the SIM card is properly set in the compartment. </p>
<p> Reset SIM card settings. </p>
<p> 12. No in-call and media sounds </p>
<p> There’s hardly anything worse than for the device speaker not working at all. Both Moto G7 speakers are not working (down-firing speaker and call speaker) for some users. There are some things you can try and, if they fail, make sure to ask for the replacement since we are probably looking at the hardware issue. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to troubleshoot sound issues on the Moto G7: </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Run diagnostics in the Device Help app. Open Diagnosis > Hardware Test > Receiver and run the test. If it fails, move to the next step. </p>
<p> Try with the Factory reset. </p>
<p> Ask for the replacement, the speaker is probably down. </p>
<p> 13. Ghost touch </p>
<p> Ghost touch is, among some other entries from the list, far from a small bug. Some users reported that the problem with the display prevents them from accessing Settings which is a big issue. </p>
<p> If you have issues with the ghost touch on the Moto G7, try these steps to fix it: </p>
<p> Remove the screen protector. </p>
<p> Clean your screen with a wet cloth and then dry it with the dry one. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 14. Can’t connect to a PC </p>
<p> In case you are not able to connect your Moto G7 to a PC, the problem is probably in drivers. We recommend installing proper drivers and enabling File Transfer when prompted. </p>
<p> If the issue persists and you are unable to connect to a PC, try rebooting the device or switch to an alternative USB port. </p>
<p> 15. Freezing issues </p>
<p> Users also reported freezing and slowdowns on Moto G7, especially when coming out of the sleep idle mode. This is a major issue and some weren’t able to address it even after the factory reset. </p>
<p> If the factory reset won’t help, there’s barely anything else that you can do. </p>
<p> 16. Can’t update or download apps from the Play Store </p>
<p> One user had issues with updating and downloading apps on their Moto G7. The problem lies in the outdated Play Store that, for some reason, won’t update. If you have similar issues, just force update with the latest APK of Google Play Services. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > All apps. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose to show all apps (system apps as well). </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from the Play Store and Google Play Services and reboot your device. </p>
<p> If the issue persists, navigate to any APK aggregate website, like APK Mirror, here. </p>
<p> Download the latest version of Google Play Services. </p>
<p> Run the APK and allow installation from third-party sources. </p>
<p> Install the APK and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Try accessing the Play Store again. </p>
<p> 17. Headphone jack not working </p>
<p> Another problem that some users have with Moto G7 is the inconsistent headphone jack. It seems that it suddenly stops working for some and the audio output goes directly to the main speaker. </p>
<p> If you’ve tried it with different headphones and the problem persists, contact your retailer. The problem is in the hardware. </p>
<p> 18. Netflix and other streaming apps not working </p>
<p> Multiple users reported issues with Netflix and similar streaming services that just won’t work on the wireless network for some reason. It seems that apps load without any issues while on Mobile Data. </p>
<p> If you are stuck with this issue as well, try fixing it with the steps below: </p>
<p> Uninstall Netflix and try installing Netflix APK from here. </p>
<p> Reboot your router and device. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 19. The phone won’t turn on </p>
<p> The worst problem of them all. In case your Moto G7 won’t boot at all (no signs of life), we can recommend nothing but taking it directly for a repair. Obviously, the hardware is failing. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if it just won’t boot the system, you can try and start the device in the Safe Mode from the Recovery menu. The explanation is at the bottom of the article. </p>
<p> 20. The phone vibrating or ringing for no reason </p>
<p> In regards to vibration, this is a feature, believe it or not. It can be disabled with ease and you can do it by navigating to Settings > Apps > Moto > Features > Moto Actions > Flip for Do Not Disturb. Once there, disable Flip for Do Not Disturb. </p>
<p> Ringing for no reason, on the other hand, is usually caused by a rogue app that took a ringtone (longer than the notification ones) as a default notification tone. Check all apps that might have changeable tones to disable it. </p>
<p> 21. Stock camera won’t save location </p>
<p> This is closely related to the GPS issues entry we already covered. It seems that GPS reading and the overall precision of location services on this device are often sub-par. </p>
<p> What you can do is troubleshoot GPS and just disable and re-enable the Save location option in the camera. Also, make sure that the Camera has permission to access Location. Rebooting your device might help, as well. </p>
<p> 22. The phone randomly disconnects while charging </p>
<p> This is probably a factory defect causing the problem so we recommend replacing the cable or replacing the device itself. Of course, this stands if you can confirm that your cable is original 15W Turbo Charger. </p>
<p> Alternatively, before contacting your retailer, we highly suggest resetting your device to factory settings. Although the software bug can rarely cause issues like this. </p>
<p> 23. Mic sound is muffled and low volume in calls </p>
<p> We already covered the problem with the complete absence of sound, but there’s a slightly less serious problem with the in-call sound. Some users stated on the official support forum that the sound during calls is muffled so the other side can barely hear them. </p>
<p> First, make sure that the mic is clean and remove debris and dust. After that, try restarting your device and look for improvements. You should also try and remove the protective case and screen protector, as they might be covering one or both mics on the G7. </p>
<p> 24. Important troubleshooting steps for the Moto G7 </p>
<p> Enter Developer Options </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select System. </p>
<p> Open About phone. </p>
<p> Tap on Build number 7 times. You should get the message informing you that you are now a developer. </p>
<p> Get back to the main menu of Settings and, at the bottom, you should see Developer options, </p>
<p> Boot into Safe Mode </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button to bring out the Power menu. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Power off icon until you are prompted to enter Safe mode. </p>
<p> Tap OK. </p>
<p> To get out of Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Network settings reset. </p>
<p> Choose to reset your Network settings. </p>
<p> Confirm when prompted. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> First, navigate to Settings > System > Backup and back up all your settings and app data. Besides that, make sure to connect your device to a PC and back up all your media. You can also use Google Photos to backup all your photos from the device. You’ll need your Google Account password later. </p>
<p> Once you are certain that everything can be safely deleted, in Settings > System > Advanced, choose Reset options. </p>
<p> Select Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Confirm the selection. Your device will reboot and after some time, you’ll start from scratch. </p>
<p> With that, we can conclude this lengthy article about Moto G7 issues. Thank you for reading and, in case you have additional issues to report, please do so in the comments section below. We or other readers might help you resolve the issue at hand. </p>
<p> Moto G7 talkback turned on accidentally and can’t scroll screen or get to settings </p>
<p> You have to use 2 fingers to scroll. Also to select anything first tap app or button to select then tap again to activate. You can turn this feature off in settings: accessibility: talk back Hope this helps, drive me mad when it first happened to me didn’t know wtf was going on! </p>

<p> My husband and I both have Moto g 7 play and we both had the issue where we could not receive photos, yet we used to on these phones. My hubby’s phone often goes into a mode where it speaks every command he is trying to do. We called our provider about the first issue and the fix they recommended didn’t work. He did a complete factory reset and it fixed the photo issue but not the other one. Anyone else experience this? </p>

<p> I’ve had so much trouble with this G7 I wouldn’t go back to factory settings. I mean 15 + problems one or two at a time. Motorola’s questionnaire on how you like the phone has 20 problems and I had 15.. Rxample; audio for blind individuals would not shut off. The only solution;was in settings. Could not manually get need to shut off. SETTINGS WOULD NOT SCROLL. EVERY PROBLEM ,EVERYONE HAS HAD, MOTO G7, I’VE HAD TWICE. ???. Do your research b4 purchase.. customer with no hair left.. frustration pulled-out. ? </p>

<p> iOS 13.5.1 issues: Battery drain, Bluetooth problems, and more </p>
<p> Apple recently released the latest iOS 13.5.1 update. The update is available to users of all compatible iPhone Models. Unlike the previous update, this one doesn’t bring any new features but instead focuses on improving the overall security of the OS. </p>
<p> Although Apple’s update release notes aren’t very clear on what exactly the new update does, it does state that the update addresses the vulnerability exploited by the uncover jailbreak. With that being said, most jailbreakers would want to avoid this update. The rest of the users can comfortably install this release, and they won’t notice any difference in the way their iPhone works. </p>
<p> Or will they? </p>
<p> Although the new update brings zero new features, it actually causes some problems to users who installed it. Users are reporting battery drains, Bluetooth issues, connectivity problems, and more. </p>
<p> However, none of the problems seems to be widespread, as these are the individually reported cases. You have better chances of installing the update without any problems, than being stuck with an annoying issue. Nevertheless, I’m going to list some of the reported problems here, so you can see what could potentially go wrong. </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 battery drain </p>
<p> Reports about the battery drain caused by iOS 13.5.1 have been circulating on Twitter since the update’s release. Here’s one of the complaints: </p>
<p> @AppleSupport iphone battery draining like crazy after upgrading to iOS 13.5.1. What’s going on? Is there a fix?? </p>
<p> Right now, the solution to this problem is unknown. It appears that users experiencing the battery drain issue will have to wait for Apple to release a follow-up update. </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> Although reported by the smaller number of users, it appears that Bluetooth also doesn’t work for some people who installed iOS 13.5.1. </p>
<p> @Apple my phones Bluetooth just won’t connect to any device even though it’s turned on and discoverable? Any ideas </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 Face ID issues </p>
<p> Although iOS 13.5 improved Face ID to make it work with face masks, some people apparently have problems with it stretching to iOS 13.5.1. </p>
<p> @AppleSupport Why my face id isn’t working? I just updated to ios 13.5.1 and now it’s keep telling me that face id is not available! Can you help me? </p>
<p> Other problems </p>
<p> Besides the above-mentioned issues that appear to be more common, there are also a few more problems, including a camera problem, weird charging (though this one wasn’t specified, so I can’t tell you whether it was indeed caused by iOS 13.5.1, and a SIM card issue where the phone shows SIM cards as invalid. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, there are no confirmed solutions to any of these problems. Apple support usually recommends generic solutions to particular problems, by I doubt any of those will be helpful. Users that were hit by the update will probably have to wait for a patch. </p>
<p> Have you experienced any issues after installing iOS 13.5.1? If so, feel free to share them with us in the comments below. </p>

<p> Mine did the same. I plugged it in to itunes to make a backup, in case it all went to pot, and just that synch seemed to fix it. Have no earthly idea why! Still have huge battery drain, but at least it’s a phone again.. </p>

<p> I could not even install the update on iphone XR and the phone locked up during the install and cannot even be restored. Apple Care has no solutions and they are not offering to replace my phone. All data, photos and history lost. </p>

<p> I have updated my iPhone 7 Plus to iOS 13.5.1 and immediately after updating I faced rapid battery drain and abnormal charging. I haven’t tried the Bluetooth yet. Hope apple comes up with a follow up update soon to rectify these issues. Instead of Adding something productive they have come up with more problems. Highly disappointed. </p>

<p> I have the same issue, it goes from 90% to 1% in minutes. But if I reboot the phone it goes back up to 90% again. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 common problems and how to fix them </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 is an exceptional budget device. It packs a solid set of specs and build quality, which makes it quite appealing to buyers in its price range. </p>
<p> A friend of mine recently got this device, and he’s very content with it. It easily gets him through the day with the 4000 mAh battery, and it’s also a smooth ride, thanks to 6GB of RAM and the Snapdragon 660. </p>
<p> However, just like any other phone (including much pricier models), the Redmi Note 7 has its own minor issues. Most of them happen in individual cases, but they’re still issues. So, if you recently encountered a problem with your brand new Redmi Note 7, I hope you’ll find a solution in this article. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching it, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1: Touch too sensitive </p>
<p> The first thing you’ll probably notice when using the Note 7 for the first time is that its display is probably more sensitive than what you’re used to. This is not a bug per se, it’s just how the display was made. </p>
<p> So, there’s really nothing you can do about it, because there’s no way to adjust the sensitivity with software. You can actually try a different screen protector, but I’m not sure how much it will help. </p>
<p> 2: GPS problem </p>
<p> Reportedly, GPS malfunction is a widespread problem on the Note 7. Apps like Google Maps or Waze fail to establish a connection with the GPS service, which basically renders them unusable. </p>
<p> Luckily, you’re not powerless when it comes to solving this problem. The first solution I have in mind is simply keeping your MIUI version up to date. Xiaomi will eventually release a fix (if it already hasn’t), and the problems should vanish. </p>
<p> But if the problem persists, even with the latest MIUI version installed on your phone, there’s an additional step I found on the MIUI forum you could try. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Dual Apps. </p>
<p> Turn on Google services. </p>
<p> Toggle on the apps you have problems with (Uber, Waze, etc.) </p>
<p> Tap the Battery icon. </p>
<p> Tap Go to Settings under App Battery Saver. </p>
<p> Click Google Maps/Waze/etc. </p>
<p> The ‘dual version’ of the select app will appear on your Home Screen. Use this version until Xiaomi fixes the GPS problem with an update. </p>
<p> Keep in mind this method only works with third-party apps like Uber or Waze. Meaning you can’t use Dual Apps to make GPS working in Google apps like Google Maps. For these apps, you’ll have to wait for Xiaomi to release an update. </p>
<p> 3: Battery drains </p>
<p> On paper, the Redmi Note 7 boasts a great battery capacity, that’s at the very top of its class. But when it comes to real life usage, the battery life is, well, also great. For some users. The others, less fortunate ones, have to deal with a strange drain that drastically shortens the battery life. </p>
<p> As it’s usually the case with battery drains on a new phone, the cause is unknown. It could be a software problem caused by a recent update, or the issue might be on your end. </p>
<p> According to the forums, it’s probably not your fault, as your current MIUI version drains more battery than it should. You guessed it, the solution is to wait for an update that will (hopefully) improve the battery life. </p>
<p> While you’re waiting for that rescuing update, here are a few things you can try to improve the battery life: </p>
<p> Uninstall battery consuming apps. Check the battery usage per app by going to Settings > Battery & performance > Power usage. </p>
<p> Turn off system animations: Settings > Additional settings > Accessibility > Remove animations. </p>
<p> Restrict background app processes: Settings > Additional settings > Developer options > Background process limit > reduce the number of background processes. </p>
<p> Disable automatic brightness: Settings > Display > Brightness level > disable automatic brightness and adjust it manually. </p>
<p> 4: Background apps closing </p>
<p> As much as the previous solutions are helpful for extending the battery life on your Note 7, they also require compromises. Because you simply cannot have one thing without sacrificing another. Xiaomi knows this, so the company actually made some efforts to automatize that “sacrificing process” and make power management easier for users. That’s how a feature called MIUI optimization was introduced. </p>
<p> This feature automatically restricts certain processes on your phone, in order to extend the battery life while eliminating the need for any tweaks on users’ end. Sure, MIUI Optimization improves power management, but compromises are sometimes too big for users to bear with. </p>
<p> In the Note 7’s case, the MIUI optimization feature seems to automatically close the apps running in the background. Usually, that shouldn’t bother you, but if the apps you regularly use are being constantly closed, you’d probably want this to stop happening. </p>
<p> The obvious solution for this is to disable the MIUI Optimization feature. Yes, disabling it will slightly shrink the battery life, but you probably won’t even notice the difference. What makes the case for disabling this feature even stronger are reports of MIUI Optimization interfering with some non-MIUI based apps, eventually causing even more problems, as mentioned in this forum post. </p>
<p> To disable MIUI Optimization, you need to have Developer options enabled first. To enable Developer options, go to Settings > About Phone > tap the MIUI version 7 times, until the message saying “You’re now a developer!” appears. </p>
<p> Now that we have access to Developer options, here’s how to disable MIUI Optimization: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Additional settings > Developer options. </p>
<p> Find MIUI Optimization, and disable it. </p>
<p> 5: Face unlock not working </p>
<p> This one is as old as the face unlocking technology in Xiaomi phones. And the answer to the question “why can’t I use the Face unlock feature on my brand new Xiaomi phone” is always the same. It’s not available in your region! </p>
<p> Face unlock is restricted in most areas of the world. Some regions will get this feature with future system updates, some won’t. So, if you’re in an unsupported region, but still want to be able to unlock your phone with your face, the only solution is to switch to a supported region. </p>
<p> Your best bet, in this case, is Hong Kong, since the Face Unlock on the Redmi Note 7 is confirmed to work in this region. To change your phone’s region, go to Settings > Additional Settings > Region, and set it to Hong Kong. </p>
<p> 6: Notifications not showing </p>
<p> And finally, a problem that’s common to many Xiaomi phones. You probably find it very annoying that notifications only briefly show in the bar next to the clock, and the immediately disappear. </p>
<p> This wouldn’t even make it to the list of problems if the Note 7 had a huge notch. There simply wouldn’t be enough space for additional icons. But since the Note 7 features a teardrop notch, there’s plenty of space left for notifications. </p>
<p> Apparently, the current version of MIUI (10.3.6 at the time of writing) isn’t well optimized for different notch sizes. So, the pattern stays the same, regardless of whether your phone has a gigantic notch, or just a teardrop. </p>
<p> There are rumors MIUI 11 will fix this inconvenience. So, the only thing left for you is to bear with disappearing icons, and hope the next system version (expected in a month or two) will deal with this. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I certainly hope this article helped you resolve (or at least better understand) your problems with the Note 7. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, just write them down in the comments below. </p>

<p> i have a really huge problem about my Redmi Note 7. I bought it last June 2019 and it starts to have a defect this November. My phone defect is that it often shut down even though its battery percentage is 87% and I can’t turn it on when I want to and after two days it will open and battery percentage is in drain. I dont really know what to do. and I consult it in the Redmi Technician but it always turn back in the same defect. Help me Guys. </p>
<p> A few weeks ago I updated my RN 7(which I have since August this year) to MIUI 10.3.6, and since then I have issues with battery drain which I didn’t have prior to update to MIUI 10,and today I have updated it to MIUI 11 version 11.0.4.0, I didn’t do the hard reset at all,and the battery still drains a lot,I use just a few apps and turn off wifi when not using my phone because battery drainage is lesser with wifi off. Any suggestions what to do next? And if I do hard reset (if really necessary) will it… Read more » </p>
<p> Hard reset won’t remove MIUI 11. You can try disabling Auto-brightness and manually setting a brightness level. Alternatively, try with the hard reset, just make sure to back up your data. </p>

<p> How to fix Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 microphone issues </p>
<p> Xiaomi is taking over. The Chinese manufacturer has been producing some great mid-budget handheld devices and receives critical acclaim from both professionals and customers. Additionally, MIUI, the Android-based OS, works as good as you would expect. </p>
<p> However, same as Android, it has its known issues. One of the most reported issues is related to the microphone. Or better, mics. That goes for multiple Xiaomi models, but today we’ll try to address the most popular one. </p>
<p> Of course, we are talking about the Redmi Note 3. This specific device packs two microphones. In theory, they should improve sound but it seems that is not the case always. Somehow they occasionally provoke low sound quality, both in-call and while recording. Nonetheless, there are a few solutions available for this issue. We collected most useful ones, with the hope to help you overcome this problem. </p>
<p> Disable Google Now </p>
<p> Xiaomi’s MIUI stands shoulder to shoulder with the Android operating system. For global market, they offer a quite clean system without excessive bloatware. Also, they implemented a lot of Android features. However, implementing and optimizing those features are two things apart. Google Assistant (Google Now) is a known culprit for the mic issues and you should disable it. </p>
<p> Tap Search & Now. </p>
<p> Choose Voice. </p>
<p> Tap OK Google detection. </p>
<p> Have in mind that this is just a temporary solution and that it should be permanently resolved with future updates. Then you can use your smart assistant in a seamless fashion. </p>
<p> Update your Firmware </p>
<p> Behind MIUI we have a group of knowledgeable enthusiasts and technicians that work hard for top results. Some of the better-known companies have to look up to this guys. However, for better or worse, updates are not functioning the same way as on Android. You’ll need to download ROM and upgrade with it, rather than download and install updates directly from update servers. Moreover, this way you’ll need to backup your data since everything from the internal memory will be wiped out. </p>
<p> Select the ROM you’ve transferred from PC. </p>
<p> The upgrade should start and you’ll be prompted to confirm. </p>
<p> After the process is finished, start your device and test the microphone. </p>
<p> Use SoundAbout app to configure the mic </p>
<p> One of the temporary solutions is Sound About app from the Play Store. With this app, you can configure speakers and microphones. Additionally, and that is related to this problem, you can disable secondary microphone and therefore temporary improve the in-call sound quality. </p>
<p> Those were our solutions. As we already stated, they are just temporary workarounds until the developers fix the code. In case you have any questions or remarks, do tell us in the comments section. Or reach us out on Twitter. We look forward to helping you. </p>
<p> This model has another big problem. The mic in loud environment… If you try to record a Video or record a voice message you will notice the sound is useless like this video: https://youtu.be/2J02u1-cYrU Other brands works great in the same condition. No solution from Xiaomi and was reported more than a year, will try with the SoundAbout aplication. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy J3 most common issues and how to resolve them </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy J3 is more than a viable option in the lower low-budget category. If you’re not exceptionally demanding user and a loyal fan of Samsung handsets, J3 is well-suited for the job. However, for this and the majority of handsets, there are always issues that need to be addressed. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we prepared a list of most frequently reported problems provided by J3 users. Of course, we provided you with the proper troubleshooting steps, so make sure to check for your individual problem. We hope that you’ll find the remedy for your ache in the list below. </p>
<p> Battery issues </p>
<p> First, the main reason why people seem to deem the overall usability of this handset lackluster is the battery. The battery on J3 isn’t bad per se, and it certainly won the battle with the competition in 2016. Nonetheless, it’s the software within the device that drains the battery. So, even though the 2600 mAh battery is well-performing, there are still ways to improve the battery life and reduce the consumption. For that purpose, we enlisted some of those workarounds below: </p>
<p> Disable background apps. You can either do it manually within Settings > Application manager or by using the Smart Manager (Device Maintainance). Navigate to Settings > Device Maintainance > Unmonitored apps, and clear apps that are using the battery extensively while working in the background. </p>
<p> Use Battery Power Saving mode. Tap Settings > Device Maintainance > Battery and use one of two battery saving modes. </p>
<p> Disable GPS. You can either disable GPS permanently until an app acquires it or reduce the accuracy of the location service by changing location method to Phone only. Tap Settings > Connections > Enable Location > Location method, and switch to Phone only. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> In addition, make sure to uninstall the redundant and unused apps that are hogging on your device resources. We hope that with those, you’ll be able to extend your battery’s life. </p>
<p> Overheating issues </p>
<p> Overheating isn’t exactly a common problem, but it does affect certain users. And once it occurs, it’s likely to make your overall experience with the J3 quite hard to cope with. Moreover, if the phone is overheating over extended periods, you may encounter more than lags and stutters. Namely, in the worst case scenario, you can expect hardware failure. Obviously, it’s essential to address the overheating issue before it’s too late. </p>
<p> There are various reasons for this occurrence, and we advise you to check the following steps in order to prevent them: </p>
<p> Don’t use your phone while charging. </p>
<p> Check the resource hogging apps in the background. </p>
<p> Make sure that your battery isn’t faulty. </p>
<p> Remove the casing. </p>
<p> Don’t expose your handset to heat sources over an extended period of times. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Connectivity issues are generally not unusual for a multitude of Android handsets. Some of them suffer from the lackluster signal, while others are known for connection crashes. Either way, it’s hard to use your device as intended without the proper Wi-Fi connection. Almost impossible. Samsung Galaxy J3 isn’t exactly known for Wi-Fi issues, but some isolated cases are still enough for us to address the issue. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to follow the instructions below in order to troubleshoot Wi-Fi issues on your J3: </p>
<p> Forget Network and connect again. </p>
<p> Press and hold on Wi-Fi icon in the Notification panel to open Wi-Fi settings. </p>
<p> Use 5 GHz instead of 2.4 GHz and vice versa. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Turn off the device. Make sure that your battery is not critically low. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Up key + Home key + Power button. </p>
<p> Once the logo appears on the screen, release the Power button while holding the Volume Up key + Home key. </p>
<p> Wait for the Android logo to appear and release all buttons. </p>
<p> Use the Volume Down key to find and highlight the ‘wipe cache partition’ option. </p>
<p> Use the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Now, scroll down with the Volume Down key and highlight ”Yes”. </p>
<p> Mobile data issues </p>
<p> As same as with the Wi-Fi, some users experienced issues with the Mobile Data. Some of them weren’t able to use the 3G/4G as intended due to SIM card issues, while others encountered issues with unexpected signal drops and similar irregularities. Most of the time, the issue is closely related to an inappropriate position of the SIM card. Cellular signal drops are the best way to find out is your SIM card properly inserted in the SIM tray. </p>
<p> On the other hand, there are also some software issues that need to be examined, since the problem isn’t exclusively connected to the SIM card. Follow the instructions below to troubleshoot the mobile data issues on your Samsung Galaxy J3: </p>
<p> Reset your device. </p>
<p> Switch Network type. Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> TurnAirplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. Go to Settings > Connections> Mobile Networks > Tap Access Point Names > More > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> With that, you should be able to use the mobile data just like before. </p>
<p> SD card issues </p>
<p> SD card is of utmost importance if you want to store more multimedia since the device is limited to 16 GB of internal storage. However, users reported issues with SD cards, too. Namely, some of them weren’t able to transfer the data from internal storage to SD. Other – well – their J3 wouldn’t even recognize the SD card or suddenly unmounts it. For that purpose, we advise you to follow the steps below, since there are multiple ways to address this issue. </p>
<p> Power Off your device and remove SD card from the slot. Clean the slot with the compressed air and re-insert the SD card. </p>
<p> Backup your SD card on your PC and format it. Make sure to format or reformat the SD card and copy the backed-up content again. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Unexpected shutdown issues </p>
<p> If we take into consideration all enlisted issues of J3, this is probably the most intimidating one. Some users pointed out the major issue with regard to sudden restarts or even shutdowns. There are few reasons for this occurrence and we’re presenting them below: </p>
<p> The phone is overheating. </p>
<p> Custom ROM causes issues with the hardware. </p>
<p> Hardware failure. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to look at presented solutions for overheating issue and flash your device again. In addition, you can try to boot into the safe mode and examine the behavior. If the phone is working as intended, make sure to delete all lately installed apps. In contrary, if the device is still failing, it’s likely that we’re looking at hardware malfunction. So make sure to take your Samsung Galaxy J3 for repairs. </p>
<p> SIM card issues </p>
<p> You would imagine that this is a problem similar to the one with the SD card. Symptoms are obviously different, but the reason is, most of the time, inappropriate placement. On the other hand, with the latest updates, users with SIM card issues (sudden loss of network signal, mobile data loss, and ”Please insert SIM card” error) are rightfully suspecting the software involvement, as well. For that purpose, we prepared a list of possible solutions you should take into consideration: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Reinsert SIM card and/or switch SIM 1 and SIM 2 positions if you’re using dual-SIM option. </p>
<p> Try your SIM card in another handset to make sure it’s working. </p>
<p> Select ”3G only”. Navigate to Settings > Connections > Mobile Networks > Network Mode, and choose ”3G only” from the dropdown list. </p>
<p> Select proper access point. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth temporarily. </p>
<p> Boot in the safe mode and look for changes in the signal behavior. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> In the plethora of reported issues, it wouldn’t be fair to skip on Bluetooth issues. Bluetooth-related issues that are reported, mostly refer to failed pairing or unstable connection with the paired device. This mostly occurs in a pairing J3 with the car board. Or lack of it, to be exact. Luckily, if we exclude the hardware failure of the Bluetooth radio, there are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this problem. </p>
<p> Disable other network services while using Bluetooth (Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G). </p>
<p> ”Forget” device and try to pair again. </p>
<p> Wipe partition cache (process explained above). </p>
<p> That should do it. If you have alternative issues or solutions for the problems we presented above, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. We’ll be glad to help you. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> The hints here are not useful, some of them are wrong. e.g. Switching between 2.4GHz-WLAN and 5GHz-WLAN is impossible, because the J3 has no 5GHz-WLAN. also switching off IPv6 is useless, it makes the situation often worse than before </p>

<p> I bought J3 3 weeks ago and I like this phone. I don’t expect something amazing for the money I’ve paid. Smartphone has comparable parameters to 2015 Galaxy A5. But there’s a few things that I do not like in this smartphone : there’s no light sensor so you need to adjust the display backlight manually all the time – it’s irritating. The second issue is problem with maintaining Bluetooth connection. Your solution doesn’t make any sense for me because I need to use LTE and mobile router function at the same time that I use Bluetooth. Apart from that… Read more » </p>

<p> I just bought the j3 5 days ago. I do NOT like this phone. Bluetooth doesn’t work, lagging is insane, pages stutter and speaker phone makes every caller sound like they’re in a carwash! </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy S6 Nougat issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> For a lot of Android users around the globe lies the dilemma: older flagship or brand new mid-budget. If you ask us, we are cheering on the side of the older flagship devices. </p>
<p> For example, Samsung Galaxy S6. Amazing device, great design, sleek but occasionally erratic TouchWiz, stunning camera. What more you would expect from an Android smartphone? Well, lack of the timely and functioning software updates may come in question, but only because that’s a general problem with Samsung and not an individual handset issue. </p>
<p> So, recently, users of S6 received the Nougat via OTA update. And then the hell broke loose. Many of them reported a lot of issues and today we provided a list of most common issues and possible workarounds for each individual reported the problem. If you have a hard time with your S6 after an update, make sure to check the list below. </p>
<p> Call issues </p>
<p> We had to start with the essential feature that some users reported as broken. Well, imagine that you own an amazing feature-rich device but, there’s a little negligible problem: you can’t answer your calls. That happened to some users. The phone is ringing but nothing is shown on the screen. This is how one user explained the problem: </p>
<p> ”Since the Android update yesterday I go through periods where I cannot answer incoming calls. The phone rings but there is no indicator that there is an incoming call and icons or anything to even answer the incoming call. How do I correct this? I can restart my phone and I can answer incoming calls for a brief period then it start all over again where I can’t answer them. I have changed nothing on my phone. The only thing that has happened was the Android upgrade” </p>
<p> There’s an alternative, but the only permanent solution is a factory reset. At least, if you want to answer to your calls like you used to before the Nougat update. For an alternative solution, you can navigate to Settings > Accessibility > Answering and end calls > and enable “Answer calls by pressing the home key”. </p>
<p> However, you can perform a factory reset and have a good chance of resolving this issue. This is how to do it: </p>
<p> Backup your data and make sure that the phone’s battery is at least on 30%. </p>
<p> Open Backup & restore. </p>
<p> Tap Reset device. </p>
<p> Tap Erase everything. </p>
<p> Your device will restart and you should be able to answer calls just like before an update. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Even the fundamental connectivity was struck down for some users. Namely, some of them reported that they were unable to connect to both home or public networks after the update. One user offered a concise description of the problem at hand: </p>
<p> ”Got the new Android upday today (I have an S6) and tonight I couldn’t connect to a public Wi-Fi network. How do i fix this? I had no issues connecting before the update.” </p>
<p> These are some steps you should take in order to address the Wi-Fi issues: </p>
<p> Restart the router. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, make sure to address the issue to your carrier support center. </p>
<p> Camera issues </p>
<p> It seems that some of the native camera features are gone with the latest update. Allegedly, after the update, some users lost filters that were available on the previous Android version. This is how one user described his/her concerns regarding the subject: </p>
<p> ”I’ve only had my phone running for a day with the latest update, but the grayscale camera filter seems to be MIA and the low light resolution is sub par now. I always found the grayscale filter to give better photos in low light, so even though I can edit a color photo to make it grey…it’s not at all the same. I don’t see grayscale as an option for a filter to download, but has anyone else run into this and found a solution?” </p>
<p> As you would imagine, there isn’t a practical workaround for this. However, you can use an alternative app before the next system update to utilize your camera’s full potential with all the needed features. </p>
<p> Buttons/keys issues </p>
<p> Another key feature (no pun intended) is broken for some users. Namely, the Power and Home keys are unresponsive for some users periodically after the update rollout. This is how one S6 owner explained his problem and the way her/he resolved it: </p>
<p> ”After the Nougat update my power button intermittently stopped working, i.e. unable to turn screen on or if it is on, turn it off. Holding it down does nothing. After charging it for a bit, the problem seemed to go away. It was over 60% charged when I noticed the problem. Similarly, the home button either did nothing or opened Google assistant (did not hold the button, simply tapped it). I powered off and on. I cleared the cache. Yet the problem still persisted. For NOW, it seems to have returned to working normally. Only thing I did was let it charge for about 30 minutes during a car ride. There is something unstable in the code.’‘ </p>
<p> As you can see, this issue is somehow resolved by charging. On the other hand, if this strange occurrence is still there after a while, you should perform the factory reset. </p>
<p> Battery issues </p>
<p> Battery drains aren’t exactly a novelty for Samsung updates. After the S7 and S7 Edge battery issues, the battery life is substantially decreased on S6, as well. One user shared a thorough explanation behind this issue: </p>
<p> ”I’ve had my Samsung Galaxy S6 for around 16 months now. It seems like over the past 3-4 months the battery life has gotten worse, I’ve experienced a weird problem a few times too. Today, I was surprised look at my phone and see that the battery life was much lower than it should have been, since I had not been using my phone, it had just been in my pocket. Looking at the battery life chart in settings confirmed that there was a sudden drop in battery life a couple hours ago.” </p>
<p> As you can see for yourself, sudden drops of battery percentage are not uncommon after the update. However, you can perform a few tweaks to improve your battery life and those can be found in this article. </p>
<p> Wireless charging issues </p>
<p> Wireless charging is also impacted by the update. Some users reported that they’re unable to charge their devices with wireless chargers as soon as the system updated. One user summarized the problem this way: </p>
<p> ”Is anyone else having a problem with wireless charging after Nougat update? I keep my wireless charger on my desk at work. I did my update and then left. Came in the next day and the wireless isnt charging. Its not the charger because someone with an S7 and S8 have both tested it and they can charge on it. Any one else having this problem ?” </p>
<p> If you’re certain that the wireless charger is functional, you can wipe the cache partition and, if that’s not of any use, restore the factory settings. </p>
<p> Reboot/boot loop issues </p>
<p> Now, this is a dealbreaker for most of the users. Once they’ve installed the Nougat update, their respective devices get stuck on the welcome screen or the random resets started. One user presented the problem he has to cope with after the update: </p>
<p> ”Hi, I tried to update my firmware with the new Nougat upgrade last night. When I retrieved my phone this morning, it was frozen on the Verizon screen. I tried all of the tricks: rebooting the system, rebooting to bootloader, wiping the cache partition, and even doing a hard factory reset. Nothing has worked – not even the factory reset! It still freezes on the Verizon screen. Any advice for a self fix before I take it to a repair shop? Thanks!” </p>
<p> It seems that there’s no solution at the moment, at least not the one that can be performed by users themselves. So, if you’ve experienced similar issues, make sure to take your device to a service center. </p>
<p> Voicemail issues </p>
<p> This issue is not as much connected to a voicemail as it is an interface bug that causes the message playback to stop after the phone is close to your ear. It seems that the sensor bug affects the voicemail playback. Here is the description of the problem provided by one user: </p>
<p> ”I have visual voicemail and anytime I hit play and then put the phone to my ear to listen to the message the message pauses. The only way for me to listen to the voicemail is to put it on speaker phone. Anybody know a fix to this?” </p>
<p> Until now, the 3 workarounds proven as the best-suited for the job. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Voicemail app > Force stop, and restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable all lock screen security measures (pattern, PIN, password). </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> But, for most of the users, the problem is still there. So, we should expect some fixes in the upcoming app and system versions. </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> At the end, it’s important to say that some of these may be the isolated cases and the Nougat update work’s as intended on your Samsung handset. However, there’s also a possibility that we missed some of the issues, so you’re welcome to share them in the comments section. </p>
<p> Either way, we certainly hope that the Samsung and the carriers will work their way out of this in the next update that’s at the moment in the beta stage. </p>

<p> Sometime after the update, I noticed that when on mobile data, Messenger loads real slowly, Facebook is very inconsistent, and Internet Browser does not work at all. Everything works normally when on wifi at home though… Apparently my sister has been having the same issue… </p>

<p> Both my (S6 Edge) and my wife’s (S6) Samsung phones after Nougat update is facing some weird issues. The issue is essentially that when you are talking on speaker phone, the phone screen will not turn off even when you press the power button. It turns back on automatically. After some troubleshooting, is seems to be appearing when WhatsApp is installed. I have found this out after hardware reset and installing one app at a time. Does anyone else have this issue? We are also facing not being able to receive phone calls and not being able to send text… Read more » </p>
<p> Thanks for sharing. We don’t think that the restoring from backup will affect your troubleshooting. But it’s indeed strange for WhatsApp to cause those kinds of problems. Please, give us a shout after if you discover the instigator of the mentioned issues. Meanwhile, we’ll look into that and respond if some solution appears. </p>
<p> So, quick update. So, far it still seems to be working great without WhatsApp. My phone screen stays off during speaker phone call as well as Bluetooth calls in cars (forgot to mention this in earlier post). Actually, this screen staying on was actually found in three different places. 1) During phone call when phone is either in speaker or not in speaker and placed on the desk. Once again even when you pressed power off it did not stay off. 2) Phone call over Bluetooth in car. Screen will not go off and comes right back on after screen… Read more » </p>

<p> I don’t have those issues. Two days ago my s6 edge got destroyed by google assistant. The assistant started turning it self on by it self, now it turns on the camera too. I turned it off following online instructions I found and its still turning on. My home button is dead most of the day but the sensor is working. Lock button sometimes works, sometimes don’t. When apps and cam start turning off and on , I have to wait for the battery to go 0% for the phone to turn off so that I can charge it and… Read more » </p>

<p> I am using a S6 SM-G920V originally from Verizon unlocked After 7.0 update every time I boot phone it says searching for service & can’t receive calls or texts unless I dial any number first. I changed to a new sim card & that not fixed it. I tried a non activated AT&T & Tracfone sim & a non activated Verizon sim & it says the carrier like it should. Once you activate it the problem exists again. Using a non Verizon sim says this is not a Verizon phone which is annoying but can’t disable that. GPS not work… Read more » </p>

<p> Android O Developer Preview: Known Issues and Bugs Round-Up </p>
<p> Even though a lot of Android users are still waiting for an update to Nougat 7.0, Google announced brand new OS. Android Oreo or Oreos is the 8th Android installment and should be available for consumers in August or September 2017. </p>
<p> For the time being, Google released Developers Preview version that should showcase upcoming features. It’s available only for Google-powered devices, namely for: </p>
<p> Pixel </p>
<p> Nexus Player </p>
<p> So if you have one of these models, you can try out Android O. However, have in mind that this is not a stable version and you can encounter a large variety of issues. For that purpose, we listed some of the known issues for this preview release, so you can know what to expect. </p>
<p> Known issues of Android O Developer Preview </p>
<p> System User Interface Issues </p>
<p> With Android O, Google conducted various changes and improvements with UI. Sadly, you may have a hard time experiencing those when we consider these reported issues: </p>
<p> ”System UI crash after toggling screen brightness, then going to Overview (recent) and selecting a new app. </p>
<p> Occasional issues navigating Home, with incomplete transition making the device unusable. </p>
<p> Taps in Quick Settings may be registered in another location. </p>
<p> When using Autofill, an “Android system app displaying on top” message is sometimes shown, but it can be ignored (if it’s turned off, it will disable Autofill).” </p>
<p> Google Cloud Messaging/Firebase Cloud Messaging </p>
<p> Cloud Messaging is also unstable in this preview version. These are the problems that occurred with some users: </p>
<p> ”FCM doesn’t work in a secondary profile unless the app is also installed on the primary profile. If the app is not installed on the primary profile, an FCM token is not generated in the secondary profile. </p>
<p> Developers using FCM/GCM with Android O should update their Google Play services SDK to version 10.2.1, which is available from the SDK manager in Android Studio.” </p>
<p> Android TV Issues </p>
<p> The Nexus Player has specific issues on its own. We are bringing you whole detailed list below. </p>
<p> ”Setting up a restricted profile then restarting the device causes the device to be unusable. </p>
<p> Typing in the search bar causes a crash. </p>
<p> PIP image does not fill the window. </p>
<p> Launching applications via voice command does not work. </p>
<p> Application size is not displayed in Application Settings. </p>
<p> Microphone button on remote control does not work. </p>
<p> Factory reset does not work on Fugu. </p>
<p> Connected remote control device disconnects intermittently. </p>
<p> USB connected drive cannot be formatted. The Setup as device storage formatting option does not work properly for drive attached via USB. </p>
<p> Device may freeze with blank homescreen when plug is inserted. </p>
<p> Location status in Settings may become disabled with user unable to re-enable. </p>
<p> Not able to reorder games in the apps and games row. </p>
<p> Content may not play after relaunching media apps.” </p>
<p> Android for Work and Device Manager Issues </p>
<p> Android for Work is a great feature that let you create and manage work-specific profile separately from the private one. At the moment, there is a single reported issue regarding Android for Work. </p>
<p> ”Enabling a Work Profile may cause a crash in Settings app. To work around this issue, remove and re-add the Work Profile.” </p>
<p> Besides that, users reported occasional crashes while trying to access the Device Manager. </p>
<p> ”Selecting the Settings > Security and Screen Lock > Android Device Manager menu item may cause a crash. Updating to the latest version of Google Play services will resolve this issue.” </p>
<p> Android Wear Issues </p>
<p> Besides handsets and Android TV, Android Wear has also support trough Android Emulator System Images. However, it’s not without issues. </p>
<p> ”Embedded app installation from Play Store can sometimes crash. Side-loading can be used to work around this issue. </p>
<p> Only the x86 emulator is currently supported. </p>
<p> Default watch face complications may not load until you switch watch faces or otherwise touch watch face settings, or reboot the device.” </p>
<p> Wi-Fi Issues </p>
<p> With Android O, Wi-Fi will receive additional interesting features. Additionally, there is one distinguished error and it’s concerning special services calls. </p>
<p> ”611 call can’t be made on a Wi-Fi profile.” </p>
<p> Performance and Battery Issues </p>
<p> As you would expect, this is release is not advisable for everyday use. It is quite buggy and unstable performance-wise. </p>
<p> ”System and app performance is known to be periodically slow / janky, and device may become occasionally unresponsive. These problems may become more acute with prolonged use. </p>
<p> Some apps may not function normally on Developer Preview 1. This includes Google’s apps as well as other apps. </p>
<p> This release has various stability and performance issues on all devices that make it not suitable for daily use on phone or tablet, especially for non-developers.” </p>
<p> Moreover, the same goes for battery. If you are willing to try out Android O Developer Preview, prepare for battery drainage. </p>
<p> ”Battery life may be regressed in this early release for screen-on and screen-off use cases.” </p>
<p> And with the lack of percentage that is removed from UI, you won’t be able to determine consumption as easily as before. </p>
<p> Other Issues </p>
<p> Besides best-known issues, you may face a variety of secondary issues related to lack of optimization. Don’t forget that some of the apps/features you may use are still not compatible with novelties that Android O brings to the table. </p>
<p> ”Using the Google Drive app’s PDF viewer to load a PDF document may cause the device to freeze. </p>
<p> Apps or games may hit ANRs in GLThread, such as with , that cause crash or failure to load properly. </p>
<p> Games using Google Play games services may have problems with sign-in. </p>
<p> The latest release of Android Auto may not work properly on Developer Preview 1. </p>
<p> The NDK cannot build targeting Android O DP1 (an upcoming r15 release will fix).” </p>
<p> Have in mind that these are only the ‘noticed’ issues since we are too early in this release phase. So, a large variety of unlisted issues can occur. Additionally, features like Android Pay are not available due to security reasons. </p>
<p> At the end, unless you’re a developer or knowledgeable enthusiast, we don’t advise you to install Developers Preview. Soon enough we should be able to download Beta version with CTS (Compatibility Test Suite) approval. That should be much safer to work with. </p>
<p> What are your first thoughts on Android O? What are the changes you eagerly await? </p>

<p> No internet when off of wifi even though mobile data enabled. Very slow recharge using USB A cable. Fast battery drain. </p>
<p> I went on here to see if anyone’s settings app crashes when opened Everytime. The only way I can get in there is though quick toggles and if I’m in airplane mode. WiFi and Bluetooth can be on but not service (cumsumer Cellular) hate it dont use switching to project fi when the Sim comes in. Other then that a super stable experience </p>
<p> I was on speaker phone today and when I hung up the phone still take 5 min to perform the task of hanging up and return to the home screen. </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> After the update i dont know what has happened to the speakers. 1)Whatsapp in app notifications sometimes comes with a weird sound with the default one. 2)When playing a video or while calling, a click like sound comes before they start ! </p>

<p> iPhone 6. When recording WhatsApp voice messages or voice memos he sound is so muted you can barely hear it. But FaceTime works perfect. The update definitely affected the microphone but not on all apps. </p>

<p> Thank you for sharing, guys! It looks like installing iOS 11.1.2 on non-X iPhones is indeed a bad idea. </p>

<p> I’m using a 5s. Loading iOS 11 was a huge mistake. Since loading it and it’s interations have caused battery charging and draining problems. The phone runs slower on some apps including opening email and notes. </p>
<p> Once my charging issues are corrected I will no longer jump onto iOS updates. </p>

<p> After updating to 11.1.2 my screen (Iphone 6) is somewhat unresponsive. When i sometomes press to open an app, nothing happens, and then after a while it may react as if i tapped somewhere else on the screen, and open another app ? </p>
<p> my Iphone 7 plus gets extremely hot and the battery goes down like a timer from 100% to 0 and now it doesnt want to charge and stuck at low 40% 🙁 </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy A50 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy A50 is steadily climbing the ladder to the top of the mid-range segment. It appears that the phone became an instant success, as Samsung reshaped its mid-range strategy to bring an even better pack for the value. </p>
<p> Sure, the Galaxy A50 is an all-around exceptional device. But no smartphone is perfect, as some issues arise sooner or later. And this has nothing to do with the A50 being a mid-range device. After all, the Galaxy S10 has a plethora of issues, as well. It all comes down to how you use your phone. </p>
<p> So, if you recently encountered a certain problem on your Galaxy A50, chances are I’ll mention it in this article. Just find the problem you’re looking for, and I hope you’ll find the solution, as well. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Fingerprint issue </p>
<p> Although the A50 doesn’t feature an ultra-sonic fingerprint sensor, as its flagship cousin does, we can still include it in the first generation of smartphones to boast an optical in-display scanner. As much as Samsung (and all other companies) tested it before the official launch, it’s still the first generation. And the first generation of any tech isn’t the most reliable one. </p>
<p> Users notice that in everyday use. There are numerous reports of the fingerprint sensor missing the scan or not working properly. If you too have to say a few bad words about the in-display scanner, I’m sorry, but you just have to bear with it and keep in mind it’s the first generation tech that doesn’t work as intended every time. </p>
<p> Sure, Samsung promises software updates that will supposedly improve the fingerprint scanner’s responsiveness and accuracy, but whether that will indeed be the case is questionable. The only thing left for you is to keep your phone up to date and hope for the best. Changing or removing the screen protector could also be helpful, but I honestly doubt it’s the main reason for the slow fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> 2. No LED notification light </p>
<p> If you’re wondering why the LED light doesn’t blink when you receive a notification (as it probably did on your previous smartphone), it’s because the Galaxy A50 doesn’t have one. This is not a problem per se, but maybe you missed this information when researching the A50 before you bought it, so it doesn’t hurt if I mention it again. </p>
<p> 3. Internet connection problems </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing internet connection problems, try clearing the browser cache and data. If the issue persists, check this article for additional solutions. </p>
<p> 4. Bluetooth problems </p>
<p> A few users reported an unusual Bluetooth problem that prevents them from pairing their phone with a Bluetooth device. Apparently, there’s still no real solution to this problem. Hopefully, Samsung will address the pairing issue in some of the future updates. </p>
<p> Sure, I can tell you to try generic solutions like restarting your phone, re-establishing the connection, check if the Airplane mode is disabled, but I doubt any of these will actually resolve the problem. It won’t hurt if you try, though. </p>
<p> 5. Battery drains </p>
<p> Battery drain is perhaps the biggest problem A50 owners face right now. And when your phone has a 4000 mAh battery, the last thing you have in mind is a battery drain. But it just seems to be happening. </p>
<p> Apparently, some of the recent updates messed up with battery, so there’s really nothing you can do, except waiting for Samsung to release a fixing update. Nobody knows when will it happen, so keep checking every day. </p>
<p> In the meantime, make sure some other factors don’t affect the battery life. For example, go to Settings > Battery usage, and see which app consumes the most power. If you notice something unusual, uninstall or at least limit that app. </p>
<p> 6. Can’t play Netflix in HD </p>
<p> In case you’re unable to play Netflix videos in HD, I have bad news for you. Streaming Netflix in HD is not supported on the Galaxy A50! But it shouldn’t be like this, because the Galaxy A50 supports the Widevine L1 DRM, which is enough to play HD videos on streaming platforms. </p>
<p> However, even if the phone has the prerequisites, Netflix is hesitant to allow it to stream HD content for some reason. Nobody knows when/if this conflict will be resolved. What we do know is that some older versions of the Netflix app actually allow HD content, which adds up to the confusion even more. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, if you can’t live without watching Netflix in HD, you can install an APK file of some previous version of the app. According to users, the last working version is Netflix 6.20.1 build 51 31579. </p>
<p> 7. Screen brightness too high </p>
<p> Samsung’s AMOLED displays are great, maybe the best in the business! But the vibrant colors and screen brightness might seem a bit unusual, especially for users coming from IPS displays. </p>
<p> So, if the screen on your new Galaxy A50 appears too bright, it’s just the way Samsung AMOLED displays work and should look. However, you can still adjust some settings to make the screen more appealing to your eyes. </p>
<p> Just go to settings, and change the screen mode to Basic. Even if you’re not satisfied with the end result, give it some time for your eyes and brain to get accustomed to the new vibrant screen. </p>
<p> That’s about it. If you’ve encountered a problem I didn’t list in this article or you have some additional questions, write it down in the comments below, and we’ll try to find the solution together. </p>

<p> I have this phone and it has given me nothing but problems. The Bluetooth in the car will not connect unless I shut down my phone and then restart it. My screen will blink on and off constantly. My battery has gone from 100% to 5% in two hours from the blinking on and off. It is less then 6 months old. I would not suggest this phone to anyone. </p>

<p> Further to the already mentioned fingerprint issues: I set mine up for fingerprints, then had difficulty turning them off again. Then I set up the pin lock and could NOT turn it off. It came into play EVERY time the screen shut down (an absolute nuisance) but there is no obvious way to turn it off. Eventually I had to take it in to a store to get them to turn it off for me. Current issue is that while I can download from the “Galaxy Store”, there is something blocking the Android “Play Store” so I cannot get important… Read more » </p>

<p> Recently purchased the A50 from Verizon. Sweet phone! But….. From Day 1 had fingerprint issues, where the finger print would not be recognized when unlocking the phone, but would pass the test of the fingerprints. I’ve rebooted the phone, deleted and reinstalled both thumb prints, updated any software, etc. But still it didnt work correctly. I would be putting my PIN in more then using my fingerprints. A real negative for such a great phone. I read an article (I would love to find it again and give credit to the poster) about how you set up your finger print… Read more » </p>

<p> Redmi Note 8 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Xiaomi doesn’t play around and the output of devices they introduce yearly is crazy for all industry standards. Not even 8 months after the Chinese giant introduced the Redmi Note 7 (and its variations, 7S and 7 Pro), the Redmi Note 8 (along with 8 Pro and 8T) have hit the market. </p>
<p> This appears to be a great device, just like its predecessor, with the Penta-camera (if we include the selfie cam) setup being the major upgrade over the Redmi Note 7. The device has its flaws but they are hard not to look over considering the price point of Note 8. </p>
<p> Today, we made sure to provide you with the list of the most common Redmi Note 8 issues with applicable solutions. If you have any problems with the device, continue reading below or just jump to a section of your interest. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Touchscreen is laggy </p>
<p> Some users reported that the touchscreen (display) is laggy and that was later identified as a software issue on the official global ROM. In our knowledge, the problem is dealt with on later updates. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, if the display is laggy or animations are slow, make sure to follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > My device > System and check for updates. Install an update if available. </p>
<p> Enable Developer options (Settings > My device > All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number). Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options and disable MIUI Optimization at the bottom. </p>
<p> Get back in Developer options and reduce Animation from 1 to 0.5. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings (the procedure is explained at the bottom of this article). </p>
<p> 2. Battery drain issues </p>
<p> Although the 4000 mAh battery should be big enough to give the Redmi Note 8 an exquisite Screen-on Time, users are reporting issues with battery drains. There are multiple things that might affect battery life but, when it comes to MIUI-powered devices, our first suspect is a lack of optimization on the current ROM. </p>
<p> Updates cause battery drains and new updates usually solve them. So, first of all, make sure that your Redmi Note 8 is up to date in regards to the firmware. After that, you can check these tips to reduce battery drains significantly: </p>
<p> Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Disable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and individually disable Autostart on apps. </p>
<p> Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery. </p>
<p> 3. SIM card won’t activate </p>
<p> Moving on, there are reports about the SIM card not working. Namely, it seems that the SIM card won’t activate on this handset for some European and Asian users. Now, we need you to ensure that your device is on the Global MIUI ROM where all necessary bands are available. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, try reinserting the SIM card into the alternative socket and try again. Make sure to reboot your device after doing so. If the problem is still persistent, update the firmware or reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> There’s a slight chance that we are looking at the manufacturing defect, so you can also contact your retailer for service. </p>
<p> 4. Notification icons not showing </p>
<p> Missing notifications on MIUI is probably the longest-running problem Xiaomi/Redmi users experienced. The fact that someone at their software development department decided that it’s a good idea for notification icons to disappear after a few seconds from the Status bar is preposterous. </p>
<p> Luckily, you don’t have to worry about that the moment MIUI gets available. Which already is, although based on Android 9 Pie instead of Android 10. </p>
<p> The problem with notifications is completely solved on MIUI 11, but if you are still not seeing notification icons, here’s how to enable them with ease: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open Display. </p>
<p> Select Notch & status bar. </p>
<p> Under the Status bar section, enable Show icons for incoming notifications. </p>
<p> 5. Low sound volume on headphones </p>
<p> This is also quite a common occurrence, especially on wireless (Bluetooth) headphones or buds. Users say that the volume on their headphones is not high at all, even on the highest settings. Seemingly, there is a workaround to it and we already wrote about it, here. </p>
<p> What you need to do is toggle on the Disable absolute volume option in the Developer options menu. </p>
<p> An alternative is to tweak audio output with certain Magisk modules, which requires root. We don’t recommend that approach if you are not experienced with modding ROMs. </p>
<p> 6. Google Assistant not working </p>
<p> Another quite common problem reported on various forums concerns Google Assistant that won’t work on the Redmi Note 8. The Voice Match for Google Assistant’s voice commands appears greyed out for some users. </p>
<p> This problem seems to be related to MIUI, both 10 and 11, and we don’t have any official response by Xiaomi. There are some things you can try in order to resolve this but, as we said already, this is a widespread issue and, until Xiaomi resolves the problem with their OS skin, we can mainly wait. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to try and solve Google Assistant not working on Redmi Note 8: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Google and clear cache and data. </p>
<p> Leave the Google Beta program from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Uninstall Google updates and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings > Apps > Manage apps. Tap on the 3-dot menu and open Default apps. From there, open Assist & voice input. Under the Assist app, select Google. </p>
<p> Delete and retrain the Voice model. </p>
<p> 7. The Call recording option is missing </p>
<p> This isn’t a bug or anything similar. Namely, due to rules in different regions and in accordance with Google’s privacy regulations (they paid a hefty fee for privacy infringement case), Xiaomi won’t deliver their Contacts and dialer app with an option to record calls. This option is not allowed in Europe and various other regions around the globe. </p>
<p> So, if you badly want this option, consider unlocking the bootloader and flashing either an official ROM from supported regions or flashing Xiaomi EU ROM that has it. </p>
<p> 8. Delay on Lock Screen </p>
<p> This can fall into the overall lag issues with the device but we decided to give it a separate spot on the list. Namely, some users have said that there’s an unexpected 4 seconds delay when they are on the Lock Screen and just after unlocking the device. </p>
<p> For the time being, we don’t have many insights to offer but you can try disabling Tap to wake and disabling the double-press Power button to start a camera. Alternatively, you should ensure that the firmware is up to date or reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 9. GCAM not working on Note 8 </p>
<p> One of the best things about the Redmi Note 8 is that it supports Google Camera ports without rooting your device. Although you won’t be able to utilize all lenses with GCAM, the standard mode photography along with the Night Mode are much better than on the stock camera app. </p>
<p> However, since the device is (still) new, users run into a lot of GCAM ports that crash or won’t work in certain mods. We recommend downloading the GCAM from an acknowledged developer, here. </p>
<p> Just make sure to, before you run the app for the first time, clear all cache and data. That will prevent crashes. </p>
<p> 10. Tips: How to wipe cache partition or factory reset Redmi Note 8 </p>
<p> Finally, we made sure to provide you with two valuable procedures that, if things go awry, might help you get your device in the working condition again. </p>
<p> Here’s how to wipe cache partition on Redmi Note 8 and solve certain issues: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> And this is how to reset your device to factory settings: </p>
<p> Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> Additionally, if you dislike bloatware that comes with MIUI, we have just the right article for you. Learn how to easily debloat your Redmi Note 8 with the steps explained here. No unlocking bootloader or root needed. </p>
<p> With that side note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and we hope this piece shed some light on issues you experienced.

<p> In my phone after I change my settings to something else it goes back to previous setting by itself. For example if I have disabled auto brightness after a while auto brightness is enabled again, if I have enabled vibrate on tap after a while the settings goes back to disabled I cannot understand the problem. </p>

<p> Huawei P10 Lite common issues, and how to resolve them </p>
<p> Huawei’s enormous growth is well-justified by the devices they delivered in the last few years. It’s only the question of time before they get to contest first place with Apple or Samsung. And latest flagship ”P” handsets are definitely a step forward in many regards. </p>
<p> Even though P10 Lite isn’t on the same level as P10 and P10 plus flagships, it’s an amazing mid-range handset that rewards users with a slick design, great IPS LCD screen and overall above-average performance. It comes with the latest version of Huawei Android variation, EMUI 5.1, and to date, P10 Lite received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, after some time, issues started to pile up. Don’t get us wrong, this is is the case with most other devices and the problems we enlisted below aren’t common and widespread. But, if you have any issues with your latest acquisition, make sure to check the list below and look up for a solution. </p>
<p> Battery drainage </p>
<p> Huawei is not known for fast battery drainage on previous devices, but, it seems that the latest addition to P lite series is somewhat troubled in that regard. With the 3000 mAh, P10 Lite battery doesn’t lack longevity, at least if you’re not an intensive user. Fast charging is a great improvement over P9 and will let you recharge much faster. However, it seems that the EMUI 5.1 kind of drains more battery than EMUI 5.0 and the more demanding screen is a greater consumer, too. </p>
<p> Some users reported that the battery life is underwhelming, so we prepared some tips for you to improve it. If you’re unsure what to do, the steps below should be informative. </p>
<p> Disable power-consuming background apps. You can do that within the Phone Manager > Lock Screen Cleanup. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location Mode, and choose Device only if you’re not in need of GPS’s high accuracy at the moment. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location > 3-dot Menu > Scan settings, and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, respectively. </p>
<p> Reset phone in Safe mode and look for changes. If the battery life is much longer, that would imply that some 3rd-party app is hogging on your battery. Most of the time, the problem is resolved by uninstalling lately installed apps. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Disable Auto brightness and set a preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Slow speed and lag </p>
<p> In the hardware department, P10 Lite is probably one of the best-buy models in the mid-range category. It’s fast and reliable as they come. However, the occasional issues with performance aren’t unusual. Some of them reported freezes after unlocking while others have had experienced performance drops while running some demanding games. </p>
<p> Even the manufacturer said that the eMMC memory instead of faster UFS. That’s just like that. Another thing that might affect performance drops is related to overheating which we will address below. </p>
<p> If you’ve experienced something similar, there are some things you can do to resolve the issue. </p>
<p> Restart your device. If it won’t react to standard Power Off procedure, you can force shut down by holding the Power button long enough. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. Follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Let the phone cool down for a while. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> SIM card issues </p>
<p> Just as the previous iterations in P Lite series, P10 Lite supports either dual-SIM or SIM + SD card variation. Now, it’s not exactly hard to set up preferred cards in the compartment, but there are some things to know. Firstly, only the primary SIM card supports 3G and above technologies. Second is exclusively bound to 2G. So, if you’ve experienced connection losses or a network coverage error, make sure to check which card you use. </p>
<p> In addition, you should double check is everything set as intended before the suspicion of hardware malfunction arises. In addition, you can restart your device and look for changes. After that, you shouldn’t have any problems with the SIM card. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issue </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues were not uncommon for Huawei handsets before, and they are still present for some users of P10 Lite. Some of them reported connectivity issues while trying to pair their phone with the car media board or a wireless headset. For some, the connection is unstable and crashing frequently, while others weren’t able to connect in the first place. Firstly, you must make sure that the P10 Lite is the culprit for the failed pairing. Check connection with multiple devices to make sure that the phone is the problem. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, follow the instructions below to resolve the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Make sure that the Airplane mode is disabled. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Clear pairing and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Try disabling Wi-Fi and Mobile Data while using Bluetooth. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, you should contact your vendor or responsible carrier since the problem is certainly hardware-related. </p>
<p> Fingerprint scanner issues </p>
<p> The fingerprint scanner is more than a useful feature on flagship devices. But, lately, even the mid-range devices are packing reader with a variety of nifty uses. And Huawei is one of the first large manufacturers that started implementing fingerprint reader on the majority of its devices. The scanner on Huawei P10 Lite is just as fast and well-placed like on P9. But, there’s still a problem or two regarding its occasional erratic behavior. </p>
<p> There are some workarounds you can apply before concurring that the hardware is the problem. </p>
<p> Clean your fingerprint scanner. Use a wet cloth to clean the fingerprint scanner of dirt. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable fingerprint gestures. Open Settings > Fingerprint ID, and disable all gestures except the standard unlock feature. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> In the end, if the problem is persistent, contact your vendor or carrier and report the problem. </p>
<p> Volume issues </p>
<p> Certain users reported issues with the sound volume of certain apps notifications and many other aspects, with the exclusion of ringer sound that works as intended. Namely, some of them reported too loud or quiet notifications and other multimedia features. And even though they tried to regulate or even mute the sound, it still remained the same. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to wait for the future update which should resolve the sound bug. Meanwhile, you can use the ”Do not disturb” mode to disable certain sounds. In addition, try some of these workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Boot in safe mode. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC with HiSuite. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> Overheating issues </p>
<p> Another problem that emerged with the introduction of massive hardware improvements is the overheating. And most of the modern smartphones will eventually get hot, but some of them are more prone to it than others. Huawei P10 Lite, for example, is prone to overheating. Especially in the upper back part. Don’t get us wrong, this occurrence requires certain circumstances, like intensive gaming or exposure to the sun for an extended period, or use during charging. </p>
<p> Because of that, make sure to keep your phone far from the heat sources and leave it be while fast charging. In addition, don’t use alternative, commercial chargers instead of the one OEM provided you with. </p>
<p> Moreover, if the device overheating occurs during the idle state or standard use, make sure to take it for repair or ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Besides the Bluetooth issue, there are additional problems that are also related to connectivity. Namely, some users reported poor Wi-Fi signal or constant disconnection while using P10 Lite. In addition, others are experiencing poor connection while using Mobile data. There are so many factors for this occurrence, and many of those are not exclusively phone-related. </p>
<p> We enlisted some of the probable solutions for the problem and you can find them just below. </p>
<p> Mobile Data troubleshooting: </p>
<p> Switch Network type. Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. Go to Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Forget network and re-establish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz. It lacks range, but it’s a more stable option. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition within Recovery settings. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> After that, your connectivity issues should be long gone. In contrary, if those steps failed to resolve the issue at hand, make sure to report the problem to service or to manufacturer support itself. </p>
<p> That should be it. If you have any additional problems or alternative solutions for the ones presented, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> It’s probably your best shot to resolve that issue. It’s most certainly code error that can be solved only by resetting to factory settings. </p>
<p> What if my max blinked then it has white lines on top..?I tried to restart but it made my phone shut down totaly what else can you offer to do..? </p>

<p> My zenfone 3 has hang up problem and ghost touch. What would I do? </p>
<p> We hope that you’re covered with warranty since your best bet is to turn to some repair service. ”Ghost touch” is a well-known issue and it’s, sadly, hardware-related. </p>
<p> I just bought it last Monday. Will they give a new phone or have some repair on it? </p>
<p> Always ask for a brand new device, if possible. Repairs can be lengthy. And they are in debt to provide you with the functional device. </p>

<p> Hi, im having problem with my asus z3 speaker. It produce bad quality sound and more like a crackling sound when i turn music or video. But when i test it on single test speaker it was fine. And when i turn my phone to safe mode it was also fine. What went wrong? Was it because one of the application that i downloaded or was it because of something else? Thx </p>
<p> It may be related to some software you’ve installed. We can’t assure you, but the wipe of the cache partition should resolve app-inflicted issues. You’re welcome, we hope that this will resolve your issue, </p>

<p> Hi, after the updates, i am having problem with charging my zenfone max 3. before the battery will be fully charge within 2-3hrs, now, it took 7-8 hrs before it will be fully charge. And when I plug in the charger, you need to adjust the wire or charge socket of the phone before it will charge. My zenfone is 6 months old only </p>
<p> Since your device is not even remotely old enough for you to have battery issues, it’s certainly an update/software issue. Have you tried to wipe cache partition or to restore factory settings? </p>
<p> same issue here before it only took 2-3 hrs for a full charge now it indicates 7-8 hrs. idk if this has something to do with the cord or adaptor. phone is only 5 months zenfone 3 max. A little help would be appreciated here. thanks. </p>
<p> Have you tried the alternative cord? It’s quite hard for cord or adaptor to get faulty. Most of the time, the problem is with the phone, or to be more exact – battery. Was there any update that possibly triggered this battery issue? </p>
<p> I’ve encountered the same issue before what I did is I changed the cord, btw my zenfone 3 max is 4 month old. Hope this help </p>

<p> Huawei Honor 8 most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei has gained a lot of popularity lately with both Mate (flagship) and Honor (mid-range) series. Honor 8 is the latest addition to the list of mid-budget devices produced by the Chinese company. Upon presentation for the US and EU market, the phone received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, even though Honor 8 offers good performance for an affordable price, there are some common issues worth mentioning. Users reported various problems with both hardware and software. It seems that the producer addressed some of the problems, but there is a large number of those that they need to resolve. Today we listed for you the known issues and possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Video crash while playing </p>
<p> As some of the users stated, the Honor 8 have a lot of issues with the video playback or streaming. It seems that the video crashes and, on some occasion, a restart is the only solution to get things work again. According to them, the crash occurs in online or offline videos, regardless. On the other hand, the fundament of the problem is YouTube. </p>
<p> We have noticed that the problem is widespread and the main culprit is integration with third-party apps. For the standard videos, first and foremost is to check the format. Honor 8 supports these video formats: </p>
<p> WMV </p>
<p> RM </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the online streaming videos are the ones with issues, make sure that you reinstall the given app or try an alternative. It seems that the Honor 8 have a certain level off incompatibility with some of them. Additionally, if the problem is persistent, you should contact customers support and ask for a replace. </p>
<p> Video recording stutter in third-party apps </p>
<p> While this is not as crushing (no pun intended) as the previous issue, it can be as annoying. Namely, many users reported lag and stutter while recording videos on Snapchat or Instagram story. This often leads to unsynchronized audio and video. </p>
<p> This seems to be related to awkward camera overheating. You should check the top of your phone for temperature changes. If the phone’s temperature is normal, try restarting your phone and clearing the app cache and data. Moreover, you can check your battery temperature by typing this code in your dialer *#*#2846579#*#*. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the phone is overheated (and that seems to happen often with some users), you’ll have to let it cool down. The camera behavior is not a strong feature of this model since the following default software is underwhelming. We’ll have to wait and see are there any fixes prepared in the next update build. </p>
<p> 3G works instead LTE, WiFI won’t connect </p>
<p> Connectivity is a common issue with the Honor 8. A large number of users reported problems related both to Wi-Fi and data networks. The phone won’t connect to a known network for ages or it chooses 3G instead of much faster LTE. </p>
<p> You can try following workarounds for data network issue: </p>
<p> Switch Network type: Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings: Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and reestablish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> The Huawei confirmed that they are aware of the Wi-Fi issue. We can hope that they’ll fix it with the next patch. </p>
<p> Echo while calling </p>
<p> Some users reported a problem with in-call speaker and mic malfunction. According to them, they hear the echo while speaking on the phone. The issue is more present when the loudspeaker is ON. </p>
<p> This is a common issue with many Android-powered phones. Most of the time it is related to pre-installed Google app called TalkBack. Our advice is to turn it off. </p>
<p> No battery percentage was shown </p>
<p> Honor 8 isn’t presenting battery percentage on the home screen by default. Most of the users are accustomed to that feature and they want to enable it but don’t know how. And this is the simplest way: </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon. </p>
<p> In the upper right corner, you’ll see 3 icons. </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon that is in the middle. </p>
<p> Notifications are not displayed when screen is off </p>
<p> Some of the users were left in disbelief when their push notifications from various apps stopped. It can be a quite annoying experience that ruins all-around impression about the phone. Which is pretty great in all manners. </p>
<p> Huawei made a strange decision to improve battery life by completely disabling the notifications while the screen is off. Luckily, that can be changed in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Protected apps. </p>
<p> Add apps that you want to receive notifications from. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this article helpful. Additionally, we are sure that the phone will function much better once it gets updated to Nougat 7.0. The update cycle started on 10th February so be sure to check your phones. </p>

<p> recently my Honor8 isn’t receiving texts. I can send them just fine, but even after restarting the phone, clearing the cache, and forcing the app to quit it won’t receive any. </p>

<p> I cannot get my music working on Huawei Honor 8 Google play music works ok. Also can I set a song a on google play music as Ringtone? </p>
<p> I don’t think you can. Only the track from your storage can be set as a ringtone. </p>

<p> When I try to delete my emails from the recycle folder in my hot mail account they just reappear. Any ideas how I can delete them? </p>
<p> Have you tried to delete the account and re-establish it again? That’s a common bug. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy A70 common problems and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung has firmly re-entered the midrange segment this year. Users already love the company’s budget champion, the Galaxy A50, and its bigger brother, the A70, only improves on an already strong base. </p>
<p> Sure, the A70 might not be the best value for money in the whole A series, but it offers something authentic. It brings a good portion of the Galaxy Note experience with its huge AMOLED display. Only for the chunk of the price. If you value big phones, but don’t want to spend a small fortune, the Galaxy A70 is a way to go. You probably think the same way, and that’s why you just bought this device. </p>
<p> But then, the first problems start to appear. And there aren’t too many things as annoying as problems on a phone fresh out of the box. That’s why I compiled a list of the most common problems with the Galaxy A70 for you. Just find the issue that’s bothering you, and you’ll either find a solution, or understand the problem better. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Touch screen issues </p>
<p> When the phone’s highlight feature is its display, the last thing you’d want or expect is some screen-related problem. Unfortunately, that appears to be exactly the biggest problem with the A70. Forums are flooded with reports complaining about touch screen issues, of whom the biggest problem appears to be the multi-touch. </p>
<p> Apparently, users are having multi-touch issues in games that use the movement stick, like PUBG. Namely, when you drag the stick to keep moving, it stops registering your finger, so you have to lift it and press the stick again. </p>
<p> I couldn’t find a solution to this problem anywhere. That means Samsung will probably address it in an update. However, there are reports about users already receiving an update that claims to fix the multi-touch issue, but it still persists. </p>
<p> I can only advise you to keep checking for new updates, and hope for the best. Hopefully, Samsung will deal with this problem once and for all in the future. </p>
<p> 2. Wi-Fi problems </p>
<p> One user has reported on Samsung forums that he’s unable to connect to his home Wi-Fi network. Other than that, Wi-Fi doesn’t appear to be the problem on the A70. Nevertheless, if you can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network, make sure everything’s okay with your router first. </p>
<p> If you can’t connect to any Wi-Fi network, try some of the solutions listed in this article. </p>
<p> 3. Overheating issue </p>
<p> Just like the reported Wi-Fi problem, overheating doesn’t appear to be a widespread problem with the Galaxy A70. However, it’s been reported, so I feel like I should include it, anyway. </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing overheating on your brand new Galaxy A70, try some of the following workarounds: </p>
<p> Disable background services, like Bluetooth, NFC, location, etc. </p>
<p> Lower the screen brightness. </p>
<p> Disable the always-on display. </p>
<p> Try a different case. </p>
<p> Install the latest updates. </p>
<p> 4. Fingerprint scanner not working </p>
<p> Another new feature the A series brings to the table is the in-display fingerprint scanner. And once again, the real-life results are great, to say the least. There are numerous reports on the forums about the A70’s fingerprint scanner either being slow or not working at all. </p>
<p> Sure, this is still a first-generation technology, and you shouldn’t expect it to work flawlessly 100% of the time. Plus, the fact that Samsung doesn’t use premium hardware in the A70 doesn’t help. But still, you want it to function to a degree where it’s at least usable. </p>
<p> Some users have reported that the fingerprint scanner started working normally after a few updates. On the other hand, some say the issue persists even on up-to-date devices. So, the only thing left for you, if you’re experiencing the fingerprint scanner issues, is to keep checking for updates and hope for the best. If the problem persists, consider replacing your phone at the store. </p>
<p> 5. Lags while gaming </p>
<p> A few reports suggest that users are expiriencing lags while gaming. Esentially, this is true, but it’s probably not a problem per se. This alleged lagging issue is actually CPU throtthling caused by a high temperature. In case you’re not familiar with the term, when your phone reaches a certain temperature, it automatically “throttles” the speed of both GPU and CPU to prevent overheating. That process is called “throttling”. </p>
<p> So, if you’ve been gaming for an extensive period of time, your phone will reach a certain temperature, and it will throttle the power of your hardware. Which means you’ll have less resources to work with, and your performance will suffer. Especially in more demanding games. </p>
<p> In that manner, if your game starts stuttering, just put your phone down for an hour, and let it cool off. You shouldn’t experience any more lagging problems afterwards. Additionally, this can also happen if your phone already overheats, like mentioned above. In that case, try some of the recommended solutions to prevent overheating. </p>
<p> That’s about it. As you can see, there aren’t too many things to worry about with the A70, which makes this phone a pretty sure bet. Sure, possible touch screen problems could get annoying but you’ll get used to it eventually. And who knows, maybe Samsung will resolve everything with a future update. </p>

<p> I had some issues as well and i called Samsung and had tech help. He had me make a reset on my phone. Not a factory reset. After i did that i had to set a few settings again no problem. Now this phone is working very well. I hope this helps you. They are there to help. </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram Videos Not Playing On Android </p>
<p> Instagram has become an integral part of the ever-growing social networks family. Besides standard photos, you’re also able to share short GIF-like videos. If the picture is worth 1000 words, the video must be worth a bit more, does it? </p>
<p> While Instagram rarely has stability issues, the video playback can get stuck from time to time. Additionally, that can lead to app crash or instability or nervous breakdowns. So, if you are experiencing video issues, you’ve come to the right spot. Let’s try and resolve this issue together and get those videos up and running. </p>
<p> Update Instagram app </p>
<p> The first step you should take is updating your Instagram app. Most of the time, the problem lies in outdated version. Because of that, make sure you have the latest version at any given time. The auto-update should do the job for you, but you can look up for updates manually, too. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Tap Menu. </p>
<p> Look up for Instagram in Update tab. </p>
<p> Choose to update. </p>
<p> Once it’s done, open Instagram and try playing videos. </p>
<p> In case the videos still won’t play, let’s try additional steps. </p>
<p> Clear Instagram app cache and data </p>
<p> As same as the most of the apps do, Instagram stores a lot of data on your phone. With particular settings, every picture or video you post can be preserved on the phone storage or SD card. Moreover, there’s a lot of cache files that may slow down the app gradually and impact video playback. </p>
<p> According to that, your next step should be clearing cache and data from the Instagram app. Follow these instructions to clear Data and Cache. </p>
<p> Clear Cache and Data. </p>
<p> Some users use specific apps for automatic clearing of cache. However, we advise you not to use them. Firstly, they take your storage space, and secondly, they tend to work in the background and slow down all-around performance. Simply put, that kind of apps are more disadvantage than a valid tool. </p>
<p> Reinstall Instagram </p>
<p> Sometimes the apps may stuck because of some kind of the corruption. Software sometimes has a mind of its own and the only viable solution is reinstallation. So, if you’ve tried previous steps and the videos still won’t load, try this out. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Most of the time, this should resolve your issue. Of course, if the software is an issue. However, sometimes the connection may play the main part in this Instagram wrongdoings. Move on to the next step to troubleshoot the connection. </p>
<p> Restart Wi-Fi router </p>
<p> Some users reported on various forums that the Instagram videos work on Wi-Fi but won’t work on mobile data and vice versa. So, the first step is to restart your Wi-Fi router. Turn it off, wait a minute or so, and then turn it on. </p>
<p> Additionally, you may want to update router firmware and change from 5 GHz band to 2.4 GHz. Even though the 5 GHz supports higher speeds, it’s signal isn’t as reliable as 2.4 GHz over distance. That, of course, is not an issue with dual-band routers. </p>
<p> Reset your Network settings </p>
<p> Once you’ve tweaked your router, let’s reset network settings on the phone. That should fix common connection bugs and let you start from the scratch. Have in mind that you’ll need to reestablish the settings again. </p>
<p> Choose Network Settings Reset. </p>
<p> Tap RESET SETTINGS. </p>
<p> Turn off Power-saving mode </p>
<p> Thanks to one of our readers, we obtained another workaround that just may be the one that resolves the problem. He resolved the problem by disabling the Power-saving mode, that somehow interferes with the Instagram videos playback. So, navigate to Power settings, disable Power-saving mode and your problem should be sorted out. </p>
<p> Thanks a lot to Matt that suggested this solution. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. In case you have any additional problems with Instagram, please be free to tell us in the comments, or reach us out on Twitter. We’ll do our best to help you resolve them. </p>

<p> I have just moved to Android. I thought it was my connection or LET. But in this case it was the cache. So I have to do it constantly? If yes I already miss IOs </p>

<p> I was having this issue on my S8 but turning off power saving mode fixed it. I feel dumb because before you turn it on, it tells you all the things it’ll prevent lol. Thanks for this article! </p>
<p> ive tried all above and nothing works </p>
<p> If you have Galaxy s7/s8 turn off the power saving mode and everything will be okay. Because power saving mode limits background network usage, the videos won’t load. So if you turn on background network usage, it is also okay. </p>

<p> I finally got it to work. I got a galaxy note5 and for a past week been having the same problem as you all. I just got it to work. I went to the app settings and cleared data and cache then I manually gave permission to use your phone. Restarted the phone and after signing in again BOOM!!!! Instagram vids played tested and happy with results. Maybe the last update to android turned all permissions off? </p>

<p> I have the s8+ and videos will not work and also having bluetooth issues since the new update. Very frustrating! </p>
<p> Don’t put your device in the power saving mode or allow the app to use data in the parameter. </p>
<p> This issue was driving me crazy Turning off the automatic sound in Instagram settings fixed this issue Thanks </p>

<p> I signed into Instagram through Chrome. All my videos are working just fine. Since the problem only occurs with the Instagram app (updated and cache cleared), I am assuming the issue is between the app and my phone LGG4. It was great to see my videos working again. 🙂 </p>
<p> Hello folks! Thanks for the created topic! I tried all ways to turn the playback of the instagram videos but unfortunately nothing helped me.. The issue continues and it drives me nuts…. i am using htc one m9 cellphone and i have the problem for a loong time.. i tried to delete the cache, reinstall the app, reset the network settings and so on, but without any change. The videos are trying to load, i see at the top right corner the insta loading icon, but that’s it… please if you know any other ideas where would be the problem,… Read more » </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> Here’s why you can’t disable Adaptive Icons in Android Oreo </p>
<p> Android 8 Oreo is far from a revolutionary OS that brings your wildest fantasies about future tech to life. In fact, Google focuses on the back-end here. Most changes were made under the hood, so an average user coming from Android Nougat can barely see the difference. </p>
<p> That’s why users who care about their phones debate about some ‘less important’ features way more than they would if there were some game-changers involved. </p>
<p> A particular feature that people usually complain about is the Adaptive Icons. In fact, I’ve barely seen a positive review of this feature. This tells us one thing. Android Oreo users are divided into two groups – those who hate Adaptive Icons and those who simply don’t care enough to talk about them. </p>
<p> Since the second group probably won’t even bother to search for this article, it’s for all of you who have a feud with Adaptive Icons in Android Oreo. For all of you who are frustrated for being trapped with Adaptive Icons and don’t really get why it has to be that way. </p>
<p> We’ll discuss it all here. </p>
<p> Why are Adaptive Icons there in the first place? </p>
<p> Unlike iOS, where Apple pretty much controls the whole ecosystem, Android (being an open source OS) gives each member of its family more liberties. Individually, that’s a great thing. But it may not be beneficial for the greater good. </p>
<p> Developers have the freedom to polish every single aspect of their apps to smallest details. Both in terms of aesthetics and functionality. But we’ll focus on the aesthetics here. Subjectively looking, even though a single app’s icon looks great, it may not fit in with the rest of the icons, giving your home screen an awkward uniquely biased look. </p>
<p> These inconsistencies usually irritate people. In fact, people have been complaining about this since the earliest days of Android. And the fact that different phones all have their own custom ROM brings even more inequality. </p>
<p> So, Google decided to normalize things by trying to satisfy everyone’s taste. That’s how the idea of the Adaptive Icons was born. In theory, the whole plan looks legit and doable. But the result we got with Android Oreo speaks differently. </p>
<p> What are Adaptive Icons </p>
<p> The biggest misconception people have about Adaptive Icons is that it’s a launcher or appearance customization feature. That’s not true. Adaptive Icons is a system feature that should make third-party apps’ icons in-line with default icons provided by OEM. </p>
<p> I won’t dig into technical details too much here, so here’s how Google explainsAdaptive Icons: </p>
<p> “Android 8.0 (API level 26) introduces adaptive launcher icons, which can display a variety of shapes across different device models. For example, an adaptive launcher icon can display a circular shape on one OEM device, and display a squircle on another device. Each device OEM provides a mask, which the system then uses to render all adaptive icons with the same shape. Adaptive launcher icons are also used in shortcuts, the Settings app, sharing dialogs, and the overview screen.” </p>
<p> In order to follow Google’s rules of Adaptive Icons developers have to submit their icons in two layers, a transparent foreground layer and a solid background layer. As explained above, the launcher then cuts the layers into a shape specified by OEM. </p>
<p> As the OS uses an already provided mask to shape the icons automatically, there’s nothing you can do about it. Even though you’re not satisfied with the outcome. It’s just how the system works. </p>
<p> Now you know that as long as you’re using Android Oreo, Adaptive Icons will be there. You can’t simply erase them from your phone in any way. But, there’s a way to at least change the appearance of Adaptive Icons on your phone. </p>
<p> Obviously, this can’t be done using your stock launcher, but if you really can’t stand the current look of Adaptive Icons on your phone, there’s a third-party solution. </p>
<p> Use Nova Launcher </p>
<p> Nova Launcher is arguably the most popular third-party launcher for Android. Mostly because of its wealth of customization features. This includes the ability to change the shape of Adaptive Icons, which was introduced last year. </p>
<p> So, if you want to at least do something about your ugly adaptive icons, you can change their shape. I know it’s not what you’re looking for, but it gives you some customization freedom. Here’s how to change Adaptive Icons in Nova Launcher: </p>
<p> Open Nova Launcher Settings. </p>
<p> Go to Look & Feel > Adaptive Icons. </p>
<p> Choose the preffered shape of Adaptive Icons. </p>
<p> That’s about it. It is a bare minimum, but at least you’re able to adjust the icons to a more likable shape. That’s better than not being able to do anything about Adaptive Icons at all. </p>
<p> As it appears, Google still hasn’t solved the problem with unbiased icons on various Android phones. But we have another Android version ahead of us. As we still don’t know what will the new version bring, we can only hope Google will introduce a more viable solution for icons on your Home screen. Hopefully a better one. </p>
<p> What do you think about Adaptive Icons in Android Oreo and the way they function? Let us know in the comments below. </p>

<p> I don’t care if they add a “feature” like this long as I can TURN IT OFF. Options are good arbitrary decisions I have no say in are not. Like whoever decided “blind white” should be a color in every inch of the screen, on devices where white drains the most power. I don’t really care about the shape, it’s the SOLID WHITE that irritates. I bought a OnePlus specifically cause it’s menus are black, I’ve bought icon packs I like, and I’ve got a dark ecosystem (other than the damn notifications which turned to white from black two versions… Read more » </p>

<p> “That’s better than not being able to do anything about Adaptive Icons at all.” </p>
<p> No. No that’s not better that not being able to do anything, that is the same as not being able to do anything. I’m still stuck with the fucking migraine inducing white background, and no amount of shape changing will fix that. </p>

<p> Just got a new phone today. First thing I noticed is all my icons are shrunk with ugly white space around them. At first I thought it was a manufacturer mod. But reading this I find it’s Google fault. How disappointing. What were they thinking!? I can’t wait till it’s out of warranty and I can put a custom ROM on to get rid of this rubbish. </p>

<p> I originally switched to Nova Launcher because it was the only way to not waste real-estate on that stupid search bar. That’s no longer true, but Nova remains just a little better than the competition — with features like this one. Every time I get a new device, I experiment with the native launcher, but never see any reason to give up Nova. </p>

<p> White circles look like crap AND make it harder to quickly identify the icon you are looking for. My Color Notes icon was a simple yellow envelope that was easily noticed. Now I have to really look thru the stupid icons. DUMB MOVE </p>

<p> Why can’t they allow icons to have transparent backgrounds? Huge circles of whitespace all over my wallpaper, why bother, just make your background white. </p>

<p> I hate the fact I have to check all my settings after this update, many still now don’t work properly, and now I hate the fact I cannot change the shape of these dreadful icons, uniformity of which make it it hard to spot the one I want. Though my phone does give me options to BUY (equally horrid) styles from totally unknown sources. Is it possible to revert to previous version? </p>
<p> I just made the mistake of upgrading from Android 7 to 8 on a new phone and I’m really sorry I did, the new icons look ABSOLUTE SH-T. I want to factory reset because it looks so crap. How is it humanly possible that we’re creating such utter trash in 2018. I have been in the industry since the 90’s and already then we had some really beautiful UIs on other OS. We’re going backwards. </p>
<p> Don’t factory reset! You can live with ugly icons — and Orea is really, *really* much better. Support for third party password managers. Preventing poorly-written apps from draining your battery (I hope this works against Google News!). It even seems to have shrunk some of my more bloated apps. </p>

<p> When they’re uniform, I can’t easily distinguish between them. Shapes help differentiate between apps. I’m so happy I could enable legacy shapes. Yessssss! </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> My ASUS Zenphone stopped functioning since rainwater leaked into my phone pocket a week ago. My attempt to switch off failed, and, couldn’t force stop as well due to locked battery. Due to fluctuating charge of the wet battery, the initially display brightened abnormally and, finally, stopped. I kept the set dry 48 hours , then fully recharged. Again, there is no display at all. It vibrates while receiving calls, but I can’t receive the call because complete darkness on the screen. Kindly advise whether I can restore the display in my set again? </p>

<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> Why is it every time i update the software of my zenfone 3 max, the camera is getting worst? well the rare cam is okay but the front cam? the beautification is just so over, its like your using a app cam to beautify instead of the normal camera itself, it should be just so normal but it looks like your editing your photos. me as myself i dont really like filters or beautification apps, i like the normal one. </p>

<p> Alrigt here is my problem to my phone. When I Plugged in my charger, the problem here is that my phone is not charging, but the OTG works very well. I tried to shut down my phone, and then after that, It’s charging but, when the red light of my phone showns in the screen, It turns off and I did the same thing but still the same which means that it’s still not charging. And also I did the factory reset which is the best way to solve some problems but still not charging and the the OTG works… Read more » </p>
<p> Hi, I think the problem is in your charger not your phone. Try to charge your phone on other charger/cable. Or maybe you set your phone on energy saving apps which is whenever your phone reach its lower battery level it automatically shutdown. </p>

<p> Hi, need some help. I recently fix my old zenfone 5 (the first problem is automatic shutdown) I did a hard reset and factory reset and reformat my phone, this procedure fixes my first problem but then when my phone open and I tried to insert a sim (for cellular data purpose) the 2 sim isn’t available. I tried radio setting (run ping test) didn’t work either, I restart my phone so many times and re-insert my sim like what tutorials said. But the “unavailable” sim problem is still there. What else can I do to fix this error? Thank… Read more » </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> Hey! I have similar issues to most of the comments I’ve read. I bought mi Zenfone 3 Max 5.2 Inch two months ago and it suddenly started showing connectivity issues. The WiFi stops working even though it says it is still connected,and if I turn WiFi off and on again, it doesn’t connect; it says it has authentication issues and doesn’t connect anymore. Also when using my mobile data, only WhatsApp messaging works since I have unlimited WhatsApp connection, but any function other than messaging in WhatsApp or any other app doesn’t work, as if I had no data, but… Read more » </p>

<p> I have a ZE530KL which is stuck in a booting reset loop. I guessed it was power switch stuck on. Took to Asus service in Taiwan as it is under warranty. They refused to fix it. Said there was moisture inside which caused corrosion. The phone has never been in water. What should I do? </p>

<p> iOS 13.5.1 issues: Battery drain, Bluetooth problems, and more </p>
<p> Apple recently released the latest iOS 13.5.1 update. The update is available to users of all compatible iPhone Models. Unlike the previous update, this one doesn’t bring any new features but instead focuses on improving the overall security of the OS. </p>
<p> Although Apple’s update release notes aren’t very clear on what exactly the new update does, it does state that the update addresses the vulnerability exploited by the uncover jailbreak. With that being said, most jailbreakers would want to avoid this update. The rest of the users can comfortably install this release, and they won’t notice any difference in the way their iPhone works. </p>
<p> Or will they? </p>
<p> Although the new update brings zero new features, it actually causes some problems to users who installed it. Users are reporting battery drains, Bluetooth issues, connectivity problems, and more. </p>
<p> However, none of the problems seems to be widespread, as these are the individually reported cases. You have better chances of installing the update without any problems, than being stuck with an annoying issue. Nevertheless, I’m going to list some of the reported problems here, so you can see what could potentially go wrong. </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 battery drain </p>
<p> Reports about the battery drain caused by iOS 13.5.1 have been circulating on Twitter since the update’s release. Here’s one of the complaints: </p>
<p> @AppleSupport iphone battery draining like crazy after upgrading to iOS 13.5.1. What’s going on? Is there a fix?? </p>
<p> Right now, the solution to this problem is unknown. It appears that users experiencing the battery drain issue will have to wait for Apple to release a follow-up update. </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> Although reported by the smaller number of users, it appears that Bluetooth also doesn’t work for some people who installed iOS 13.5.1. </p>
<p> @Apple my phones Bluetooth just won’t connect to any device even though it’s turned on and discoverable? Any ideas </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 Face ID issues </p>
<p> Although iOS 13.5 improved Face ID to make it work with face masks, some people apparently have problems with it stretching to iOS 13.5.1. </p>
<p> @AppleSupport Why my face id isn’t working? I just updated to ios 13.5.1 and now it’s keep telling me that face id is not available! Can you help me? </p>
<p> Other problems </p>
<p> Besides the above-mentioned issues that appear to be more common, there are also a few more problems, including a camera problem, weird charging (though this one wasn’t specified, so I can’t tell you whether it was indeed caused by iOS 13.5.1, and a SIM card issue where the phone shows SIM cards as invalid. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, there are no confirmed solutions to any of these problems. Apple support usually recommends generic solutions to particular problems, by I doubt any of those will be helpful. Users that were hit by the update will probably have to wait for a patch. </p>
<p> Have you experienced any issues after installing iOS 13.5.1? If so, feel free to share them with us in the comments below. </p>
<p> iPhone 8 shutting down randomly. Sometimes the battery says low like 11%. When I put it on charger and reset, the percentage immediately shows a much higher number well above 50% depending on where it was on failure I think. Battery charge does not appear to last as long either. </p>
<p> I’m having similar problems with my iPhone 8 and a friend with and iPhone 10 same issues. All started after installing iOS 13.5.1. See my detailed post dated June 25, 2020 for some specific info. </p>

<p> It wasn’t about fixing issues, it was about tracking your location at all times for the Fake Flu hence the battery drain. Someone at the Apple concentration camp let it slip and tried to backpedal. They have also been messing with taking your temperature when the phone is next to your ear then auto informing the “gestapo” if you have traveled “without your papers”. </p>

<p> My daughters IPAD pro apple pencil gen 2 won’t synch after the update last night. Tried everything. I have only seen issues reported and seen solutions with gen 1 pencil. Anyone else having this issue? She also noticed it won’t charge to 98% which was a solution for some gen 1 pencil synch issues. </p>

<p> It seems after the update the battery doesn’t charge from an external battery. It keeps cutting off the charge so the phone battery drains. </p>

<p> After installing IOS 13.5.1 I am experiencing storage issues. I have deleted at least 15 Apps and storage drops bt then starts climbing again to max out. I have an iPhone 6S Plus with 32 gb. No storage problems at all before upgrading. </p>

<p> I have iPhone XR, running iOS 13.5.1. Since downloading this update, my battery drain is horrible! My screen is also going dark; not green, even though I have Brightness turned up to around 78%. Is Apple working on, or ignoring the widely reported battery drain issue; if not, why??? This is a terrible update! Is there any way to uninstall the update, or are we stuck with it, and have to be tethered a charger all day? </p>

<p> Redmi Note 8 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Xiaomi doesn’t play around and the output of devices they introduce yearly is crazy for all industry standards. Not even 8 months after the Chinese giant introduced the Redmi Note 7 (and its variations, 7S and 7 Pro), the Redmi Note 8 (along with 8 Pro and 8T) have hit the market. </p>
<p> This appears to be a great device, just like its predecessor, with the Penta-camera (if we include the selfie cam) setup being the major upgrade over the Redmi Note 7. The device has its flaws but they are hard not to look over considering the price point of Note 8. </p>
<p> Today, we made sure to provide you with the list of the most common Redmi Note 8 issues with applicable solutions. If you have any problems with the device, continue reading below or just jump to a section of your interest. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Touchscreen is laggy </p>
<p> Some users reported that the touchscreen (display) is laggy and that was later identified as a software issue on the official global ROM. In our knowledge, the problem is dealt with on later updates. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, if the display is laggy or animations are slow, make sure to follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > My device > System and check for updates. Install an update if available. </p>
<p> Enable Developer options (Settings > My device > All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number). Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options and disable MIUI Optimization at the bottom. </p>
<p> Get back in Developer options and reduce Animation from 1 to 0.5. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings (the procedure is explained at the bottom of this article). </p>
<p> 2. Battery drain issues </p>
<p> Although the 4000 mAh battery should be big enough to give the Redmi Note 8 an exquisite Screen-on Time, users are reporting issues with battery drains. There are multiple things that might affect battery life but, when it comes to MIUI-powered devices, our first suspect is a lack of optimization on the current ROM. </p>
<p> Updates cause battery drains and new updates usually solve them. So, first of all, make sure that your Redmi Note 8 is up to date in regards to the firmware. After that, you can check these tips to reduce battery drains significantly: </p>
<p> Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Disable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and individually disable Autostart on apps. </p>
<p> Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery. </p>
<p> 3. SIM card won’t activate </p>
<p> Moving on, there are reports about the SIM card not working. Namely, it seems that the SIM card won’t activate on this handset for some European and Asian users. Now, we need you to ensure that your device is on the Global MIUI ROM where all necessary bands are available. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, try reinserting the SIM card into the alternative socket and try again. Make sure to reboot your device after doing so. If the problem is still persistent, update the firmware or reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> There’s a slight chance that we are looking at the manufacturing defect, so you can also contact your retailer for service. </p>
<p> 4. Notification icons not showing </p>
<p> Missing notifications on MIUI is probably the longest-running problem Xiaomi/Redmi users experienced. The fact that someone at their software development department decided that it’s a good idea for notification icons to disappear after a few seconds from the Status bar is preposterous. </p>
<p> Luckily, you don’t have to worry about that the moment MIUI gets available. Which already is, although based on Android 9 Pie instead of Android 10. </p>
<p> The problem with notifications is completely solved on MIUI 11, but if you are still not seeing notification icons, here’s how to enable them with ease: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open Display. </p>
<p> Select Notch & status bar. </p>
<p> Under the Status bar section, enable Show icons for incoming notifications. </p>
<p> 5. Low sound volume on headphones </p>
<p> This is also quite a common occurrence, especially on wireless (Bluetooth) headphones or buds. Users say that the volume on their headphones is not high at all, even on the highest settings. Seemingly, there is a workaround to it and we already wrote about it, here. </p>
<p> What you need to do is toggle on the Disable absolute volume option in the Developer options menu. </p>
<p> An alternative is to tweak audio output with certain Magisk modules, which requires root. We don’t recommend that approach if you are not experienced with modding ROMs. </p>
<p> 6. Google Assistant not working </p>
<p> Another quite common problem reported on various forums concerns Google Assistant that won’t work on the Redmi Note 8. The Voice Match for Google Assistant’s voice commands appears greyed out for some users. </p>
<p> This problem seems to be related to MIUI, both 10 and 11, and we don’t have any official response by Xiaomi. There are some things you can try in order to resolve this but, as we said already, this is a widespread issue and, until Xiaomi resolves the problem with their OS skin, we can mainly wait. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to try and solve Google Assistant not working on Redmi Note 8: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Google and clear cache and data. </p>
<p> Leave the Google Beta program from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Uninstall Google updates and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings > Apps > Manage apps. Tap on the 3-dot menu and open Default apps. From there, open Assist & voice input. Under the Assist app, select Google. </p>
<p> Delete and retrain the Voice model. </p>
<p> 7. The Call recording option is missing </p>
<p> This isn’t a bug or anything similar. Namely, due to rules in different regions and in accordance with Google’s privacy regulations (they paid a hefty fee for privacy infringement case), Xiaomi won’t deliver their Contacts and dialer app with an option to record calls. This option is not allowed in Europe and various other regions around the globe. </p>
<p> So, if you badly want this option, consider unlocking the bootloader and flashing either an official ROM from supported regions or flashing Xiaomi EU ROM that has it. </p>
<p> 8. Delay on Lock Screen </p>
<p> This can fall into the overall lag issues with the device but we decided to give it a separate spot on the list. Namely, some users have said that there’s an unexpected 4 seconds delay when they are on the Lock Screen and just after unlocking the device. </p>
<p> For the time being, we don’t have many insights to offer but you can try disabling Tap to wake and disabling the double-press Power button to start a camera. Alternatively, you should ensure that the firmware is up to date or reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 9. GCAM not working on Note 8 </p>
<p> One of the best things about the Redmi Note 8 is that it supports Google Camera ports without rooting your device. Although you won’t be able to utilize all lenses with GCAM, the standard mode photography along with the Night Mode are much better than on the stock camera app. </p>
<p> However, since the device is (still) new, users run into a lot of GCAM ports that crash or won’t work in certain mods. We recommend downloading the GCAM from an acknowledged developer, here. </p>
<p> Just make sure to, before you run the app for the first time, clear all cache and data. That will prevent crashes. </p>
<p> 10. Tips: How to wipe cache partition or factory reset Redmi Note 8 </p>
<p> Finally, we made sure to provide you with two valuable procedures that, if things go awry, might help you get your device in the working condition again. </p>
<p> Here’s how to wipe cache partition on Redmi Note 8 and solve certain issues: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> And this is how to reset your device to factory settings: </p>
<p> Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> Additionally, if you dislike bloatware that comes with MIUI, we have just the right article for you. Learn how to easily debloat your Redmi Note 8 with the steps explained here. No unlocking bootloader or root needed. </p>
<p> With that side note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and we hope this piece shed some light on issues you experienced. If you have additional problems that we forgot to post or any questions concerning Redmi Note 8 issues, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. </p>
<p> I had been using the Redmi Note 8 pro for the last few months and have recently noticed some issues. The link to see these problems is attached below. The first issue is the touch issue on Redmi Note 8 Pro, which I had noticed quite unexpectedly. Redmi Note 8 Pro display is sometimes unresponsive along the edges of the screen. I had thought that this touch problem would be a bug or defect on my device, but came to know that a lot of people have experienced this too. This might be due to the cheap quality touch digitalizer… Read more » </p>

<p> Hi had my note 8 from march and from day one keeps random rebooting multiple times a day. Always when left not whilst being used . It is on the latest version M 11. There are sometimes it will go for a week and no rebooting but then starts again. Occasionally it just shuts off completely. Apart from this annoying fault it works fine and love it. Has anybody found a fix for the rebooting issue ? Many thanks in advance. </p>
<p> Hello hope you fine. My note 8 pro auto rotation option & raise to walk not working. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 common problems and how to fix them </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 is an exceptional budget device. It packs a solid set of specs and build quality, which makes it quite appealing to buyers in its price range. </p>
<p> A friend of mine recently got this device, and he’s very content with it. It easily gets him through the day with the 4000 mAh battery, and it’s also a smooth ride, thanks to 6GB of RAM and the Snapdragon 660. </p>
<p> However, just like any other phone (including much pricier models), the Redmi Note 7 has its own minor issues. Most of them happen in individual cases, but they’re still issues. So, if you recently encountered a problem with your brand new Redmi Note 7, I hope you’ll find a solution in this article. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching it, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1: Touch too sensitive </p>
<p> The first thing you’ll probably notice when using the Note 7 for the first time is that its display is probably more sensitive than what you’re used to. This is not a bug per se, it’s just how the display was made. </p>
<p> So, there’s really nothing you can do about it, because there’s no way to adjust the sensitivity with software. You can actually try a different screen protector, but I’m not sure how much it will help. </p>
<p> 2: GPS problem </p>
<p> Reportedly, GPS malfunction is a widespread problem on the Note 7. Apps like Google Maps or Waze fail to establish a connection with the GPS service, which basically renders them unusable. </p>
<p> Luckily, you’re not powerless when it comes to solving this problem. The first solution I have in mind is simply keeping your MIUI version up to date. Xiaomi will eventually release a fix (if it already hasn’t), and the problems should vanish. </p>
<p> But if the problem persists, even with the latest MIUI version installed on your phone, there’s an additional step I found on the MIUI forum you could try. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Dual Apps. </p>
<p> Turn on Google services. </p>
<p> Toggle on the apps you have problems with (Uber, Waze, etc.) </p>
<p> Tap the Battery icon. </p>
<p> Tap Go to Settings under App Battery Saver. </p>
<p> Click Google Maps/Waze/etc. </p>
<p> The ‘dual version’ of the select app will appear on your Home Screen. Use this version until Xiaomi fixes the GPS problem with an update. </p>
<p> Keep in mind this method only works with third-party apps like Uber or Waze. Meaning you can’t use Dual Apps to make GPS working in Google apps like Google Maps. For these apps, you’ll have to wait for Xiaomi to release an update. </p>
<p> 3: Battery drains </p>
<p> On paper, the Redmi Note 7 boasts a great battery capacity, that’s at the very top of its class. But when it comes to real life usage, the battery life is, well, also great. For some users. The others, less fortunate ones, have to deal with a strange drain that drastically shortens the battery life. </p>
<p> As it’s usually the case with battery drains on a new phone, the cause is unknown. It could be a software problem caused by a recent update, or the issue might be on your end. </p>
<p> According to the forums, it’s probably not your fault, as your current MIUI version drains more battery than it should. You guessed it, the solution is to wait for an update that will (hopefully) improve the battery life. </p>
<p> While you’re waiting for that rescuing update, here are a few things you can try to improve the battery life: </p>
<p> Uninstall battery consuming apps. Check the battery usage per app by going to Settings > Battery & performance > Power usage. </p>
<p> Turn off system animations: Settings > Additional settings > Accessibility > Remove animations. </p>
<p> Restrict background app processes: Settings > Additional settings > Developer options > Background process limit > reduce the number of background processes. </p>
<p> Disable automatic brightness: Settings > Display > Brightness level > disable automatic brightness and adjust it manually. </p>
<p> 4: Background apps closing </p>
<p> As much as the previous solutions are helpful for extending the battery life on your Note 7, they also require compromises. Because you simply cannot have one thing without sacrificing another. Xiaomi knows this, so the company actually made some efforts to automatize that “sacrificing process” and make power management easier for users. That’s how a feature called MIUI optimization was introduced. </p>
<p> This feature automatically restricts certain processes on your phone, in order to extend the battery life while eliminating the need for any tweaks on users’ end. Sure, MIUI Optimization improves power management, but compromises are sometimes too big for users to bear with. </p>
<p> In the Note 7’s case, the MIUI optimization feature seems to automatically close the apps running in the background. Usually, that shouldn’t bother you, but if the apps you regularly use are being constantly closed, you’d probably want this to stop happening. </p>
<p> The obvious solution for this is to disable the MIUI Optimization feature. Yes, disabling it will slightly shrink the battery life, but you probably won’t even notice the difference. What makes the case for disabling this feature even stronger are reports of MIUI Optimization interfering with some non-MIUI based apps, eventually causing even more problems, as mentioned in this forum post. </p>
<p> To disable MIUI Optimization, you need to have Developer options enabled first. To enable Developer options, go to Settings > About Phone > tap the MIUI version 7 times, until the message saying “You’re now a developer!” appears. </p>
<p> Now that we have access to Developer options, here’s how to disable MIUI Optimization: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Additional settings > Developer options. </p>
<p> Find MIUI Optimization, and disable it. </p>
<p> 5: Face unlock not working </p>
<p> This one is as old as the face unlocking technology in Xiaomi phones. And the answer to the question “why can’t I use the Face unlock feature on my brand new Xiaomi phone” is always the same. It’s not available in your region! </p>
<p> Face unlock is restricted in most areas of the world. Some regions will get this feature with future system updates, some won’t. So, if you’re in an unsupported region, but still want to be able to unlock your phone with your face, the only solution is to switch to a supported region. </p>
<p> Your best bet, in this case, is Hong Kong, since the Face Unlock on the Redmi Note 7 is confirmed to work in this region. To change your phone’s region, go to Settings > Additional Settings > Region, and set it to Hong Kong. </p>
<p> 6: Notifications not showing </p>
<p> And finally, a problem that’s common to many Xiaomi phones. You probably find it very annoying that notifications only briefly show in the bar next to the clock, and the immediately disappear. </p>
<p> This wouldn’t even make it to the list of problems if the Note 7 had a huge notch. There simply wouldn’t be enough space for additional icons. But since the Note 7 features a teardrop notch, there’s plenty of space left for notifications. </p>
<p> Apparently, the current version of MIUI (10.3.6 at the time of writing) isn’t well optimized for different notch sizes. So, the pattern stays the same, regardless of whether your phone has a gigantic notch, or just a teardrop. </p>
<p> There are rumors MIUI 11 will fix this inconvenience. So, the only thing left for you is to bear with disappearing icons, and hope the next system version (expected in a month or two) will deal with this. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I certainly hope this article helped you resolve (or at least better understand) your problems with the Note 7. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, just write them down in the comments below. </p>

<p> How to fix Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 microphone issues </p>
<p> Xiaomi is taking over. The Chinese manufacturer has been producing some great mid-budget handheld devices and receives critical acclaim from both professionals and customers. Additionally, MIUI, the Android-based OS, works as good as you would expect. </p>
<p> However, same as Android, it has its known issues. One of the most reported issues is related to the microphone. Or better, mics. That goes for multiple Xiaomi models, but today we’ll try to address the most popular one. </p>
<p> Of course, we are talking about the Redmi Note 3. This specific device packs two microphones. In theory, they should improve sound but it seems that is not the case always. Somehow they occasionally provoke low sound quality, both in-call and while recording. Nonetheless, there are a few solutions available for this issue. We collected most useful ones, with the hope to help you overcome this problem. </p>
<p> Disable Google Now </p>
<p> Xiaomi’s MIUI stands shoulder to shoulder with the Android operating system. For global market, they offer a quite clean system without excessive bloatware. Also, they implemented a lot of Android features. However, implementing and optimizing those features are two things apart. Google Assistant (Google Now) is a known culprit for the mic issues and you should disable it. </p>
<p> Tap Search & Now. </p>
<p> Choose Voice. </p>
<p> Tap OK Google detection. </p>
<p> Have in mind that this is just a temporary solution and that it should be permanently resolved with future updates. Then you can use your smart assistant in a seamless fashion. </p>
<p> Update your Firmware </p>
<p> Behind MIUI we have a group of knowledgeable enthusiasts and technicians that work hard for top results. Some of the better-known companies have to look up to this guys. However, for better or worse, updates are not functioning the same way as on Android. You’ll need to download ROM and upgrade with it, rather than download and install updates directly from update servers. Moreover, this way you’ll need to backup your data since everything from the internal memory will be wiped out. </p>
<p> Select the ROM you’ve transferred from PC. </p>
<p> The upgrade should start and you’ll be prompted to confirm. </p>
<p> After the process is finished, start your device and test the microphone. </p>
<p> Use SoundAbout app to configure the mic </p>
<p> One of the temporary solutions is Sound About app from the Play Store. With this app, you can configure speakers and microphones. Additionally, and that is related to this problem, you can disable secondary microphone and therefore temporary improve the in-call sound quality. </p>
<p> Those were our solutions. As we already stated, they are just temporary workarounds until the developers fix the code. In case you have any questions or remarks, do tell us in the comments section. Or reach us out on Twitter. We look forward to helping you. </p>
<p> 47 COMMENTS </p>
<p> This model has another big problem. The mic in loud environment… If you try to record a Video or record a voice message you will notice the sound is useless like this video: https://youtu.be/2J02u1-cYrU Other brands works great in the same condition. No solution from Xiaomi and was reported more than a year, will try with the SoundAbout aplication. </p>

<p> These suggestions didn’t help. I have to make all my phone calls with the speaker on or the caller doesn’t hear anything. This started after installing the last update. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy J3 most common issues and how to resolve them </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy J3 is more than a viable option in the lower low-budget category. If you’re not exceptionally demanding user and a loyal fan of Samsung handsets, J3 is well-suited for the job. However, for this and the majority of handsets, there are always issues that need to be addressed. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we prepared a list of most frequently reported problems provided by J3 users. Of course, we provided you with the proper troubleshooting steps, so make sure to check for your individual problem. We hope that you’ll find the remedy for your ache in the list below. </p>
<p> Battery issues </p>
<p> First, the main reason why people seem to deem the overall usability of this handset lackluster is the battery. The battery on J3 isn’t bad per se, and it certainly won the battle with the competition in 2016. Nonetheless, it’s the software within the device that drains the battery. So, even though the 2600 mAh battery is well-performing, there are still ways to improve the battery life and reduce the consumption. For that purpose, we enlisted some of those workarounds below: </p>
<p> Disable background apps. You can either do it manually within Settings > Application manager or by using the Smart Manager (Device Maintainance). Navigate to Settings > Device Maintainance > Unmonitored apps, and clear apps that are using the battery extensively while working in the background. </p>
<p> Use Battery Power Saving mode. Tap Settings > Device Maintainance > Battery and use one of two battery saving modes. </p>
<p> Disable GPS. You can either disable GPS permanently until an app acquires it or reduce the accuracy of the location service by changing location method to Phone only. Tap Settings > Connections > Enable Location > Location method, and switch to Phone only. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> In addition, make sure to uninstall the redundant and unused apps that are hogging on your device resources. We hope that with those, you’ll be able to extend your battery’s life. </p>
<p> Overheating issues </p>
<p> Overheating isn’t exactly a common problem, but it does affect certain users. And once it occurs, it’s likely to make your overall experience with the J3 quite hard to cope with. Moreover, if the phone is overheating over extended periods, you may encounter more than lags and stutters. Namely, in the worst case scenario, you can expect hardware failure. Obviously, it’s essential to address the overheating issue before it’s too late. </p>
<p> There are various reasons for this occurrence, and we advise you to check the following steps in order to prevent them: </p>
<p> Don’t use your phone while charging. </p>
<p> Check the resource hogging apps in the background. </p>
<p> Make sure that your battery isn’t faulty. </p>
<p> Remove the casing. </p>
<p> Don’t expose your handset to heat sources over an extended period of times. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Connectivity issues are generally not unusual for a multitude of Android handsets. Some of them suffer from the lackluster signal, while others are known for connection crashes. Either way, it’s hard to use your device as intended without the proper Wi-Fi connection. Almost impossible. Samsung Galaxy J3 isn’t exactly known for Wi-Fi issues, but some isolated cases are still enough for us to address the issue. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to follow the instructions below in order to troubleshoot Wi-Fi issues on your J3: </p>
<p> Forget Network and connect again. </p>
<p> Press and hold on Wi-Fi icon in the Notification panel to open Wi-Fi settings. </p>
<p> Use 5 GHz instead of 2.4 GHz and vice versa. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Turn off the device. Make sure that your battery is not critically low. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Up key + Home key + Power button. </p>
<p> Once the logo appears on the screen, release the Power button while holding the Volume Up key + Home key. </p>
<p> Wait for the Android logo to appear and release all buttons. </p>
<p> Use the Volume Down key to find and highlight the ‘wipe cache partition’ option. </p>
<p> Use the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Now, scroll down with the Volume Down key and highlight ”Yes”. </p>
<p> Mobile data issues </p>
<p> As same as with the Wi-Fi, some users experienced issues with the Mobile Data. Some of them weren’t able to use the 3G/4G as intended due to SIM card issues, while others encountered issues with unexpected signal drops and similar irregularities. Most of the time, the issue is closely related to an inappropriate position of the SIM card. Cellular signal drops are the best way to find out is your SIM card properly inserted in the SIM tray. </p>
<p> On the other hand, there are also some software issues that need to be examined, since the problem isn’t exclusively connected to the SIM card. Follow the instructions below to troubleshoot the mobile data issues on your Samsung Galaxy J3: </p>
<p> Reset your device. </p>
<p> Switch Network type. Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> TurnAirplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. Go to Settings > Connections> Mobile Networks > Tap Access Point Names > More > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> With that, you should be able to use the mobile data just like before. </p>
<p> SD card issues </p>
<p> SD card is of utmost importance if you want to store more multimedia since the device is limited to 16 GB of internal storage. However, users reported issues with SD cards, too. Namely, some of them weren’t able to transfer the data from internal storage to SD. Other – well – their J3 wouldn’t even recognize the SD card or suddenly unmounts it. For that purpose, we advise you to follow the steps below, since there are multiple ways to address this issue. </p>
<p> Power Off your device and remove SD card from the slot. Clean the slot with the compressed air and re-insert the SD card. </p>
<p> Backup your SD card on your PC and format it. Make sure to format or reformat the SD card and copy the backed-up content again. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Unexpected shutdown issues </p>
<p> If we take into consideration all enlisted issues of J3, this is probably the most intimidating one. Some users pointed out the major issue with regard to sudden restarts or even shutdowns. There are few reasons for this occurrence and we’re presenting them below: </p>
<p> The phone is overheating. </p>
<p> Custom ROM causes issues with the hardware. </p>
<p> Hardware failure. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to look at presented solutions for overheating issue and flash your device again. In addition, you can try to boot into the safe mode and examine the behavior. If the phone is working as intended, make sure to delete all lately installed apps. In contrary, if the device is still failing, it’s likely that we’re looking at hardware malfunction. So make sure to take your Samsung Galaxy J3 for repairs. </p>
<p> SIM card issues </p>
<p> You would imagine that this is a problem similar to the one with the SD card. Symptoms are obviously different, but the reason is, most of the time, inappropriate placement. On the other hand, with the latest updates, users with SIM card issues (sudden loss of network signal, mobile data loss, and ”Please insert SIM card” error) are rightfully suspecting the software involvement, as well. For that purpose, we prepared a list of possible solutions you should take into consideration: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Reinsert SIM card and/or switch SIM 1 and SIM 2 positions if you’re using dual-SIM option. </p>
<p> Try your SIM card in another handset to make sure it’s working. </p>
<p> Select ”3G only”. Navigate to Settings > Connections > Mobile Networks > Network Mode, and choose ”3G only” from the dropdown list. </p>
<p> Select proper access point. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth temporarily. </p>
<p> Boot in the safe mode and look for changes in the signal behavior. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> In the plethora of reported issues, it wouldn’t be fair to skip on Bluetooth issues. Bluetooth-related issues that are reported, mostly refer to failed pairing or unstable connection with the paired device. This mostly occurs in a pairing J3 with the car board. Or lack of it, to be exact. Luckily, if we exclude the hardware failure of the Bluetooth radio, there are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this problem. </p>
<p> Disable other network services while using Bluetooth (Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G). </p>
<p> ”Forget” device and try to pair again. </p>
<p> Wipe partition cache (process explained above). </p>
<p> That should do it. If you have alternative issues or solutions for the problems we presented above, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. We’ll be glad to help you. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Poor performance of Oreo on J3 2017, very slow, with all apps closed. Poor poor performance, reverting to factory defaults. Phone freezes without doing anything with all network connections off, wi fi off, etc. Remains freezed until reboot, etc…many issues. Do not upgrade on J3. Overheats in excess. Fix it Samsung… </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy S6 Nougat issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> For a lot of Android users around the globe lies the dilemma: older flagship or brand new mid-budget. If you ask us, we are cheering on the side of the older flagship devices. </p>
<p> For example, Samsung Galaxy S6. Amazing device, great design, sleek but occasionally erratic TouchWiz, stunning camera. What more you would expect from an Android smartphone? Well, lack of the timely and functioning software updates may come in question, but only because that’s a general problem with Samsung and not an individual handset issue. </p>
<p> So, recently, users of S6 received the Nougat via OTA update. And then the hell broke loose. Many of them reported a lot of issues and today we provided a list of most common issues and possible workarounds for each individual reported the problem. If you have a hard time with your S6 after an update, make sure to check the list below. </p>
<p> Call issues </p>
<p> We had to start with the essential feature that some users reported as broken. Well, imagine that you own an amazing feature-rich device but, there’s a little negligible problem: you can’t answer your calls. That happened to some users. The phone is ringing but nothing is shown on the screen. This is how one user explained the problem: </p>
<p> ”Since the Android update yesterday I go through periods where I cannot answer incoming calls. The phone rings but there is no indicator that there is an incoming call and icons or anything to even answer the incoming call. How do I correct this? I can restart my phone and I can answer incoming calls for a brief period then it start all over again where I can’t answer them. I have changed nothing on my phone. The only thing that has happened was the Android upgrade” </p>
<p> There’s an alternative, but the only permanent solution is a factory reset. At least, if you want to answer to your calls like you used to before the Nougat update. For an alternative solution, you can navigate to Settings > Accessibility > Answering and end calls > and enable “Answer calls by pressing the home key”. </p>
<p> However, you can perform a factory reset and have a good chance of resolving this issue. This is how to do it: </p>
<p> Backup your data and make sure that the phone’s battery is at least on 30%. </p>
<p> Open Backup & restore. </p>
<p> Tap Reset device. </p>
<p> Tap Erase everything. </p>
<p> Your device will restart and you should be able to answer calls just like before an update. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Even the fundamental connectivity was struck down for some users. Namely, some of them reported that they were unable to connect to both home or public networks after the update. One user offered a concise description of the problem at hand: </p>
<p> ”Got the new Android upday today (I have an S6) and tonight I couldn’t connect to a public Wi-Fi network. How do i fix this? I had no issues connecting before the update.” </p>
<p> These are some steps you should take in order to address the Wi-Fi issues: </p>
<p> Restart the router. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, make sure to address the issue to your carrier support center. </p>
<p> Camera issues </p>
<p> It seems that some of the native camera features are gone with the latest update. Allegedly, after the update, some users lost filters that were available on the previous Android version. This is how one user described his/her concerns regarding the subject: </p>
<p> ”I’ve only had my phone running for a day with the latest update, but the grayscale camera filter seems to be MIA and the low light resolution is sub par now. I always found the grayscale filter to give better photos in low light, so even though I can edit a color photo to make it grey…it’s not at all the same. I don’t see grayscale as an option for a filter to download, but has anyone else run into this and found a solution?” </p>
<p> As you would imagine, there isn’t a practical workaround for this. However, you can use an alternative app before the next system update to utilize your camera’s full potential with all the needed features. </p>
<p> Buttons/keys issues </p>
<p> Another key feature (no pun intended) is broken for some users. Namely, the Power and Home keys are unresponsive for some users periodically after the update rollout. This is how one S6 owner explained his problem and the way her/he resolved it: </p>
<p> ”After the Nougat update my power button intermittently stopped working, i.e. unable to turn screen on or if it is on, turn it off. Holding it down does nothing. After charging it for a bit, the problem seemed to go away. It was over 60% charged when I noticed the problem. Similarly, the home button either did nothing or opened Google assistant (did not hold the button, simply tapped it). I powered off and on. I cleared the cache. Yet the problem still persisted. For NOW, it seems to have returned to working normally. Only thing I did was let it charge for about 30 minutes during a car ride. There is something unstable in the code.’‘ </p>
<p> As you can see, this issue is somehow resolved by charging. On the other hand, if this strange occurrence is still there after a while, you should perform the factory reset. </p>
<p> Battery issues </p>
<p> Battery drains aren’t exactly a novelty for Samsung updates. After the S7 and S7 Edge battery issues, the battery life is substantially decreased on S6, as well. One user shared a thorough explanation behind this issue: </p>
<p> ”I’ve had my Samsung Galaxy S6 for around 16 months now. It seems like over the past 3-4 months the battery life has gotten worse, I’ve experienced a weird problem a few times too. Today, I was surprised look at my phone and see that the battery life was much lower than it should have been, since I had not been using my phone, it had just been in my pocket. Looking at the battery life chart in settings confirmed that there was a sudden drop in battery life a couple hours ago.” </p>
<p> As you can see for yourself, sudden drops of battery percentage are not uncommon after the update. However, you can perform a few tweaks to improve your battery life and those can be found in this article. </p>
<p> Wireless charging issues </p>
<p> Wireless charging is also impacted by the update. Some users reported that they’re unable to charge their devices with wireless chargers as soon as the system updated. One user summarized the problem this way: </p>
<p> ”Is anyone else having a problem with wireless charging after Nougat update? I keep my wireless charger on my desk at work. I did my update and then left. Came in the next day and the wireless isnt charging. Its not the charger because someone with an S7 and S8 have both tested it and they can charge on it. Any one else having this problem ?” </p>
<p> If you’re certain that the wireless charger is functional, you can wipe the cache partition and, if that’s not of any use, restore the factory settings. </p>
<p> Reboot/boot loop issues </p>
<p> Now, this is a dealbreaker for most of the users. Once they’ve installed the Nougat update, their respective devices get stuck on the welcome screen or the random resets started. One user presented the problem he has to cope with after the update: </p>
<p> ”Hi, I tried to update my firmware with the new Nougat upgrade last night. When I retrieved my phone this morning, it was frozen on the Verizon screen. I tried all of the tricks: rebooting the system, rebooting to bootloader, wiping the cache partition, and even doing a hard factory reset. Nothing has worked – not even the factory reset! It still freezes on the Verizon screen. Any advice for a self fix before I take it to a repair shop? Thanks!” </p>
<p> It seems that there’s no solution at the moment, at least not the one that can be performed by users themselves. So, if you’ve experienced similar issues, make sure to take your device to a service center. </p>
<p> Voicemail issues </p>
<p> This issue is not as much connected to a voicemail as it is an interface bug that causes the message playback to stop after the phone is close to your ear. It seems that the sensor bug affects the voicemail playback. Here is the description of the problem provided by one user: </p>
<p> ”I have visual voicemail and anytime I hit play and then put the phone to my ear to listen to the message the message pauses. The only way for me to listen to the voicemail is to put it on speaker phone. Anybody know a fix to this?” </p>
<p> Until now, the 3 workarounds proven as the best-suited for the job. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Voicemail app > Force stop, and restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable all lock screen security measures (pattern, PIN, password). </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> But, for most of the users, the problem is still there. So, we should expect some fixes in the upcoming app and system versions. </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> At the end, it’s important to say that some of these may be the isolated cases and the Nougat update work’s as intended on your Samsung handset. However, there’s also a possibility that we missed some of the issues, so you’re welcome to share them in the comments section. </p>
<p> Either way, we certainly hope that the Samsung and the carriers will work their way out of this in the next update that’s at the moment in the beta stage. </p>
<p> Hi There, I’m having issues with game apps. I play games like Cookie Jam and Farm Heroes and mid-play the app just goes black… most times it eventually comes back to life, sometimes I have to shut the app down. I also have issues with Amber Alerts… the alert buzzes which is fine but sometimes, the buzz continues even if I hit the X key to close the message. Any idea if they are looking at all the issues noted above? Appreciate forums like this to vent and get advice 🙂 </p>

<p> I don’t have those issues. Two days ago my s6 edge got destroyed by google assistant. The assistant started turning it self on by it self, now it turns on the camera too. I turned it off following online instructions I found and its still turning on. My home button is dead most of the day but the sensor is working. Lock button sometimes works, sometimes don’t. When apps and cam start turning off and on , I have to wait for the battery to go 0% for the phone to turn off so that I can charge it and… Read more » </p>

<p> I have an ATT S6 Edge Plus. Loved it for over a year… After the recent nougat update, I’ve had terrible connectivity issues. Anything that transmits basically. Wifi, 4g, data… text messages just spin in limbo, phone signals are poor, and regular data… where I used to be strong, is non-existant. Was in a waiting room looking atound at everyone happily scrolling through facebook, messaging, watching vids… and mine says “offline”… what happened? Also… while texting… text locks up and I have to wait for it to catch up… then can continue texting. Frustrating. </p>

<p> I am using a S6 SM-G920V originally from Verizon unlocked After 7.0 update every time I boot phone it says searching for service & can’t receive calls or texts unless I dial any number first. I changed to a new sim card & that not fixed it. I tried a non activated AT&T & Tracfone sim & a non activated Verizon sim & it says the carrier like it should. Once you activate it the problem exists again. Using a non Verizon sim says this is not a Verizon phone which is annoying but can’t disable that. GPS not work… Read more » </p>

<p> Hello, I don’t know if anyone can help with me with this issue but I’ll give it a try. I’ve got a S6 edge 64GB which had no problems when running with Android 6. But since I installed the update for Android 7, I’ve got freezing/crashing issues with several messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Telegram and even the Facebook app. While I’m typing in a message, suddenly the keyboard and the app freezes and crashes. After that the system gives me the option to restart the app or send a report. I already tried out the factory reset (deleted all the… Read more » </p>
<p> I solved the problem. It seems that it was caused by the Samsung keyboard. I use the Google keyboard “Gboard” since yesterday and had no crashes/freezes till now. So if anyone faces the same issues, try using another keyboard than the one from Samsung. </p>
<p> I have an S6 Edge (SM G925T) TMobile that has lost bluetooth with the Nougat update. I have done resets, cache clear, safe mode, partition removal, etc and I can get it back for short period. Once I use the phone BT will quit. If I restart phone once BT is functioning it is off again. IF someoen will tell where to throw it I want to write a note and tie it to a rock and let Google know what I think…. </p>
<p> Still not working. Thank you Google for killing a very important feature of my phone. Samsung should be at bat for its customers. Apple has issues but they fix them to get full function back ASAP. How do you think this issue affects my thoughts on next consumer electronics purchase? I have house full of low performing Samsung appliances and now a phone that will not let me legally use it via a BT hands-free connection in my vehicles. </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> IPad Pro arbitrarily stops charging. Cable is pulled out and pushed back in, charging resumes. Tried wiggling the cable and connectors thinking the problem was in hardware. After trying three cables and two chargers, I’ve concluded this is in 11.1.2. </p>

<p> I have a huge problem with battery drainage after upgrading from 11.1.1 to iOS 11.1.2 on my iphone 6s. I lost about 20% only for 3 hours even it was on idle. Has anybody encountered the same issue like me. </p>
<p> Apple shouldn’t have released it before being sure that would not have caused any issues for consumers </p>

<p> iPhone 6 – When using apps my screen rotates on its on and if I try to tilt the phone it won’t go back to normal so I just close the app and reopen. This update has also slowed my phone down a lot. Thinking of going back to Samsung! </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy A50 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy A50 is steadily climbing the ladder to the top of the mid-range segment. It appears that the phone became an instant success, as Samsung reshaped its mid-range strategy to bring an even better pack for the value. </p>
<p> Sure, the Galaxy A50 is an all-around exceptional device. But no smartphone is perfect, as some issues arise sooner or later. And this has nothing to do with the A50 being a mid-range device. After all, the Galaxy S10 has a plethora of issues, as well. It all comes down to how you use your phone. </p>
<p> So, if you recently encountered a certain problem on your Galaxy A50, chances are I’ll mention it in this article. Just find the problem you’re looking for, and I hope you’ll find the solution, as well. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Fingerprint issue </p>
<p> Although the A50 doesn’t feature an ultra-sonic fingerprint sensor, as its flagship cousin does, we can still include it in the first generation of smartphones to boast an optical in-display scanner. As much as Samsung (and all other companies) tested it before the official launch, it’s still the first generation. And the first generation of any tech isn’t the most reliable one. </p>
<p> Users notice that in everyday use. There are numerous reports of the fingerprint sensor missing the scan or not working properly. If you too have to say a few bad words about the in-display scanner, I’m sorry, but you just have to bear with it and keep in mind it’s the first generation tech that doesn’t work as intended every time. </p>
<p> Sure, Samsung promises software updates that will supposedly improve the fingerprint scanner’s responsiveness and accuracy, but whether that will indeed be the case is questionable. The only thing left for you is to keep your phone up to date and hope for the best. Changing or removing the screen protector could also be helpful, but I honestly doubt it’s the main reason for the slow fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> 2. No LED notification light </p>
<p> If you’re wondering why the LED light doesn’t blink when you receive a notification (as it probably did on your previous smartphone), it’s because the Galaxy A50 doesn’t have one. This is not a problem per se, but maybe you missed this information when researching the A50 before you bought it, so it doesn’t hurt if I mention it again. </p>
<p> 3. Internet connection problems </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing internet connection problems, try clearing the browser cache and data. If the issue persists, check this article for additional solutions. </p>
<p> 4. Bluetooth problems </p>
<p> A few users reported an unusual Bluetooth problem that prevents them from pairing their phone with a Bluetooth device. Apparently, there’s still no real solution to this problem. Hopefully, Samsung will address the pairing issue in some of the future updates. </p>
<p> Sure, I can tell you to try generic solutions like restarting your phone, re-establishing the connection, check if the Airplane mode is disabled, but I doubt any of these will actually resolve the problem. It won’t hurt if you try, though. </p>
<p> 5. Battery drains </p>
<p> Battery drain is perhaps the biggest problem A50 owners face right now. And when your phone has a 4000 mAh battery, the last thing you have in mind is a battery drain. But it just seems to be happening. </p>
<p> Apparently, some of the recent updates messed up with battery, so there’s really nothing you can do, except waiting for Samsung to release a fixing update. Nobody knows when will it happen, so keep checking every day. </p>
<p> In the meantime, make sure some other factors don’t affect the battery life. For example, go to Settings > Battery usage, and see which app consumes the most power. If you notice something unusual, uninstall or at least limit that app. </p>
<p> 6. Can’t play Netflix in HD </p>
<p> In case you’re unable to play Netflix videos in HD, I have bad news for you. Streaming Netflix in HD is not supported on the Galaxy A50! But it shouldn’t be like this, because the Galaxy A50 supports the Widevine L1 DRM, which is enough to play HD videos on streaming platforms. </p>
<p> However, even if the phone has the prerequisites, Netflix is hesitant to allow it to stream HD content for some reason. Nobody knows when/if this conflict will be resolved. What we do know is that some older versions of the Netflix app actually allow HD content, which adds up to the confusion even more. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, if you can’t live without watching Netflix in HD, you can install an APK file of some previous version of the app. According to users, the last working version is Netflix 6.20.1 build 51 31579. </p>
<p> 7. Screen brightness too high </p>
<p> Samsung’s AMOLED displays are great, maybe the best in the business! But the vibrant colors and screen brightness might seem a bit unusual, especially for users coming from IPS displays. </p>
<p> So, if the screen on your new Galaxy A50 appears too bright, it’s just the way Samsung AMOLED displays work and should look. However, you can still adjust some settings to make the screen more appealing to your eyes. </p>
<p> Just go to settings, and change the screen mode to Basic. Even if you’re not satisfied with the end result, give it some time for your eyes and brain to get accustomed to the new vibrant screen. </p>
<p> That’s about it. If you’ve encountered a problem I didn’t list in this article or you have some additional questions, write it down in the comments below, and we’ll try to find the solution together. </p>

<p> After casting to the Tv, I had no sound for almost 24 hr. Couldn’t even make a phone call bcuz I couldn’t hear anyone. It finally resolved. Now 2 wks later no sound again for any video apps – Hulu, Netflix, Pluto. Plus all video is in fast forward speed. I’ve restarted several times, turned off and back on. I can’t fix it!!! </p>
<p> My A50 just keeps on flashing the lock screen. When your watching a video, the lock screen suddenly pops up. Anyone who encountered this problem as well? </p>
<p> I have the same problem, it even does it when its doing nothing on the table. The screen just light up on the lockscreen for no reason. </p>

<p> My Samsung A50 (2 months old) just died and will not start up. There was still a fair amount of a charge on this phone when it shut down. </p>
<p> Same as mine bro whats wrong with samsung its so bad all a50s dont deserve being on market </p>
<p> Happened to my samsung A50 when I was updating the OS. Turns out it didnt update properly and somehow bricked only the screen. I got the screen changed for free and it’s working fine now. Maybe the same problem occured to you? </p>
<p> It’s a very common problem I think. I took my A50S to the repair shop (3 different onces) and they all said the motherboard is toast. </p>

<p> Huawei P10 Lite common issues, and how to resolve them </p>
<p> Huawei’s enormous growth is well-justified by the devices they delivered in the last few years. It’s only the question of time before they get to contest first place with Apple or Samsung. And latest flagship ”P” handsets are definitely a step forward in many regards. </p>
<p> Even though P10 Lite isn’t on the same level as P10 and P10 plus flagships, it’s an amazing mid-range handset that rewards users with a slick design, great IPS LCD screen and overall above-average performance. It comes with the latest version of Huawei Android variation, EMUI 5.1, and to date, P10 Lite received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, after some time, issues started to pile up. Don’t get us wrong, this is is the case with most other devices and the problems we enlisted below aren’t common and widespread. But, if you have any issues with your latest acquisition, make sure to check the list below and look up for a solution. </p>
<p> Battery drainage </p>
<p> Huawei is not known for fast battery drainage on previous devices, but, it seems that the latest addition to P lite series is somewhat troubled in that regard. With the 3000 mAh, P10 Lite battery doesn’t lack longevity, at least if you’re not an intensive user. Fast charging is a great improvement over P9 and will let you recharge much faster. However, it seems that the EMUI 5.1 kind of drains more battery than EMUI 5.0 and the more demanding screen is a greater consumer, too. </p>
<p> Some users reported that the battery life is underwhelming, so we prepared some tips for you to improve it. If you’re unsure what to do, the steps below should be informative. </p>
<p> Disable power-consuming background apps. You can do that within the Phone Manager > Lock Screen Cleanup. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location Mode, and choose Device only if you’re not in need of GPS’s high accuracy at the moment. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location > 3-dot Menu > Scan settings, and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, respectively. </p>
<p> Reset phone in Safe mode and look for changes. If the battery life is much longer, that would imply that some 3rd-party app is hogging on your battery. Most of the time, the problem is resolved by uninstalling lately installed apps. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Disable Auto brightness and set a preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Slow speed and lag </p>
<p> In the hardware department, P10 Lite is probably one of the best-buy models in the mid-range category. It’s fast and reliable as they come. However, the occasional issues with performance aren’t unusual. Some of them reported freezes after unlocking while others have had experienced performance drops while running some demanding games. </p>
<p> Even the manufacturer said that the eMMC memory instead of faster UFS. That’s just like that. Another thing that might affect performance drops is related to overheating which we will address below. </p>
<p> If you’ve experienced something similar, there are some things you can do to resolve the issue. </p>
<p> Restart your device. If it won’t react to standard Power Off procedure, you can force shut down by holding the Power button long enough. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. Follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Let the phone cool down for a while. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> SIM card issues </p>
<p> Just as the previous iterations in P Lite series, P10 Lite supports either dual-SIM or SIM + SD card variation. Now, it’s not exactly hard to set up preferred cards in the compartment, but there are some things to know. Firstly, only the primary SIM card supports 3G and above technologies. Second is exclusively bound to 2G. So, if you’ve experienced connection losses or a network coverage error, make sure to check which card you use. </p>
<p> In addition, you should double check is everything set as intended before the suspicion of hardware malfunction arises. In addition, you can restart your device and look for changes. After that, you shouldn’t have any problems with the SIM card. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issue </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues were not uncommon for Huawei handsets before, and they are still present for some users of P10 Lite. Some of them reported connectivity issues while trying to pair their phone with the car media board or a wireless headset. For some, the connection is unstable and crashing frequently, while others weren’t able to connect in the first place. Firstly, you must make sure that the P10 Lite is the culprit for the failed pairing. Check connection with multiple devices to make sure that the phone is the problem. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, follow the instructions below to resolve the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Make sure that the Airplane mode is disabled. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Clear pairing and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Try disabling Wi-Fi and Mobile Data while using Bluetooth. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, you should contact your vendor or responsible carrier since the problem is certainly hardware-related. </p>
<p> Fingerprint scanner issues </p>
<p> The fingerprint scanner is more than a useful feature on flagship devices. But, lately, even the mid-range devices are packing reader with a variety of nifty uses. And Huawei is one of the first large manufacturers that started implementing fingerprint reader on the majority of its devices. The scanner on Huawei P10 Lite is just as fast and well-placed like on P9. But, there’s still a problem or two regarding its occasional erratic behavior. </p>
<p> There are some workarounds you can apply before concurring that the hardware is the problem. </p>
<p> Clean your fingerprint scanner. Use a wet cloth to clean the fingerprint scanner of dirt. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable fingerprint gestures. Open Settings > Fingerprint ID, and disable all gestures except the standard unlock feature. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> In the end, if the problem is persistent, contact your vendor or carrier and report the problem. </p>
<p> Volume issues </p>
<p> Certain users reported issues with the sound volume of certain apps notifications and many other aspects, with the exclusion of ringer sound that works as intended. Namely, some of them reported too loud or quiet notifications and other multimedia features. And even though they tried to regulate or even mute the sound, it still remained the same. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to wait for the future update which should resolve the sound bug. Meanwhile, you can use the ”Do not disturb” mode to disable certain sounds. In addition, try some of these workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Boot in safe mode. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC with HiSuite. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> Overheating issues </p>
<p> Another problem that emerged with the introduction of massive hardware improvements is the overheating. And most of the modern smartphones will eventually get hot, but some of them are more prone to it than others. Huawei P10 Lite, for example, is prone to overheating. Especially in the upper back part. Don’t get us wrong, this occurrence requires certain circumstances, like intensive gaming or exposure to the sun for an extended period, or use during charging. </p>
<p> Because of that, make sure to keep your phone far from the heat sources and leave it be while fast charging. In addition, don’t use alternative, commercial chargers instead of the one OEM provided you with. </p>
<p> Moreover, if the device overheating occurs during the idle state or standard use, make sure to take it for repair or ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Besides the Bluetooth issue, there are additional problems that are also related to connectivity. Namely, some users reported poor Wi-Fi signal or constant disconnection while using P10 Lite. In addition, others are experiencing poor connection while using Mobile data. There are so many factors for this occurrence, and many of those are not exclusively phone-related. </p>
<p> We enlisted some of the probable solutions for the problem and you can find them just below. </p>
<p> Mobile Data troubleshooting: </p>
<p> Switch Network type. Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. Go to Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Forget network and re-establish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz. It lacks range, but it’s a more stable option. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition within Recovery settings. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> After that, your connectivity issues should be long gone. In contrary, if those steps failed to resolve the issue at hand, make sure to report the problem to service or to manufacturer support itself. </p>
<p> That should be it. If you have any additional problems or alternative solutions for the ones presented, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Do you get a response on screen or little symbol at the top? If so, swipe down from the top and if you see a message notification, press and hold and an a small menu will pop up giving you options. You can silence and block the app and sound and vibrate. Hope this helps. </p>

<p> Which type of incoming message? Text, Facebook or other. If it’s text and it’s the huawei p10 lite, then while in text screen, click on 3 dots and select settings at the bottom of screen and click on ringtones and vibration and select a ringtone. If that doesn’t work there a little symbol saying restore defaults. That will put everything back to normal. After all is done, turn off your phone and then restart. I hope this helps. </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> In your case, the best solution is product replacement but if you have your phone more than the prescribed period for the replacement the only way is to factory reset. I have no other choice. 🙁 </p>
<p> Hi, my phone wont turn on but the screen said “fastboot mode”, after draining it up to 0%, I charged it up to 30 minutes, then I tried to open it it said: </p>

<p> [Recovery Mode] [Fastboot Mode] [Normal Boot] </p>

<p> Huawei Honor 8 most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei has gained a lot of popularity lately with both Mate (flagship) and Honor (mid-range) series. Honor 8 is the latest addition to the list of mid-budget devices produced by the Chinese company. Upon presentation for the US and EU market, the phone received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, even though Honor 8 offers good performance for an affordable price, there are some common issues worth mentioning. Users reported various problems with both hardware and software. It seems that the producer addressed some of the problems, but there is a large number of those that they need to resolve. Today we listed for you the known issues and possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Video crash while playing </p>
<p> As some of the users stated, the Honor 8 have a lot of issues with the video playback or streaming. It seems that the video crashes and, on some occasion, a restart is the only solution to get things work again. According to them, the crash occurs in online or offline videos, regardless. On the other hand, the fundament of the problem is YouTube. </p>
<p> We have noticed that the problem is widespread and the main culprit is integration with third-party apps. For the standard videos, first and foremost is to check the format. Honor 8 supports these video formats: </p>
<p> WMV </p>
<p> RM </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the online streaming videos are the ones with issues, make sure that you reinstall the given app or try an alternative. It seems that the Honor 8 have a certain level off incompatibility with some of them. Additionally, if the problem is persistent, you should contact customers support and ask for a replace. </p>
<p> Video recording stutter in third-party apps </p>
<p> While this is not as crushing (no pun intended) as the previous issue, it can be as annoying. Namely, many users reported lag and stutter while recording videos on Snapchat or Instagram story. This often leads to unsynchronized audio and video. </p>
<p> This seems to be related to awkward camera overheating. You should check the top of your phone for temperature changes. If the phone’s temperature is normal, try restarting your phone and clearing the app cache and data. Moreover, you can check your battery temperature by typing this code in your dialer *#*#2846579#*#*. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the phone is overheated (and that seems to happen often with some users), you’ll have to let it cool down. The camera behavior is not a strong feature of this model since the following default software is underwhelming. We’ll have to wait and see are there any fixes prepared in the next update build. </p>
<p> 3G works instead LTE, WiFI won’t connect </p>
<p> Connectivity is a common issue with the Honor 8. A large number of users reported problems related both to Wi-Fi and data networks. The phone won’t connect to a known network for ages or it chooses 3G instead of much faster LTE. </p>
<p> You can try following workarounds for data network issue: </p>
<p> Switch Network type: Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings: Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and reestablish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> The Huawei confirmed that they are aware of the Wi-Fi issue. We can hope that they’ll fix it with the next patch. </p>
<p> Echo while calling </p>
<p> Some users reported a problem with in-call speaker and mic malfunction. According to them, they hear the echo while speaking on the phone. The issue is more present when the loudspeaker is ON. </p>
<p> This is a common issue with many Android-powered phones. Most of the time it is related to pre-installed Google app called TalkBack. Our advice is to turn it off. </p>
<p> No battery percentage was shown </p>
<p> Honor 8 isn’t presenting battery percentage on the home screen by default. Most of the users are accustomed to that feature and they want to enable it but don’t know how. And this is the simplest way: </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon. </p>
<p> In the upper right corner, you’ll see 3 icons. </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon that is in the middle. </p>
<p> Notifications are not displayed when screen is off </p>
<p> Some of the users were left in disbelief when their push notifications from various apps stopped. It can be a quite annoying experience that ruins all-around impression about the phone. Which is pretty great in all manners. </p>
<p> Huawei made a strange decision to improve battery life by completely disabling the notifications while the screen is off. Luckily, that can be changed in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Protected apps. </p>
<p> Add apps that you want to receive notifications from. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this article helpful. Additionally, we are sure that the phone will function much better once it gets updated to Nougat 7.0. The update cycle started on 10th February so be sure to check your phones. </p>

<p> I have Honor 8 Lite, and it doesnot save new contacts. I can see the name when i press edit, but names do not save. I saw that someone on. this forum had the same problem, and was advice to follow the procedure below, which i have tried but still doesnt work for me. I dont know why Huawei makes it sooooo complicated: “Try navigating to Contacts > 3-dot More menu > Display preferences > Tap All Contacts.” (It doesnt work for me. Please help </p>
<p> Do not key in the name of the contact person at name prefix. Key in at the first name will solve your problem </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/galaxy-a70-issues/comment-page-3" parent_folder="web1" id="file17848756" filename="comment-page-3">
<p> Samsung Galaxy A70 common problems and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung has firmly re-entered the midrange segment this year. Users already love the company’s budget champion, the Galaxy A50, and its bigger brother, the A70, only improves on an already strong base. </p>
<p> Sure, the A70 might not be the best value for money in the whole A series, but it offers something authentic. It brings a good portion of the Galaxy Note experience with its huge AMOLED display. Only for the chunk of the price. If you value big phones, but don’t want to spend a small fortune, the Galaxy A70 is a way to go. You probably think the same way, and that’s why you just bought this device. </p>
<p> But then, the first problems start to appear. And there aren’t too many things as annoying as problems on a phone fresh out of the box. That’s why I compiled a list of the most common problems with the Galaxy A70 for you. Just find the issue that’s bothering you, and you’ll either find a solution, or understand the problem better. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Touch screen issues </p>
<p> When the phone’s highlight feature is its display, the last thing you’d want or expect is some screen-related problem. Unfortunately, that appears to be exactly the biggest problem with the A70. Forums are flooded with reports complaining about touch screen issues, of whom the biggest problem appears to be the multi-touch. </p>
<p> Apparently, users are having multi-touch issues in games that use the movement stick, like PUBG. Namely, when you drag the stick to keep moving, it stops registering your finger, so you have to lift it and press the stick again. </p>
<p> I couldn’t find a solution to this problem anywhere. That means Samsung will probably address it in an update. However, there are reports about users already receiving an update that claims to fix the multi-touch issue, but it still persists. </p>
<p> I can only advise you to keep checking for new updates, and hope for the best. Hopefully, Samsung will deal with this problem once and for all in the future. </p>
<p> 2. Wi-Fi problems </p>
<p> One user has reported on Samsung forums that he’s unable to connect to his home Wi-Fi network. Other than that, Wi-Fi doesn’t appear to be the problem on the A70. Nevertheless, if you can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network, make sure everything’s okay with your router first. </p>
<p> If you can’t connect to any Wi-Fi network, try some of the solutions listed in this article. </p>
<p> 3. Overheating issue </p>
<p> Just like the reported Wi-Fi problem, overheating doesn’t appear to be a widespread problem with the Galaxy A70. However, it’s been reported, so I feel like I should include it, anyway. </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing overheating on your brand new Galaxy A70, try some of the following workarounds: </p>
<p> Disable background services, like Bluetooth, NFC, location, etc. </p>
<p> Lower the screen brightness. </p>
<p> Disable the always-on display. </p>
<p> Try a different case. </p>

<p> 4. Fingerprint scanner not working </p>
<p> Another new feature the A series brings to the table is the in-display fingerprint scanner. And once again, the real-life results are great, to say the least. There are numerous reports on the forums about the A70’s fingerprint scanner either being slow or not working at all. </p>
<p> Sure, this is still a first-generation technology, and you shouldn’t expect it to work flawlessly 100% of the time. Plus, the fact that Samsung doesn’t use premium hardware in the A70 doesn’t help. But still, you want it to function to a degree where it’s at least usable. </p>
<p> Some users have reported that the fingerprint scanner started working normally after a few updates. On the other hand, some say the issue persists even on up-to-date devices. So, the only thing left for you, if you’re experiencing the fingerprint scanner issues, is to keep checking for updates and hope for the best. If the problem persists, consider replacing your phone at the store. </p>
<p> 5. Lags while gaming </p>
<p> A few reports suggest that users are expiriencing lags while gaming. Esentially, this is true, but it’s probably not a problem per se. This alleged lagging issue is actually CPU throtthling caused by a high temperature. In case you’re not familiar with the term, when your phone reaches a certain temperature, it automatically “throttles” the speed of both GPU and CPU to prevent overheating. That process is called “throttling”. </p>
<p> So, if you’ve been gaming for an extensive period of time, your phone will reach a certain temperature, and it will throttle the power of your hardware. Which means you’ll have less resources to work with, and your performance will suffer. Especially in more demanding games. </p>
<p> In that manner, if your game starts stuttering, just put your phone down for an hour, and let it cool off. You shouldn’t experience any more lagging problems afterwards. Additionally, this can also happen if your phone already overheats, like mentioned above. In that case, try some of the recommended solutions to prevent overheating. </p>
<p> That’s about it. As you can see, there aren’t too many things to worry about with the A70, which makes this phone a pretty sure bet. Sure, possible touch screen problems could get annoying but you’ll get used to it eventually. And who knows, maybe Samsung will resolve everything with a future update. </p>
<p> If you have any comments, questions, or you’ve experienced a problem I didn’t mention here, feel free to share it with us in the comments below. </p>

<p> A70 has a charging port issue. I was advised by the repair technician that removing or bending the cable from the charging port while charging the phone could sometimes damage the internal connector of the phone attached to internal circuit board and battery, and prevent any new usb c cable from charging the battery. The phone doesn’t have a sturdy internal charging connector and breaks easily. </p>

<p> Had my A70 for two months now, the phone jumps between apps, most notably is WhatsApp, but it affects most, and is really infuriating when trying to draft messages, emails etc. </p>
<p> Just after two days of buying my A70 I faced heating issue. I have tried what you mention above. But those are not helping me at all. </p>

<p> A70 less than 6 months old. Lower screen buttons stopped working after an update, incredibly frustrating as I use our company service report app for work around 20 times per day. I have a small business and have been a very satisfied Samsung user for a decade with our 8 phones but this has cured me. I will not be using Samsung from here on. Might try Oppo </p>

<p> I bought a new A70 from samsung dealer in Sep 2019, few weeks later it stoped charging. Repaired through samsung service center and same issue started after two weeks. After three time service they replaced me with new one. Today after six weeks usage I am having same issue with my new A70. </p>
<p> I have had my phone in for same reason after 3 weeks got phone back a day later same issue not charging so just had to send it bk again its so frustrating not even a year old I have had so many issues with this phone </p>
<p> Mines the same im on my 3rd one in 6 months been told all they will do is replace it this one is now crashing out when fast charging but can still charge normally </p>
<p> Yes me too. Its got a pretty week internal charging connector. Breaks easily by yanking or bending slightly a connected usb c cable. </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram Videos Not Playing On Android </p>
<p> Instagram has become an integral part of the ever-growing social networks family. Besides standard photos, you’re also able to share short GIF-like videos. If the picture is worth 1000 words, the video must be worth a bit more, does it? </p>
<p> While Instagram rarely has stability issues, the video playback can get stuck from time to time. Additionally, that can lead to app crash or instability or nervous breakdowns. So, if you are experiencing video issues, you’ve come to the right spot. Let’s try and resolve this issue together and get those videos up and running. </p>
<p> Update Instagram app </p>
<p> The first step you should take is updating your Instagram app. Most of the time, the problem lies in outdated version. Because of that, make sure you have the latest version at any given time. The auto-update should do the job for you, but you can look up for updates manually, too. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Tap Menu. </p>
<p> Look up for Instagram in Update tab. </p>
<p> Choose to update. </p>
<p> Once it’s done, open Instagram and try playing videos. </p>
<p> In case the videos still won’t play, let’s try additional steps. </p>
<p> Clear Instagram app cache and data </p>
<p> As same as the most of the apps do, Instagram stores a lot of data on your phone. With particular settings, every picture or video you post can be preserved on the phone storage or SD card. Moreover, there’s a lot of cache files that may slow down the app gradually and impact video playback. </p>
<p> According to that, your next step should be clearing cache and data from the Instagram app. Follow these instructions to clear Data and Cache. </p>
<p> Clear Cache and Data. </p>
<p> Some users use specific apps for automatic clearing of cache. However, we advise you not to use them. Firstly, they take your storage space, and secondly, they tend to work in the background and slow down all-around performance. Simply put, that kind of apps are more disadvantage than a valid tool. </p>
<p> Reinstall Instagram </p>
<p> Sometimes the apps may stuck because of some kind of the corruption. Software sometimes has a mind of its own and the only viable solution is reinstallation. So, if you’ve tried previous steps and the videos still won’t load, try this out. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Most of the time, this should resolve your issue. Of course, if the software is an issue. However, sometimes the connection may play the main part in this Instagram wrongdoings. Move on to the next step to troubleshoot the connection. </p>
<p> Restart Wi-Fi router </p>
<p> Some users reported on various forums that the Instagram videos work on Wi-Fi but won’t work on mobile data and vice versa. So, the first step is to restart your Wi-Fi router. Turn it off, wait a minute or so, and then turn it on. </p>
<p> Additionally, you may want to update router firmware and change from 5 GHz band to 2.4 GHz. Even though the 5 GHz supports higher speeds, it’s signal isn’t as reliable as 2.4 GHz over distance. That, of course, is not an issue with dual-band routers. </p>
<p> Reset your Network settings </p>
<p> Once you’ve tweaked your router, let’s reset network settings on the phone. That should fix common connection bugs and let you start from the scratch. Have in mind that you’ll need to reestablish the settings again. </p>
<p> Choose Network Settings Reset. </p>
<p> Tap RESET SETTINGS. </p>
<p> Turn off Power-saving mode </p>
<p> Thanks to one of our readers, we obtained another workaround that just may be the one that resolves the problem. He resolved the problem by disabling the Power-saving mode, that somehow interferes with the Instagram videos playback. So, navigate to Power settings, disable Power-saving mode and your problem should be sorted out. </p>
<p> Thanks a lot to Matt that suggested this solution. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. In case you have any additional problems with Instagram, please be free to tell us in the comments, or reach us out on Twitter. We’ll do our best to help you resolve them. </p>

It played the first day and hasn’t played since. I’ve tried everything to fix it but nothing seems to work. Any ideas? Is it because I deleted the actual video from my phone? </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> My Nexus 5X is not slower but since it was updated to Oreo 5 days ago it is practically unusable – it restarts on it’s own every few minutes (sometimes every 5 minutes, sometimes after 1.5 hours, one never knows), the keyboard keeps disappearing while I type (extremely annoying!), the battery drains super fast (with the screen off and no use – from 100% to 5% in 4 hours!) and the top third of the machine really heats up. </p>

<p> Yes, slow and laggy, and some functions (i.e. adding words to dictionary) don’t work at all. And while I understand that phones apparently evolve at the speed of light (or rather, at the speed of cornering market share and maximizing profits) calling my 2016 Nexus 5x an “older phone” is completely ridiculous. There’s no way that a phone I’ve owned for about a year should be rendered obsolete with one update. </p>

<p> Since Oreo update the phone is absolutely unusable. – Ultra laggy – Apps randomly crash or get killed (who knows) – Voice calls get stopped randomly – Music gets stopped randomly – Keyboard takes 7+ seconds to show up – launching apps from launcher 5+ seconds </p>

<p> Same problem here. My nexus 5x performance after Oreo update was really affected, mainly in terms of fluidity and battery getting drained so fast that I have to charge my phone at least 2 times a day and before a full charge was enough. </p>

<p> iOS 13.5.1 issues: Battery drain, Bluetooth problems, and more </p>
<p> Apple recently released the latest iOS 13.5.1 update. The update is available to users of all compatible iPhone Models. Unlike the previous update, this one doesn’t bring any new features but instead focuses on improving the overall security of the OS. </p>
<p> Although Apple’s update release notes aren’t very clear on what exactly the new update does, it does state that the update addresses the vulnerability exploited by the uncover jailbreak. With that being said, most jailbreakers would want to avoid this update. The rest of the users can comfortably install this release, and they won’t notice any difference in the way their iPhone works. </p>
<p> Or will they? </p>
<p> Although the new update brings zero new features, it actually causes some problems to users who installed it. Users are reporting battery drains, Bluetooth issues, connectivity problems, and more. </p>
<p> However, none of the problems seems to be widespread, as these are the individually reported cases. You have better chances of installing the update without any problems, than being stuck with an annoying issue. Nevertheless, I’m going to list some of the reported problems here, so you can see what could potentially go wrong. </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 battery drain </p>
<p> Reports about the battery drain caused by iOS 13.5.1 have been circulating on Twitter since the update’s release. Here’s one of the complaints: </p>
<p> @AppleSupport iphone battery draining like crazy after upgrading to iOS 13.5.1. What’s going on? Is there a fix?? </p>
<p> Right now, the solution to this problem is unknown. It appears that users experiencing the battery drain issue will have to wait for Apple to release a follow-up update. </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> Although reported by the smaller number of users, it appears that Bluetooth also doesn’t work for some people who installed iOS 13.5.1. </p>
<p> @Apple my phones Bluetooth just won’t connect to any device even though it’s turned on and discoverable? Any ideas </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 Face ID issues </p>
<p> Although iOS 13.5 improved Face ID to make it work with face masks, some people apparently have problems with it stretching to iOS 13.5.1. </p>
<p> @AppleSupport Why my face id isn’t working? I just updated to ios 13.5.1 and now it’s keep telling me that face id is not available! Can you help me? </p>
<p> Other problems </p>
<p> Besides the above-mentioned issues that appear to be more common, there are also a few more problems, including a camera problem, weird charging (though this one wasn’t specified, so I can’t tell you whether it was indeed caused by iOS 13.5.1, and a SIM card issue where the phone shows SIM cards as invalid. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, there are no confirmed solutions to any of these problems. Apple support usually recommends generic solutions to particular problems, by I doubt any of those will be helpful. Users that were hit by the update will probably have to wait for a patch. </p>

<p> Been talking with Apple tech support on two long chat sessions and they gave up. Since installing iOS 13.5.1, my phone crashes multiple times daily. When it crashes then restarts, battery power is 9% or lower. Just before crash battery power typically 80% or greater. If I reboot twice in a row, battery power will go back to 80% plus then typically crash a few minutes later. Crashes sometimes occur when I start an app but sometimes when I’m in the middle of using the phone, as a phone. Phone also intermittently runs hot. Phone has been wiped clean twice… Read more » </p>

<p> Redmi Note 8 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Xiaomi doesn’t play around and the output of devices they introduce yearly is crazy for all industry standards. Not even 8 months after the Chinese giant introduced the Redmi Note 7 (and its variations, 7S and 7 Pro), the Redmi Note 8 (along with 8 Pro and 8T) have hit the market. </p>
<p> This appears to be a great device, just like its predecessor, with the Penta-camera (if we include the selfie cam) setup being the major upgrade over the Redmi Note 7. The device has its flaws but they are hard not to look over considering the price point of Note 8. </p>
<p> Today, we made sure to provide you with the list of the most common Redmi Note 8 issues with applicable solutions. If you have any problems with the device, continue reading below or just jump to a section of your interest. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Touchscreen is laggy </p>
<p> Some users reported that the touchscreen (display) is laggy and that was later identified as a software issue on the official global ROM. In our knowledge, the problem is dealt with on later updates. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, if the display is laggy or animations are slow, make sure to follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > My device > System and check for updates. Install an update if available. </p>
<p> Enable Developer options (Settings > My device > All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number). Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options and disable MIUI Optimization at the bottom. </p>
<p> Get back in Developer options and reduce Animation from 1 to 0.5. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings (the procedure is explained at the bottom of this article). </p>
<p> 2. Battery drain issues </p>
<p> Although the 4000 mAh battery should be big enough to give the Redmi Note 8 an exquisite Screen-on Time, users are reporting issues with battery drains. There are multiple things that might affect battery life but, when it comes to MIUI-powered devices, our first suspect is a lack of optimization on the current ROM. </p>
<p> Updates cause battery drains and new updates usually solve them. So, first of all, make sure that your Redmi Note 8 is up to date in regards to the firmware. After that, you can check these tips to reduce battery drains significantly: </p>
<p> Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Disable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and individually disable Autostart on apps. </p>
<p> Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery. </p>
<p> 3. SIM card won’t activate </p>
<p> Moving on, there are reports about the SIM card not working. Namely, it seems that the SIM card won’t activate on this handset for some European and Asian users. Now, we need you to ensure that your device is on the Global MIUI ROM where all necessary bands are available. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, try reinserting the SIM card into the alternative socket and try again. Make sure to reboot your device after doing so. If the problem is still persistent, update the firmware or reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> There’s a slight chance that we are looking at the manufacturing defect, so you can also contact your retailer for service. </p>
<p> 4. Notification icons not showing </p>
<p> Missing notifications on MIUI is probably the longest-running problem Xiaomi/Redmi users experienced. The fact that someone at their software development department decided that it’s a good idea for notification icons to disappear after a few seconds from the Status bar is preposterous. </p>
<p> Luckily, you don’t have to worry about that the moment MIUI gets available. Which already is, although based on Android 9 Pie instead of Android 10. </p>
<p> The problem with notifications is completely solved on MIUI 11, but if you are still not seeing notification icons, here’s how to enable them with ease: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open Display. </p>
<p> Select Notch & status bar. </p>
<p> Under the Status bar section, enable Show icons for incoming notifications. </p>
<p> 5. Low sound volume on headphones </p>
<p> This is also quite a common occurrence, especially on wireless (Bluetooth) headphones or buds. Users say that the volume on their headphones is not high at all, even on the highest settings. Seemingly, there is a workaround to it and we already wrote about it, here. </p>
<p> What you need to do is toggle on the Disable absolute volume option in the Developer options menu. </p>
<p> An alternative is to tweak audio output with certain Magisk modules, which requires root. We don’t recommend that approach if you are not experienced with modding ROMs. </p>
<p> 6. Google Assistant not working </p>
<p> Another quite common problem reported on various forums concerns Google Assistant that won’t work on the Redmi Note 8. The Voice Match for Google Assistant’s voice commands appears greyed out for some users. </p>
<p> This problem seems to be related to MIUI, both 10 and 11, and we don’t have any official response by Xiaomi. There are some things you can try in order to resolve this but, as we said already, this is a widespread issue and, until Xiaomi resolves the problem with their OS skin, we can mainly wait. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to try and solve Google Assistant not working on Redmi Note 8: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Google and clear cache and data. </p>
<p> Leave the Google Beta program from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Uninstall Google updates and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings > Apps > Manage apps. Tap on the 3-dot menu and open Default apps. From there, open Assist & voice input. Under the Assist app, select Google. </p>
<p> Delete and retrain the Voice model. </p>
<p> 7. The Call recording option is missing </p>
<p> This isn’t a bug or anything similar. Namely, due to rules in different regions and in accordance with Google’s privacy regulations (they paid a hefty fee for privacy infringement case), Xiaomi won’t deliver their Contacts and dialer app with an option to record calls. This option is not allowed in Europe and various other regions around the globe. </p>
<p> So, if you badly want this option, consider unlocking the bootloader and flashing either an official ROM from supported regions or flashing Xiaomi EU ROM that has it. </p>
<p> 8. Delay on Lock Screen </p>
<p> This can fall into the overall lag issues with the device but we decided to give it a separate spot on the list. Namely, some users have said that there’s an unexpected 4 seconds delay when they are on the Lock Screen and just after unlocking the device. </p>
<p> For the time being, we don’t have many insights to offer but you can try disabling Tap to wake and disabling the double-press Power button to start a camera. Alternatively, you should ensure that the firmware is up to date or reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 9. GCAM not working on Note 8 </p>
<p> One of the best things about the Redmi Note 8 is that it supports Google Camera ports without rooting your device. Although you won’t be able to utilize all lenses with GCAM, the standard mode photography along with the Night Mode are much better than on the stock camera app. </p>
<p> However, since the device is (still) new, users run into a lot of GCAM ports that crash or won’t work in certain mods. We recommend downloading the GCAM from an acknowledged developer, here. </p>
<p> Just make sure to, before you run the app for the first time, clear all cache and data. That will prevent crashes. </p>
<p> 10. Tips: How to wipe cache partition or factory reset Redmi Note 8 </p>
<p> Finally, we made sure to provide you with two valuable procedures that, if things go awry, might help you get your device in the working condition again. </p>
<p> Here’s how to wipe cache partition on Redmi Note 8 and solve certain issues: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> And this is how to reset your device to factory settings: </p>
<p> Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> Additionally, if you dislike bloatware that comes with MIUI, we have just the right article for you. Learn how to easily debloat your Redmi Note 8 with the steps explained here. No unlocking bootloader or root needed. </p>
<p> With that side note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and we hope this piece shed some light on issues you experienced.

<p> Samsung Galaxy A50 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy A50 is steadily climbing the ladder to the top of the mid-range segment. It appears that the phone became an instant success, as Samsung reshaped its mid-range strategy to bring an even better pack for the value. </p>
<p> Sure, the Galaxy A50 is an all-around exceptional device. But no smartphone is perfect, as some issues arise sooner or later. And this has nothing to do with the A50 being a mid-range device. After all, the Galaxy S10 has a plethora of issues, as well. It all comes down to how you use your phone. </p>
<p> So, if you recently encountered a certain problem on your Galaxy A50, chances are I’ll mention it in this article. Just find the problem you’re looking for, and I hope you’ll find the solution, as well. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Fingerprint issue </p>
<p> Although the A50 doesn’t feature an ultra-sonic fingerprint sensor, as its flagship cousin does, we can still include it in the first generation of smartphones to boast an optical in-display scanner. As much as Samsung (and all other companies) tested it before the official launch, it’s still the first generation. And the first generation of any tech isn’t the most reliable one. </p>
<p> Users notice that in everyday use. There are numerous reports of the fingerprint sensor missing the scan or not working properly. If you too have to say a few bad words about the in-display scanner, I’m sorry, but you just have to bear with it and keep in mind it’s the first generation tech that doesn’t work as intended every time. </p>
<p> Sure, Samsung promises software updates that will supposedly improve the fingerprint scanner’s responsiveness and accuracy, but whether that will indeed be the case is questionable. The only thing left for you is to keep your phone up to date and hope for the best. Changing or removing the screen protector could also be helpful, but I honestly doubt it’s the main reason for the slow fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> 2. No LED notification light </p>
<p> If you’re wondering why the LED light doesn’t blink when you receive a notification (as it probably did on your previous smartphone), it’s because the Galaxy A50 doesn’t have one. This is not a problem per se, but maybe you missed this information when researching the A50 before you bought it, so it doesn’t hurt if I mention it again. </p>
<p> 3. Internet connection problems </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing internet connection problems, try clearing the browser cache and data. If the issue persists, check this article for additional solutions. </p>
<p> 4. Bluetooth problems </p>
<p> A few users reported an unusual Bluetooth problem that prevents them from pairing their phone with a Bluetooth device. Apparently, there’s still no real solution to this problem. Hopefully, Samsung will address the pairing issue in some of the future updates. </p>
<p> Sure, I can tell you to try generic solutions like restarting your phone, re-establishing the connection, check if the Airplane mode is disabled, but I doubt any of these will actually resolve the problem. It won’t hurt if you try, though. </p>
<p> 5. Battery drains </p>
<p> Battery drain is perhaps the biggest problem A50 owners face right now. And when your phone has a 4000 mAh battery, the last thing you have in mind is a battery drain. But it just seems to be happening. </p>
<p> Apparently, some of the recent updates messed up with battery, so there’s really nothing you can do, except waiting for Samsung to release a fixing update. Nobody knows when will it happen, so keep checking every day. </p>
<p> In the meantime, make sure some other factors don’t affect the battery life. For example, go to Settings > Battery usage, and see which app consumes the most power. If you notice something unusual, uninstall or at least limit that app. </p>
<p> 6. Can’t play Netflix in HD </p>
<p> In case you’re unable to play Netflix videos in HD, I have bad news for you. Streaming Netflix in HD is not supported on the Galaxy A50! But it shouldn’t be like this, because the Galaxy A50 supports the Widevine L1 DRM, which is enough to play HD videos on streaming platforms. </p>
<p> However, even if the phone has the prerequisites, Netflix is hesitant to allow it to stream HD content for some reason. Nobody knows when/if this conflict will be resolved. What we do know is that some older versions of the Netflix app actually allow HD content, which adds up to the confusion even more. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, if you can’t live without watching Netflix in HD, you can install an APK file of some previous version of the app. According to users, the last working version is Netflix 6.20.1 build 51 31579. </p>
<p> 7. Screen brightness too high </p>
<p> Samsung’s AMOLED displays are great, maybe the best in the business! But the vibrant colors and screen brightness might seem a bit unusual, especially for users coming from IPS displays. </p>
<p> So, if the screen on your new Galaxy A50 appears too bright, it’s just the way Samsung AMOLED displays work and should look. However, you can still adjust some settings to make the screen more appealing to your eyes. </p>
<p> Just go to settings, and change the screen mode to Basic. Even if you’re not satisfied with the end result, give it some time for your eyes and brain to get accustomed to the new vibrant screen. </p>
<p> That’s about it. If you’ve encountered a problem I didn’t list in this article or you have some additional questions, write it down in the comments below, and we’ll try to find the solution together. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy A70 common problems and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung has firmly re-entered the midrange segment this year. Users already love the company’s budget champion, the Galaxy A50, and its bigger brother, the A70, only improves on an already strong base. </p>
<p> Sure, the A70 might not be the best value for money in the whole A series, but it offers something authentic. It brings a good portion of the Galaxy Note experience with its huge AMOLED display. Only for the chunk of the price. If you value big phones, but don’t want to spend a small fortune, the Galaxy A70 is a way to go. You probably think the same way, and that’s why you just bought this device. </p>
<p> But then, the first problems start to appear. And there aren’t too many things as annoying as problems on a phone fresh out of the box. That’s why I compiled a list of the most common problems with the Galaxy A70 for you. Just find the issue that’s bothering you, and you’ll either find a solution, or understand the problem better. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Touch screen issues </p>
<p> When the phone’s highlight feature is its display, the last thing you’d want or expect is some screen-related problem. Unfortunately, that appears to be exactly the biggest problem with the A70. Forums are flooded with reports complaining about touch screen issues, of whom the biggest problem appears to be the multi-touch. </p>
<p> Apparently, users are having multi-touch issues in games that use the movement stick, like PUBG. Namely, when you drag the stick to keep moving, it stops registering your finger, so you have to lift it and press the stick again. </p>
<p> I couldn’t find a solution to this problem anywhere. That means Samsung will probably address it in an update. However, there are reports about users already receiving an update that claims to fix the multi-touch issue, but it still persists. </p>
<p> I can only advise you to keep checking for new updates, and hope for the best. Hopefully, Samsung will deal with this problem once and for all in the future. </p>
<p> 2. Wi-Fi problems </p>
<p> One user has reported on Samsung forums that he’s unable to connect to his home Wi-Fi network. Other than that, Wi-Fi doesn’t appear to be the problem on the A70. Nevertheless, if you can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network, make sure everything’s okay with your router first. </p>
<p> If you can’t connect to any Wi-Fi network, try some of the solutions listed in this article. </p>
<p> 3. Overheating issue </p>
<p> Just like the reported Wi-Fi problem, overheating doesn’t appear to be a widespread problem with the Galaxy A70. However, it’s been reported, so I feel like I should include it, anyway. </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing overheating on your brand new Galaxy A70, try some of the following workarounds: </p>
<p> Disable background services, like Bluetooth, NFC, location, etc. </p>
<p> Lower the screen brightness. </p>
<p> Disable the always-on display. </p>
<p> Try a different case. </p>
<p> Install the latest updates. </p>
<p> 4. Fingerprint scanner not working </p>
<p> Another new feature the A series brings to the table is the in-display fingerprint scanner. And once again, the real-life results are great, to say the least. There are numerous reports on the forums about the A70’s fingerprint scanner either being slow or not working at all. </p>
<p> Sure, this is still a first-generation technology, and you shouldn’t expect it to work flawlessly 100% of the time. Plus, the fact that Samsung doesn’t use premium hardware in the A70 doesn’t help. But still, you want it to function to a degree where it’s at least usable. </p>
<p> Some users have reported that the fingerprint scanner started working normally after a few updates. On the other hand, some say the issue persists even on up-to-date devices. So, the only thing left for you, if you’re experiencing the fingerprint scanner issues, is to keep checking for updates and hope for the best. If the problem persists, consider replacing your phone at the store. </p>
<p> 5. Lags while gaming </p>
<p> A few reports suggest that users are expiriencing lags while gaming. Esentially, this is true, but it’s probably not a problem per se. This alleged lagging issue is actually CPU throtthling caused by a high temperature. In case you’re not familiar with the term, when your phone reaches a certain temperature, it automatically “throttles” the speed of both GPU and CPU to prevent overheating. That process is called “throttling”. </p>
<p> So, if you’ve been gaming for an extensive period of time, your phone will reach a certain temperature, and it will throttle the power of your hardware. Which means you’ll have less resources to work with, and your performance will suffer. Especially in more demanding games. </p>
<p> In that manner, if your game starts stuttering, just put your phone down for an hour, and let it cool off. You shouldn’t experience any more lagging problems afterwards. Additionally, this can also happen if your phone already overheats, like mentioned above. In that case, try some of the recommended solutions to prevent overheating. </p>
<p> That’s about it. As you can see, there aren’t too many things to worry about with the A70, which makes this phone a pretty sure bet. Sure, possible touch screen problems could get annoying but you’ll get used to it eventually. And who knows, maybe Samsung will resolve everything with a future update. </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> Iphone 5s. My battery just drains. Literally 1% per minute. </p>

<p> My iPhone SE freeze in the middle on a conversation, the other person could not hear me anymore, but I could hear him. My friend hang up, I could see the incoming call but was unable to answer him. I’m unable to enlarge pictures. Unable to enter my nip if the phone is flat on the table (when I pick it up it will work fine). The phone will scroll through a page by itself, and much much more… This happen since Friday Nov 24th 2017, I updated IOS 11.1 2 maybe 2 days before, but had my screen changed… Read more » </p>

<p> Iphone 7+ audio coming out mainly from the telephone speaker instead of the main one at the bottom, so I can hardly hear anything unless I turn up the volume to half the maximum and the sound quality sucks so bad ? </p>
<p> Yes I agree. I never meant to install the iOS 11.1.2 update it was an accident and one I deeply regret. My battery goes down from 75% to 60% in less than a minute causing crazy battery life problems </p>

<p> Huawei P10 Lite common issues, and how to resolve them </p>
<p> Huawei’s enormous growth is well-justified by the devices they delivered in the last few years. It’s only the question of time before they get to contest first place with Apple or Samsung. And latest flagship ”P” handsets are definitely a step forward in many regards. </p>
<p> Even though P10 Lite isn’t on the same level as P10 and P10 plus flagships, it’s an amazing mid-range handset that rewards users with a slick design, great IPS LCD screen and overall above-average performance. It comes with the latest version of Huawei Android variation, EMUI 5.1, and to date, P10 Lite received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, after some time, issues started to pile up. Don’t get us wrong, this is is the case with most other devices and the problems we enlisted below aren’t common and widespread. But, if you have any issues with your latest acquisition, make sure to check the list below and look up for a solution. </p>
<p> Battery drainage </p>
<p> Huawei is not known for fast battery drainage on previous devices, but, it seems that the latest addition to P lite series is somewhat troubled in that regard. With the 3000 mAh, P10 Lite battery doesn’t lack longevity, at least if you’re not an intensive user. Fast charging is a great improvement over P9 and will let you recharge much faster. However, it seems that the EMUI 5.1 kind of drains more battery than EMUI 5.0 and the more demanding screen is a greater consumer, too. </p>
<p> Some users reported that the battery life is underwhelming, so we prepared some tips for you to improve it. If you’re unsure what to do, the steps below should be informative. </p>
<p> Disable power-consuming background apps. You can do that within the Phone Manager > Lock Screen Cleanup. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location Mode, and choose Device only if you’re not in need of GPS’s high accuracy at the moment. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location > 3-dot Menu > Scan settings, and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, respectively. </p>
<p> Reset phone in Safe mode and look for changes. If the battery life is much longer, that would imply that some 3rd-party app is hogging on your battery. Most of the time, the problem is resolved by uninstalling lately installed apps. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Disable Auto brightness and set a preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Slow speed and lag </p>
<p> In the hardware department, P10 Lite is probably one of the best-buy models in the mid-range category. It’s fast and reliable as they come. However, the occasional issues with performance aren’t unusual. Some of them reported freezes after unlocking while others have had experienced performance drops while running some demanding games. </p>
<p> Even the manufacturer said that the eMMC memory instead of faster UFS. That’s just like that. Another thing that might affect performance drops is related to overheating which we will address below. </p>
<p> If you’ve experienced something similar, there are some things you can do to resolve the issue. </p>
<p> Restart your device. If it won’t react to standard Power Off procedure, you can force shut down by holding the Power button long enough. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. Follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Let the phone cool down for a while. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> SIM card issues </p>
<p> Just as the previous iterations in P Lite series, P10 Lite supports either dual-SIM or SIM + SD card variation. Now, it’s not exactly hard to set up preferred cards in the compartment, but there are some things to know. Firstly, only the primary SIM card supports 3G and above technologies. Second is exclusively bound to 2G. So, if you’ve experienced connection losses or a network coverage error, make sure to check which card you use. </p>
<p> In addition, you should double check is everything set as intended before the suspicion of hardware malfunction arises. In addition, you can restart your device and look for changes. After that, you shouldn’t have any problems with the SIM card. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issue </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues were not uncommon for Huawei handsets before, and they are still present for some users of P10 Lite. Some of them reported connectivity issues while trying to pair their phone with the car media board or a wireless headset. For some, the connection is unstable and crashing frequently, while others weren’t able to connect in the first place. Firstly, you must make sure that the P10 Lite is the culprit for the failed pairing. Check connection with multiple devices to make sure that the phone is the problem. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, follow the instructions below to resolve the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Make sure that the Airplane mode is disabled. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Clear pairing and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Try disabling Wi-Fi and Mobile Data while using Bluetooth. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, you should contact your vendor or responsible carrier since the problem is certainly hardware-related. </p>
<p> Fingerprint scanner issues </p>
<p> The fingerprint scanner is more than a useful feature on flagship devices. But, lately, even the mid-range devices are packing reader with a variety of nifty uses. And Huawei is one of the first large manufacturers that started implementing fingerprint reader on the majority of its devices. The scanner on Huawei P10 Lite is just as fast and well-placed like on P9. But, there’s still a problem or two regarding its occasional erratic behavior. </p>
<p> There are some workarounds you can apply before concurring that the hardware is the problem. </p>
<p> Clean your fingerprint scanner. Use a wet cloth to clean the fingerprint scanner of dirt. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable fingerprint gestures. Open Settings > Fingerprint ID, and disable all gestures except the standard unlock feature. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> In the end, if the problem is persistent, contact your vendor or carrier and report the problem. </p>
<p> Volume issues </p>
<p> Certain users reported issues with the sound volume of certain apps notifications and many other aspects, with the exclusion of ringer sound that works as intended. Namely, some of them reported too loud or quiet notifications and other multimedia features. And even though they tried to regulate or even mute the sound, it still remained the same. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to wait for the future update which should resolve the sound bug. Meanwhile, you can use the ”Do not disturb” mode to disable certain sounds. In addition, try some of these workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Boot in safe mode. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC with HiSuite. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> Overheating issues </p>
<p> Another problem that emerged with the introduction of massive hardware improvements is the overheating. And most of the modern smartphones will eventually get hot, but some of them are more prone to it than others. Huawei P10 Lite, for example, is prone to overheating. Especially in the upper back part. Don’t get us wrong, this occurrence requires certain circumstances, like intensive gaming or exposure to the sun for an extended period, or use during charging. </p>
<p> Because of that, make sure to keep your phone far from the heat sources and leave it be while fast charging. In addition, don’t use alternative, commercial chargers instead of the one OEM provided you with. </p>
<p> Moreover, if the device overheating occurs during the idle state or standard use, make sure to take it for repair or ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Besides the Bluetooth issue, there are additional problems that are also related to connectivity. Namely, some users reported poor Wi-Fi signal or constant disconnection while using P10 Lite. In addition, others are experiencing poor connection while using Mobile data. There are so many factors for this occurrence, and many of those are not exclusively phone-related. </p>
<p> We enlisted some of the probable solutions for the problem and you can find them just below. </p>
<p> Mobile Data troubleshooting: </p>
<p> Switch Network type. Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. Go to Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Forget network and re-establish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz. It lacks range, but it’s a more stable option. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition within Recovery settings. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> After that, your connectivity issues should be long gone. In contrary, if those steps failed to resolve the issue at hand, make sure to report the problem to service or to manufacturer support itself. </p>
<p> That should be it. If you have any additional problems or alternative solutions for the ones presented, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> Huawei Honor 8 most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei has gained a lot of popularity lately with both Mate (flagship) and Honor (mid-range) series. Honor 8 is the latest addition to the list of mid-budget devices produced by the Chinese company. Upon presentation for the US and EU market, the phone received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, even though Honor 8 offers good performance for an affordable price, there are some common issues worth mentioning. Users reported various problems with both hardware and software. It seems that the producer addressed some of the problems, but there is a large number of those that they need to resolve. Today we listed for you the known issues and possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Video crash while playing </p>
<p> As some of the users stated, the Honor 8 have a lot of issues with the video playback or streaming. It seems that the video crashes and, on some occasion, a restart is the only solution to get things work again. According to them, the crash occurs in online or offline videos, regardless. On the other hand, the fundament of the problem is YouTube. </p>
<p> We have noticed that the problem is widespread and the main culprit is integration with third-party apps. For the standard videos, first and foremost is to check the format. Honor 8 supports these video formats: </p>
<p> WMV </p>
<p> RM </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the online streaming videos are the ones with issues, make sure that you reinstall the given app or try an alternative. It seems that the Honor 8 have a certain level off incompatibility with some of them. Additionally, if the problem is persistent, you should contact customers support and ask for a replace. </p>
<p> Video recording stutter in third-party apps </p>
<p> While this is not as crushing (no pun intended) as the previous issue, it can be as annoying. Namely, many users reported lag and stutter while recording videos on Snapchat or Instagram story. This often leads to unsynchronized audio and video. </p>
<p> This seems to be related to awkward camera overheating. You should check the top of your phone for temperature changes. If the phone’s temperature is normal, try restarting your phone and clearing the app cache and data. Moreover, you can check your battery temperature by typing this code in your dialer *#*#2846579#*#*. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the phone is overheated (and that seems to happen often with some users), you’ll have to let it cool down. The camera behavior is not a strong feature of this model since the following default software is underwhelming. We’ll have to wait and see are there any fixes prepared in the next update build. </p>
<p> 3G works instead LTE, WiFI won’t connect </p>
<p> Connectivity is a common issue with the Honor 8. A large number of users reported problems related both to Wi-Fi and data networks. The phone won’t connect to a known network for ages or it chooses 3G instead of much faster LTE. </p>
<p> You can try following workarounds for data network issue: </p>
<p> Switch Network type: Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings: Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and reestablish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> The Huawei confirmed that they are aware of the Wi-Fi issue. We can hope that they’ll fix it with the next patch. </p>
<p> Echo while calling </p>
<p> Some users reported a problem with in-call speaker and mic malfunction. According to them, they hear the echo while speaking on the phone. The issue is more present when the loudspeaker is ON. </p>
<p> This is a common issue with many Android-powered phones. Most of the time it is related to pre-installed Google app called TalkBack. Our advice is to turn it off. </p>
<p> No battery percentage was shown </p>
<p> Honor 8 isn’t presenting battery percentage on the home screen by default. Most of the users are accustomed to that feature and they want to enable it but don’t know how. And this is the simplest way: </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon. </p>
<p> In the upper right corner, you’ll see 3 icons. </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon that is in the middle. </p>
<p> Notifications are not displayed when screen is off </p>
<p> Some of the users were left in disbelief when their push notifications from various apps stopped. It can be a quite annoying experience that ruins all-around impression about the phone. Which is pretty great in all manners. </p>
<p> Huawei made a strange decision to improve battery life by completely disabling the notifications while the screen is off. Luckily, that can be changed in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Protected apps. </p>
<p> Add apps that you want to receive notifications from. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this article helpful. Additionally, we are sure that the phone will function much better once it gets updated to Nougat 7.0. The update cycle started on 10th February so be sure to check your phones. </p>

<p> Hi, i got quite an annoying issue with my Honor 8. Pretty much every time i connect my headphones it activates some voice activated search app, and also turns the volume up and down, pauses music and hangs up calls and changes songs when i listen to music. This only happens when the headphones are plugged in, and ive tried with several different ones. I would be very grateful if anyone could tell me what’s wrong, thanks 🙂 </p>

<p> Just a little point. How do I download video and pictures to my PC. With my other phone a cable connection gave me a file / folder point to select from DCIM to copy or move to the hard drive. These don;t have that option . Is there an option to send the pictures etc.. I don’t have any memory card fitted in the phone as their is no slot. Just a sim card which I don’t want to remove. </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram Videos Not Playing On Android </p>
<p> Instagram has become an integral part of the ever-growing social networks family. Besides standard photos, you’re also able to share short GIF-like videos. If the picture is worth 1000 words, the video must be worth a bit more, does it? </p>
<p> While Instagram rarely has stability issues, the video playback can get stuck from time to time. Additionally, that can lead to app crash or instability or nervous breakdowns. So, if you are experiencing video issues, you’ve come to the right spot. Let’s try and resolve this issue together and get those videos up and running. </p>
<p> Update Instagram app </p>
<p> The first step you should take is updating your Instagram app. Most of the time, the problem lies in outdated version. Because of that, make sure you have the latest version at any given time. The auto-update should do the job for you, but you can look up for updates manually, too. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Tap Menu. </p>
<p> Look up for Instagram in Update tab. </p>
<p> Choose to update. </p>
<p> Once it’s done, open Instagram and try playing videos. </p>
<p> In case the videos still won’t play, let’s try additional steps. </p>
<p> Clear Instagram app cache and data </p>
<p> As same as the most of the apps do, Instagram stores a lot of data on your phone. With particular settings, every picture or video you post can be preserved on the phone storage or SD card. Moreover, there’s a lot of cache files that may slow down the app gradually and impact video playback. </p>
<p> According to that, your next step should be clearing cache and data from the Instagram app. Follow these instructions to clear Data and Cache. </p>
<p> Clear Cache and Data. </p>
<p> Some users use specific apps for automatic clearing of cache. However, we advise you not to use them. Firstly, they take your storage space, and secondly, they tend to work in the background and slow down all-around performance. Simply put, that kind of apps are more disadvantage than a valid tool. </p>
<p> Reinstall Instagram </p>
<p> Sometimes the apps may stuck because of some kind of the corruption. Software sometimes has a mind of its own and the only viable solution is reinstallation. So, if you’ve tried previous steps and the videos still won’t load, try this out. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Most of the time, this should resolve your issue. Of course, if the software is an issue. However, sometimes the connection may play the main part in this Instagram wrongdoings. Move on to the next step to troubleshoot the connection. </p>
<p> Restart Wi-Fi router </p>
<p> Some users reported on various forums that the Instagram videos work on Wi-Fi but won’t work on mobile data and vice versa. So, the first step is to restart your Wi-Fi router. Turn it off, wait a minute or so, and then turn it on. </p>
<p> Additionally, you may want to update router firmware and change from 5 GHz band to 2.4 GHz. Even though the 5 GHz supports higher speeds, it’s signal isn’t as reliable as 2.4 GHz over distance. That, of course, is not an issue with dual-band routers. </p>
<p> Reset your Network settings </p>
<p> Once you’ve tweaked your router, let’s reset network settings on the phone. That should fix common connection bugs and let you start from the scratch. Have in mind that you’ll need to reestablish the settings again. </p>
<p> Choose Network Settings Reset. </p>
<p> Tap RESET SETTINGS. </p>
<p> Turn off Power-saving mode </p>
<p> Thanks to one of our readers, we obtained another workaround that just may be the one that resolves the problem. He resolved the problem by disabling the Power-saving mode, that somehow interferes with the Instagram videos playback. So, navigate to Power settings, disable Power-saving mode and your problem should be sorted out. </p>
<p> Thanks a lot to Matt that suggested this solution. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. In case you have any additional problems with Instagram, please be free to tell us in the comments, or reach us out on Twitter. We’ll do our best to help you resolve them. </p>

<p> nothing workd tired everything please help i have a Lg Phoenix 2 and nothing works Instagram videos take forever to load and Live doesn’t want to load either i need help right away </p>
<p> The latest update is not always the solution. I’ve had an issue with the videos on my S8 for a few weeks and tried all of these and none of them worked. The only thing that worked was to delete the app and install an older version and it worked perfectly so it seems to be an issue with the app. Possibly a bug </p>

<p> I’ve tried until clear cache and data and restart the phone. Then got frustrated and hopeless since it didn’t work. I thought restarting Wi-Fi router wouldn’t solve the problem, then I read until the last, and tried disabling my phone’s (S8) power saving mode. Then IT WORKED!! Should have read until the end first haha. I think for Samsung S8, S8+, that’s where the problem lies at. It’s annoying though, that we cannot enable power saving mode while on insta 🙁 </p>

<p> I’m suffering this issue since my phone updated to Nougat. I don’t understand why I can’t have powersave yet still be able to watch Instagram videos. That’s the only solution from above that works. </p>
<p> I take the above comment back – videos also not playing even though I’m NOT in power saving mode (S6). </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> iOS 13.5.1 issues: Battery drain, Bluetooth problems, and more </p>
<p> Apple recently released the latest iOS 13.5.1 update. The update is available to users of all compatible iPhone Models. Unlike the previous update, this one doesn’t bring any new features but instead focuses on improving the overall security of the OS. </p>
<p> Although Apple’s update release notes aren’t very clear on what exactly the new update does, it does state that the update addresses the vulnerability exploited by the uncover jailbreak. With that being said, most jailbreakers would want to avoid this update. The rest of the users can comfortably install this release, and they won’t notice any difference in the way their iPhone works. </p>
<p> Or will they? </p>
<p> Although the new update brings zero new features, it actually causes some problems to users who installed it. Users are reporting battery drains, Bluetooth issues, connectivity problems, and more. </p>
<p> However, none of the problems seems to be widespread, as these are the individually reported cases. You have better chances of installing the update without any problems, than being stuck with an annoying issue. Nevertheless, I’m going to list some of the reported problems here, so you can see what could potentially go wrong. </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 battery drain </p>
<p> Reports about the battery drain caused by iOS 13.5.1 have been circulating on Twitter since the update’s release. Here’s one of the complaints: </p>
<p> @AppleSupport iphone battery draining like crazy after upgrading to iOS 13.5.1. What’s going on? Is there a fix?? </p>
<p> Right now, the solution to this problem is unknown. It appears that users experiencing the battery drain issue will have to wait for Apple to release a follow-up update. </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> Although reported by the smaller number of users, it appears that Bluetooth also doesn’t work for some people who installed iOS 13.5.1. </p>
<p> @Apple my phones Bluetooth just won’t connect to any device even though it’s turned on and discoverable? Any ideas </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 Face ID issues </p>
<p> Although iOS 13.5 improved Face ID to make it work with face masks, some people apparently have problems with it stretching to iOS 13.5.1. </p>
<p> @AppleSupport Why my face id isn’t working? I just updated to ios 13.5.1 and now it’s keep telling me that face id is not available! Can you help me? </p>
<p> Other problems </p>
<p> Besides the above-mentioned issues that appear to be more common, there are also a few more problems, including a camera problem, weird charging (though this one wasn’t specified, so I can’t tell you whether it was indeed caused by iOS 13.5.1, and a SIM card issue where the phone shows SIM cards as invalid. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, there are no confirmed solutions to any of these problems. Apple support usually recommends generic solutions to particular problems, by I doubt any of those will be helpful. Users that were hit by the update will probably have to wait for a patch. </p>
<p> Have you experienced any issues after installing iOS 13.5.1? If so, feel free to share them with us in the comments below. </p>

<p> For some reason my Iphone SE gets super hot his even after closing all running apps. I think the underlying issue is and excessive use of CPU is being used. Maybe and infinite loop somewhere? Anyway to work around this, I simply put the phone in battery save mode and seems to solve the over heating problem. </p>

<p> My iPhone 7 is possessed. It fully charges overnight…is 100% when I get up. I unplug it and within just a few minutes, it goes down to like 12% and then shuts down on it’s own. Yesterday, it shut down multiple times randomly. I wasn’t even using it. My phone normally holds a pretty good charge, so I’m guessing this is a new issue that came with the last update. I have experienced it several times over the past few weeks but can’t seem to find any consistency to test it with. I’m on iOS 13.5.1. </p>

<p> My IPhone 6s Recently within the past two days has been overheating like crazy. I have checked they my phone and is in perfect condition with no viruses or bugs, but I found out that a lot of people are experiencing the same problem as me. I’m beginning to think it is because of the IOS 13.5.1 update due to the fact I installed it late and the problems have recently started coming in. The back of my phone around the camera area is so hot I’m afraid it might actually be burning the inner parts of the phone. It’s… Read more » </p>
<p> Mine is exactly the same since it updated to 13.5.1 🙁 It was perfect before and literally changed overnight. Not one bit happy </p>
<p> My iPhone 7 max is is also unusable after this update to 13.5.1for the same reasons massive overheating and battery drain. When is Apple going to take responsibility and fix this. If they don’t do it soon I’m going to have to lose all my data and reset my phone back to a previous iOS. Otherwise I’m walking around with a $1000 piece of junk in my bag that doesn’t even have the battery power to last a single call Shame on Apple. </p>
<p> My iPhone 6s+ is over heating while making a call or using Bluetooth and WiFi. </p>

<p> Oh yes! Since the iOS 13.5.1 upgrade on my Apple XRI I cannot connect to any of my usual devices, Samsung Sound Bar, Pioneer DAB Car Radio or Fitbit Charge 3. I’ve spoken with Apple but they doubt it is their problem. </p>
<p> I’ve done all the so called “fix” proceedures but nothing has worked. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy A50 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy A50 is steadily climbing the ladder to the top of the mid-range segment. It appears that the phone became an instant success, as Samsung reshaped its mid-range strategy to bring an even better pack for the value. </p>
<p> Sure, the Galaxy A50 is an all-around exceptional device. But no smartphone is perfect, as some issues arise sooner or later. And this has nothing to do with the A50 being a mid-range device. After all, the Galaxy S10 has a plethora of issues, as well. It all comes down to how you use your phone. </p>
<p> So, if you recently encountered a certain problem on your Galaxy A50, chances are I’ll mention it in this article. Just find the problem you’re looking for, and I hope you’ll find the solution, as well. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Fingerprint issue </p>
<p> Although the A50 doesn’t feature an ultra-sonic fingerprint sensor, as its flagship cousin does, we can still include it in the first generation of smartphones to boast an optical in-display scanner. As much as Samsung (and all other companies) tested it before the official launch, it’s still the first generation. And the first generation of any tech isn’t the most reliable one. </p>
<p> Users notice that in everyday use. There are numerous reports of the fingerprint sensor missing the scan or not working properly. If you too have to say a few bad words about the in-display scanner, I’m sorry, but you just have to bear with it and keep in mind it’s the first generation tech that doesn’t work as intended every time. </p>
<p> Sure, Samsung promises software updates that will supposedly improve the fingerprint scanner’s responsiveness and accuracy, but whether that will indeed be the case is questionable. The only thing left for you is to keep your phone up to date and hope for the best. Changing or removing the screen protector could also be helpful, but I honestly doubt it’s the main reason for the slow fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> 2. No LED notification light </p>
<p> If you’re wondering why the LED light doesn’t blink when you receive a notification (as it probably did on your previous smartphone), it’s because the Galaxy A50 doesn’t have one. This is not a problem per se, but maybe you missed this information when researching the A50 before you bought it, so it doesn’t hurt if I mention it again. </p>
<p> 3. Internet connection problems </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing internet connection problems, try clearing the browser cache and data. If the issue persists, check this article for additional solutions. </p>
<p> 4. Bluetooth problems </p>
<p> A few users reported an unusual Bluetooth problem that prevents them from pairing their phone with a Bluetooth device. Apparently, there’s still no real solution to this problem. Hopefully, Samsung will address the pairing issue in some of the future updates. </p>
<p> Sure, I can tell you to try generic solutions like restarting your phone, re-establishing the connection, check if the Airplane mode is disabled, but I doubt any of these will actually resolve the problem. It won’t hurt if you try, though. </p>
<p> 5. Battery drains </p>
<p> Battery drain is perhaps the biggest problem A50 owners face right now. And when your phone has a 4000 mAh battery, the last thing you have in mind is a battery drain. But it just seems to be happening. </p>
<p> Apparently, some of the recent updates messed up with battery, so there’s really nothing you can do, except waiting for Samsung to release a fixing update. Nobody knows when will it happen, so keep checking every day. </p>
<p> In the meantime, make sure some other factors don’t affect the battery life. For example, go to Settings > Battery usage, and see which app consumes the most power. If you notice something unusual, uninstall or at least limit that app. </p>
<p> 6. Can’t play Netflix in HD </p>
<p> In case you’re unable to play Netflix videos in HD, I have bad news for you. Streaming Netflix in HD is not supported on the Galaxy A50! But it shouldn’t be like this, because the Galaxy A50 supports the Widevine L1 DRM, which is enough to play HD videos on streaming platforms. </p>
<p> However, even if the phone has the prerequisites, Netflix is hesitant to allow it to stream HD content for some reason. Nobody knows when/if this conflict will be resolved. What we do know is that some older versions of the Netflix app actually allow HD content, which adds up to the confusion even more. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, if you can’t live without watching Netflix in HD, you can install an APK file of some previous version of the app. According to users, the last working version is Netflix 6.20.1 build 51 31579. </p>
<p> 7. Screen brightness too high </p>
<p> Samsung’s AMOLED displays are great, maybe the best in the business! But the vibrant colors and screen brightness might seem a bit unusual, especially for users coming from IPS displays. </p>
<p> So, if the screen on your new Galaxy A50 appears too bright, it’s just the way Samsung AMOLED displays work and should look. However, you can still adjust some settings to make the screen more appealing to your eyes. </p>
<p> Just go to settings, and change the screen mode to Basic. Even if you’re not satisfied with the end result, give it some time for your eyes and brain to get accustomed to the new vibrant screen. </p>
<p> That’s about it. If you’ve encountered a problem I didn’t list in this article or you have some additional questions, write it down in the comments below, and we’ll try to find the solution together. </p>

<p> Sometimes my A50 just starts flashing for no apparent reason. It happens when I’m trying to use an app, when I’m searching online, when I’m talking on the phone or texting, even when I’m not doing anything the screen will come on and just start flashing, whatever. It’s like it’s possessed lol. Shutting it down or restarting sometimes helps, but not always, and never completely. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy A70 common problems and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung has firmly re-entered the midrange segment this year. Users already love the company’s budget champion, the Galaxy A50, and its bigger brother, the A70, only improves on an already strong base. </p>
<p> Sure, the A70 might not be the best value for money in the whole A series, but it offers something authentic. It brings a good portion of the Galaxy Note experience with its huge AMOLED display. Only for the chunk of the price. If you value big phones, but don’t want to spend a small fortune, the Galaxy A70 is a way to go. You probably think the same way, and that’s why you just bought this device. </p>
<p> But then, the first problems start to appear. And there aren’t too many things as annoying as problems on a phone fresh out of the box. That’s why I compiled a list of the most common problems with the Galaxy A70 for you. Just find the issue that’s bothering you, and you’ll either find a solution, or understand the problem better. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Touch screen issues </p>
<p> When the phone’s highlight feature is its display, the last thing you’d want or expect is some screen-related problem. Unfortunately, that appears to be exactly the biggest problem with the A70. Forums are flooded with reports complaining about touch screen issues, of whom the biggest problem appears to be the multi-touch. </p>
<p> Apparently, users are having multi-touch issues in games that use the movement stick, like PUBG. Namely, when you drag the stick to keep moving, it stops registering your finger, so you have to lift it and press the stick again. </p>
<p> I couldn’t find a solution to this problem anywhere. That means Samsung will probably address it in an update. However, there are reports about users already receiving an update that claims to fix the multi-touch issue, but it still persists. </p>
<p> I can only advise you to keep checking for new updates, and hope for the best. Hopefully, Samsung will deal with this problem once and for all in the future. </p>
<p> 2. Wi-Fi problems </p>
<p> One user has reported on Samsung forums that he’s unable to connect to his home Wi-Fi network. Other than that, Wi-Fi doesn’t appear to be the problem on the A70. Nevertheless, if you can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network, make sure everything’s okay with your router first. </p>
<p> If you can’t connect to any Wi-Fi network, try some of the solutions listed in this article. </p>
<p> 3. Overheating issue </p>
<p> Just like the reported Wi-Fi problem, overheating doesn’t appear to be a widespread problem with the Galaxy A70. However, it’s been reported, so I feel like I should include it, anyway. </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing overheating on your brand new Galaxy A70, try some of the following workarounds: </p>
<p> Disable background services, like Bluetooth, NFC, location, etc. </p>
<p> Lower the screen brightness. </p>
<p> Disable the always-on display. </p>
<p> Try a different case. </p>
<p> Install the latest updates. </p>
<p> 4. Fingerprint scanner not working </p>
<p> Another new feature the A series brings to the table is the in-display fingerprint scanner. And once again, the real-life results are great, to say the least. There are numerous reports on the forums about the A70’s fingerprint scanner either being slow or not working at all. </p>
<p> Sure, this is still a first-generation technology, and you shouldn’t expect it to work flawlessly 100% of the time. Plus, the fact that Samsung doesn’t use premium hardware in the A70 doesn’t help. But still, you want it to function to a degree where it’s at least usable. </p>
<p> Some users have reported that the fingerprint scanner started working normally after a few updates. On the other hand, some say the issue persists even on up-to-date devices. So, the only thing left for you, if you’re experiencing the fingerprint scanner issues, is to keep checking for updates and hope for the best. If the problem persists, consider replacing your phone at the store. </p>
<p> 5. Lags while gaming </p>
<p> A few reports suggest that users are expiriencing lags while gaming. Esentially, this is true, but it’s probably not a problem per se. This alleged lagging issue is actually CPU throtthling caused by a high temperature. In case you’re not familiar with the term, when your phone reaches a certain temperature, it automatically “throttles” the speed of both GPU and CPU to prevent overheating. That process is called “throttling”. </p>
<p> So, if you’ve been gaming for an extensive period of time, your phone will reach a certain temperature, and it will throttle the power of your hardware. Which means you’ll have less resources to work with, and your performance will suffer. Especially in more demanding games. </p>
<p> In that manner, if your game starts stuttering, just put your phone down for an hour, and let it cool off. You shouldn’t experience any more lagging problems afterwards. Additionally, this can also happen if your phone already overheats, like mentioned above. In that case, try some of the recommended solutions to prevent overheating. </p>
<p> That’s about it. As you can see, there aren’t too many things to worry about with the A70, which makes this phone a pretty sure bet. Sure, possible touch screen problems could get annoying but you’ll get used to it eventually. And who knows, maybe Samsung will resolve everything with a future update. </p>

<p> Hi. Hope everyone is safe & well. It’s only happened twice but my phone doesn’t let me unlock it. I’ve found a way to solve the problem until the update sorts it out but I cant keep on doing it. Keep your finger on your turn off switch until it switches off then wait a few minutes and turn it back on. It works then. </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram Videos Not Playing On Android </p>
<p> Instagram has become an integral part of the ever-growing social networks family. Besides standard photos, you’re also able to share short GIF-like videos. If the picture is worth 1000 words, the video must be worth a bit more, does it? </p>
<p> While Instagram rarely has stability issues, the video playback can get stuck from time to time. Additionally, that can lead to app crash or instability or nervous breakdowns. So, if you are experiencing video issues, you’ve come to the right spot. Let’s try and resolve this issue together and get those videos up and running. </p>
<p> Update Instagram app </p>
<p> The first step you should take is updating your Instagram app. Most of the time, the problem lies in outdated version. Because of that, make sure you have the latest version at any given time. The auto-update should do the job for you, but you can look up for updates manually, too. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Tap Menu. </p>
<p> Look up for Instagram in Update tab. </p>
<p> Choose to update. </p>
<p> Once it’s done, open Instagram and try playing videos. </p>
<p> In case the videos still won’t play, let’s try additional steps. </p>
<p> Clear Instagram app cache and data </p>
<p> As same as the most of the apps do, Instagram stores a lot of data on your phone. With particular settings, every picture or video you post can be preserved on the phone storage or SD card. Moreover, there’s a lot of cache files that may slow down the app gradually and impact video playback. </p>
<p> According to that, your next step should be clearing cache and data from the Instagram app. Follow these instructions to clear Data and Cache. </p>
<p> Clear Cache and Data. </p>
<p> Some users use specific apps for automatic clearing of cache. However, we advise you not to use them. Firstly, they take your storage space, and secondly, they tend to work in the background and slow down all-around performance. Simply put, that kind of apps are more disadvantage than a valid tool. </p>
<p> Reinstall Instagram </p>
<p> Sometimes the apps may stuck because of some kind of the corruption. Software sometimes has a mind of its own and the only viable solution is reinstallation. So, if you’ve tried previous steps and the videos still won’t load, try this out. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Most of the time, this should resolve your issue. Of course, if the software is an issue. However, sometimes the connection may play the main part in this Instagram wrongdoings. Move on to the next step to troubleshoot the connection. </p>
<p> Restart Wi-Fi router </p>
<p> Some users reported on various forums that the Instagram videos work on Wi-Fi but won’t work on mobile data and vice versa. So, the first step is to restart your Wi-Fi router. Turn it off, wait a minute or so, and then turn it on. </p>
<p> Additionally, you may want to update router firmware and change from 5 GHz band to 2.4 GHz. Even though the 5 GHz supports higher speeds, it’s signal isn’t as reliable as 2.4 GHz over distance. That, of course, is not an issue with dual-band routers. </p>
<p> Reset your Network settings </p>
<p> Once you’ve tweaked your router, let’s reset network settings on the phone. That should fix common connection bugs and let you start from the scratch. Have in mind that you’ll need to reestablish the settings again. </p>
<p> Choose Network Settings Reset. </p>
<p> Tap RESET SETTINGS. </p>
<p> Turn off Power-saving mode </p>
<p> Thanks to one of our readers, we obtained another workaround that just may be the one that resolves the problem. He resolved the problem by disabling the Power-saving mode, that somehow interferes with the Instagram videos playback. So, navigate to Power settings, disable Power-saving mode and your problem should be sorted out. </p>
<p> Thanks a lot to Matt that suggested this solution. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. In case you have any additional problems with Instagram, please be free to tell us in the comments, or reach us out on Twitter. We’ll do our best to help you resolve them. </p>

<p> I’ve been having problems with videos not working since the last android update and I’ve tried all of these things. Both videos in my feed and my story videos. This is really disturbing because it doesn’t seem like anyone else has the same problem as I. </p>
<p> All videos on my Instagram don’t work for me either. I’ve tried everything on this kid, plus a few other things. None of it works… It’s very annoying when someone sends something and it can’t even be viewed. </p>
<p> Same issue. Just updated in the last 2 days and no videos will play on instagram. Annoying to say the least!! </p>
<p> I do. i dont know what to do, i have tried all type of troubleshooting, when i do it it work for a couple of videos and then stops playing again. The funny thing is that the videos on the stories and the sponsors they play. </p>
<p> I have a Samsung S7 edge and have the same issue. My videos won’t play in my Gallery. And now they have stopped playing in my feed too! Has anyone found a solution yet?? </p>
<p> Have you tried installing a Flash player of some kind? It’s not needed, but it’s worth a try. Additionally, try switching from mobile data to Wi-Fi and vice versa when playing videos. </p>
<p> As above, S7 not loading any videos or stories since last update. Have tried everything suggested, switching between wifi and mobile data, clearing and resetting everything and still no results </p>
<p> Don’t put your device in the power saving mode or allow the app to use data in the parameter. </p>

<p> I have a HTC One M9 and have been having the same problem since I updated my phones software a few days ago. Also, I can only uninstall the Instagram updates not the entire app since I did the phone update. </p>
<p> Mine is the HTC M10. The app can be uninstalled, but none of these solutions work. And there’s no way to clear app cache without clearing the whole app of its data, which I’ve done a few times, with no success. </p>
<p> Have you tried the factory reset? I’m aware that this approach seems extreme but it looks like the Instagram comes preinstalled in your case. So you won’t be able to reinstall it. At least, not without flashing your stock ROM: </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> iPhone 6 Plus – battery drain even when not in use once I upgraded to 11.1.2 </p>

<p> iPhone 6 and iPhone 5S have serious battery drainage while using Whatsapp, Facebook or Instagram (even when they are not being used but not closed). Before the update, those apps would use about half as much battery as they do now. Both phones get hot rapidly and my wife and I have to charge our phones at least twice a day with the same usage than before the update. </p>

<p> My iPhone 6 goes dead out of the blue and acts like it has no battery life at all and will not respond until plugged in. But when plugged in the battery is only at 85%. </p>

<p> Can someone PLEASE let me know how to roll back to ANY iOS version before 11..??!! My phone (5s) is now a total disaster, worse after “upgrading” to 11.1.2 – it would be easier to lose st what works than what doesn’t. Help!!!! </p>

<p> My updated 6s (11.1.2) will not text to a contact from the contact. It’s a pain when you receive calls that you want to text a response to. I used to be able to text a number directly from my call list even if it wasn’t a contact……..sux. </p>

<p> Updated iPhone 6 with 11.1.2 and started facing issues with battery and widget screen being super slow. resetting the phone seems to be of some help. </p>
<p> Upgraded? to 11.1.2 on an iPhone 6, and if it’s plugged into power while I’m in the car…even when stopped…I tell Siri to dial a phone number and nothing happens. I turned off as many things as I could in the crappy so-called Do Not Disturb feature, and still no luck. Grrrrrr. </p>

<p> DON’T USE WAZE unless you can charge your phone while driving. My phone went from 100% to 2% on a 1 hour drive this morning. (I needed it due to the traffic, but I needed my phone after.) </p>

<p> Upgraded my iPhone 5s to 11.1.2 and battery draining within 6 hours of little use. Prior to this I could put on charge at bedtime with still 60% plus charge left. Ended up stranded today with a dead phone, resulting in a 7 mile hike. I am so angry. Apple really needs to get its act together and sort this out. This is the first time in years that I am seriously considering changing back to an android phone. iOS 11 has been nothing but problems. Who authorises these releases, when they obviously haven’t been properly tested. For the price… Read more » </p>

<p> Huawei P10 Lite common issues, and how to resolve them </p>
<p> Huawei’s enormous growth is well-justified by the devices they delivered in the last few years. It’s only the question of time before they get to contest first place with Apple or Samsung. And latest flagship ”P” handsets are definitely a step forward in many regards. </p>
<p> Even though P10 Lite isn’t on the same level as P10 and P10 plus flagships, it’s an amazing mid-range handset that rewards users with a slick design, great IPS LCD screen and overall above-average performance. It comes with the latest version of Huawei Android variation, EMUI 5.1, and to date, P10 Lite received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, after some time, issues started to pile up. Don’t get us wrong, this is is the case with most other devices and the problems we enlisted below aren’t common and widespread. But, if you have any issues with your latest acquisition, make sure to check the list below and look up for a solution. </p>
<p> Battery drainage </p>
<p> Huawei is not known for fast battery drainage on previous devices, but, it seems that the latest addition to P lite series is somewhat troubled in that regard. With the 3000 mAh, P10 Lite battery doesn’t lack longevity, at least if you’re not an intensive user. Fast charging is a great improvement over P9 and will let you recharge much faster. However, it seems that the EMUI 5.1 kind of drains more battery than EMUI 5.0 and the more demanding screen is a greater consumer, too. </p>
<p> Some users reported that the battery life is underwhelming, so we prepared some tips for you to improve it. If you’re unsure what to do, the steps below should be informative. </p>
<p> Disable power-consuming background apps. You can do that within the Phone Manager > Lock Screen Cleanup. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location Mode, and choose Device only if you’re not in need of GPS’s high accuracy at the moment. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location > 3-dot Menu > Scan settings, and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, respectively. </p>
<p> Reset phone in Safe mode and look for changes. If the battery life is much longer, that would imply that some 3rd-party app is hogging on your battery. Most of the time, the problem is resolved by uninstalling lately installed apps. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Disable Auto brightness and set a preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Slow speed and lag </p>
<p> In the hardware department, P10 Lite is probably one of the best-buy models in the mid-range category. It’s fast and reliable as they come. However, the occasional issues with performance aren’t unusual. Some of them reported freezes after unlocking while others have had experienced performance drops while running some demanding games. </p>
<p> Even the manufacturer said that the eMMC memory instead of faster UFS. That’s just like that. Another thing that might affect performance drops is related to overheating which we will address below. </p>
<p> If you’ve experienced something similar, there are some things you can do to resolve the issue. </p>
<p> Restart your device. If it won’t react to standard Power Off procedure, you can force shut down by holding the Power button long enough. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. Follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Let the phone cool down for a while. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> SIM card issues </p>
<p> Just as the previous iterations in P Lite series, P10 Lite supports either dual-SIM or SIM + SD card variation. Now, it’s not exactly hard to set up preferred cards in the compartment, but there are some things to know. Firstly, only the primary SIM card supports 3G and above technologies. Second is exclusively bound to 2G. So, if you’ve experienced connection losses or a network coverage error, make sure to check which card you use. </p>
<p> In addition, you should double check is everything set as intended before the suspicion of hardware malfunction arises. In addition, you can restart your device and look for changes. After that, you shouldn’t have any problems with the SIM card. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issue </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues were not uncommon for Huawei handsets before, and they are still present for some users of P10 Lite. Some of them reported connectivity issues while trying to pair their phone with the car media board or a wireless headset. For some, the connection is unstable and crashing frequently, while others weren’t able to connect in the first place. Firstly, you must make sure that the P10 Lite is the culprit for the failed pairing. Check connection with multiple devices to make sure that the phone is the problem. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, follow the instructions below to resolve the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Make sure that the Airplane mode is disabled. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Clear pairing and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Try disabling Wi-Fi and Mobile Data while using Bluetooth. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, you should contact your vendor or responsible carrier since the problem is certainly hardware-related. </p>
<p> Fingerprint scanner issues </p>
<p> The fingerprint scanner is more than a useful feature on flagship devices. But, lately, even the mid-range devices are packing reader with a variety of nifty uses. And Huawei is one of the first large manufacturers that started implementing fingerprint reader on the majority of its devices. The scanner on Huawei P10 Lite is just as fast and well-placed like on P9. But, there’s still a problem or two regarding its occasional erratic behavior. </p>
<p> There are some workarounds you can apply before concurring that the hardware is the problem. </p>
<p> Clean your fingerprint scanner. Use a wet cloth to clean the fingerprint scanner of dirt. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable fingerprint gestures. Open Settings > Fingerprint ID, and disable all gestures except the standard unlock feature. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> In the end, if the problem is persistent, contact your vendor or carrier and report the problem. </p>
<p> Volume issues </p>
<p> Certain users reported issues with the sound volume of certain apps notifications and many other aspects, with the exclusion of ringer sound that works as intended. Namely, some of them reported too loud or quiet notifications and other multimedia features. And even though they tried to regulate or even mute the sound, it still remained the same. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to wait for the future update which should resolve the sound bug. Meanwhile, you can use the ”Do not disturb” mode to disable certain sounds. In addition, try some of these workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Boot in safe mode. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC with HiSuite. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> Overheating issues </p>
<p> Another problem that emerged with the introduction of massive hardware improvements is the overheating. And most of the modern smartphones will eventually get hot, but some of them are more prone to it than others. Huawei P10 Lite, for example, is prone to overheating. Especially in the upper back part. Don’t get us wrong, this occurrence requires certain circumstances, like intensive gaming or exposure to the sun for an extended period, or use during charging. </p>
<p> Because of that, make sure to keep your phone far from the heat sources and leave it be while fast charging. In addition, don’t use alternative, commercial chargers instead of the one OEM provided you with. </p>
<p> Moreover, if the device overheating occurs during the idle state or standard use, make sure to take it for repair or ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Besides the Bluetooth issue, there are additional problems that are also related to connectivity. Namely, some users reported poor Wi-Fi signal or constant disconnection while using P10 Lite. In addition, others are experiencing poor connection while using Mobile data. There are so many factors for this occurrence, and many of those are not exclusively phone-related. </p>
<p> We enlisted some of the probable solutions for the problem and you can find them just below. </p>
<p> Mobile Data troubleshooting: </p>
<p> Switch Network type. Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. Go to Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Forget network and re-establish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz. It lacks range, but it’s a more stable option. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition within Recovery settings. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> After that, your connectivity issues should be long gone. In contrary, if those steps failed to resolve the issue at hand, make sure to report the problem to service or to manufacturer support itself. </p>
<p> That should be it. If you have any additional problems or alternative solutions for the ones presented, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> Huawei Honor 8 most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei has gained a lot of popularity lately with both Mate (flagship) and Honor (mid-range) series. Honor 8 is the latest addition to the list of mid-budget devices produced by the Chinese company. Upon presentation for the US and EU market, the phone received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, even though Honor 8 offers good performance for an affordable price, there are some common issues worth mentioning. Users reported various problems with both hardware and software. It seems that the producer addressed some of the problems, but there is a large number of those that they need to resolve. Today we listed for you the known issues and possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Video crash while playing </p>
<p> As some of the users stated, the Honor 8 have a lot of issues with the video playback or streaming. It seems that the video crashes and, on some occasion, a restart is the only solution to get things work again. According to them, the crash occurs in online or offline videos, regardless. On the other hand, the fundament of the problem is YouTube. </p>
<p> We have noticed that the problem is widespread and the main culprit is integration with third-party apps. For the standard videos, first and foremost is to check the format. Honor 8 supports these video formats: </p>
<p> WMV </p>
<p> RM </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the online streaming videos are the ones with issues, make sure that you reinstall the given app or try an alternative. It seems that the Honor 8 have a certain level off incompatibility with some of them. Additionally, if the problem is persistent, you should contact customers support and ask for a replace. </p>
<p> Video recording stutter in third-party apps </p>
<p> While this is not as crushing (no pun intended) as the previous issue, it can be as annoying. Namely, many users reported lag and stutter while recording videos on Snapchat or Instagram story. This often leads to unsynchronized audio and video. </p>
<p> This seems to be related to awkward camera overheating. You should check the top of your phone for temperature changes. If the phone’s temperature is normal, try restarting your phone and clearing the app cache and data. Moreover, you can check your battery temperature by typing this code in your dialer *#*#2846579#*#*. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the phone is overheated (and that seems to happen often with some users), you’ll have to let it cool down. The camera behavior is not a strong feature of this model since the following default software is underwhelming. We’ll have to wait and see are there any fixes prepared in the next update build. </p>
<p> 3G works instead LTE, WiFI won’t connect </p>
<p> Connectivity is a common issue with the Honor 8. A large number of users reported problems related both to Wi-Fi and data networks. The phone won’t connect to a known network for ages or it chooses 3G instead of much faster LTE. </p>
<p> You can try following workarounds for data network issue: </p>
<p> Switch Network type: Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings: Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and reestablish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> The Huawei confirmed that they are aware of the Wi-Fi issue. We can hope that they’ll fix it with the next patch. </p>
<p> Echo while calling </p>
<p> Some users reported a problem with in-call speaker and mic malfunction. According to them, they hear the echo while speaking on the phone. The issue is more present when the loudspeaker is ON. </p>
<p> This is a common issue with many Android-powered phones. Most of the time it is related to pre-installed Google app called TalkBack. Our advice is to turn it off. </p>
<p> No battery percentage was shown </p>
<p> Honor 8 isn’t presenting battery percentage on the home screen by default. Most of the users are accustomed to that feature and they want to enable it but don’t know how. And this is the simplest way: </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon. </p>
<p> In the upper right corner, you’ll see 3 icons. </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon that is in the middle. </p>
<p> Notifications are not displayed when screen is off </p>
<p> Some of the users were left in disbelief when their push notifications from various apps stopped. It can be a quite annoying experience that ruins all-around impression about the phone. Which is pretty great in all manners. </p>
<p> Huawei made a strange decision to improve battery life by completely disabling the notifications while the screen is off. Luckily, that can be changed in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Protected apps. </p>
<p> Add apps that you want to receive notifications from. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this article helpful. Additionally, we are sure that the phone will function much better once it gets updated to Nougat 7.0. The update cycle started on 10th February so be sure to check your phones. </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> Same here – phone almost unusable. Google Maps Navigation is torture since it freezes and crashes randomly along with showing a greatly magnified portion of the map with no controls on the screen while navigating. Nothing to do but pull over and reboot in the middle of a trip. Cray cray. </p>

<p> I have got all these bugs you mentioned, tried switched to skia, but didn’t felt significant improvement. So then I went to settings, turned off all unnecessary apps including play game, play movies, play music, hangouts, turned open gl rendering on and after all my n5x works like a charm. </p>

<p> Still haven’t been offered an OTA update to Oreo on my 5x (Google fi) was really annoyed since I thought it should have been available in the first week or two after release but after reading this maybe I’ll hold off if it does ever show up. Keep posting and updating so the rest of us know whether to update or not when it’s available. </p>

<p> I’m glad that you made this post. Yes, it’s been awful. Even with the rendering changed, I’m still having problems typing this out. </p>
<p> I remember the same crap happened with my Nexus 4 and the Lollipop update. After a year or so, I installed Marshmallow (custom ROM) and it ran better than vanilla 5.1.1. </p>
<p> I think that’s going to be the route, this time. Hopefully Google releases 8.1 soon </p>

<p> You should also clear your device cache, that seemed to speed up my nexus quite a bit. Apps like snapchat became unusable after the oreo update, but I cleared the cache and changed the OpenGL to skia and it seems to have improved performance but it hasnt made it as good as it is on iOS for example – Snapchat doesn’t really like android users. Apps which overlay items such as facebook messenger seem to lag the phone out most of the time and especially when playing music on spotify – hope there is an update from google soon to… Read more » </p>
<p> Edit – Battery life is awful since the update, wasn’t great before but now with heavy use I get roughly 45 minutes of screen on time… </p>

<p> I just reset my phone yesterday due to lay. I hope this works, but my missing Google cards showed up immediately after changing the setting. Coincidence? Maybe, but…. Now to go back and enable “Turn on WiFi Automatically” which stopped working with Oreo! </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy A50 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy A50 is steadily climbing the ladder to the top of the mid-range segment. It appears that the phone became an instant success, as Samsung reshaped its mid-range strategy to bring an even better pack for the value. </p>
<p> Sure, the Galaxy A50 is an all-around exceptional device. But no smartphone is perfect, as some issues arise sooner or later. And this has nothing to do with the A50 being a mid-range device. After all, the Galaxy S10 has a plethora of issues, as well. It all comes down to how you use your phone. </p>
<p> So, if you recently encountered a certain problem on your Galaxy A50, chances are I’ll mention it in this article. Just find the problem you’re looking for, and I hope you’ll find the solution, as well. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Fingerprint issue </p>
<p> Although the A50 doesn’t feature an ultra-sonic fingerprint sensor, as its flagship cousin does, we can still include it in the first generation of smartphones to boast an optical in-display scanner. As much as Samsung (and all other companies) tested it before the official launch, it’s still the first generation. And the first generation of any tech isn’t the most reliable one. </p>
<p> Users notice that in everyday use. There are numerous reports of the fingerprint sensor missing the scan or not working properly. If you too have to say a few bad words about the in-display scanner, I’m sorry, but you just have to bear with it and keep in mind it’s the first generation tech that doesn’t work as intended every time. </p>
<p> Sure, Samsung promises software updates that will supposedly improve the fingerprint scanner’s responsiveness and accuracy, but whether that will indeed be the case is questionable. The only thing left for you is to keep your phone up to date and hope for the best. Changing or removing the screen protector could also be helpful, but I honestly doubt it’s the main reason for the slow fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> 2. No LED notification light </p>
<p> If you’re wondering why the LED light doesn’t blink when you receive a notification (as it probably did on your previous smartphone), it’s because the Galaxy A50 doesn’t have one. This is not a problem per se, but maybe you missed this information when researching the A50 before you bought it, so it doesn’t hurt if I mention it again. </p>
<p> 3. Internet connection problems </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing internet connection problems, try clearing the browser cache and data. If the issue persists, check this article for additional solutions. </p>
<p> 4. Bluetooth problems </p>
<p> A few users reported an unusual Bluetooth problem that prevents them from pairing their phone with a Bluetooth device. Apparently, there’s still no real solution to this problem. Hopefully, Samsung will address the pairing issue in some of the future updates. </p>
<p> Sure, I can tell you to try generic solutions like restarting your phone, re-establishing the connection, check if the Airplane mode is disabled, but I doubt any of these will actually resolve the problem. It won’t hurt if you try, though. </p>
<p> 5. Battery drains </p>
<p> Battery drain is perhaps the biggest problem A50 owners face right now. And when your phone has a 4000 mAh battery, the last thing you have in mind is a battery drain. But it just seems to be happening. </p>
<p> Apparently, some of the recent updates messed up with battery, so there’s really nothing you can do, except waiting for Samsung to release a fixing update. Nobody knows when will it happen, so keep checking every day. </p>
<p> In the meantime, make sure some other factors don’t affect the battery life. For example, go to Settings > Battery usage, and see which app consumes the most power. If you notice something unusual, uninstall or at least limit that app. </p>
<p> 6. Can’t play Netflix in HD </p>
<p> In case you’re unable to play Netflix videos in HD, I have bad news for you. Streaming Netflix in HD is not supported on the Galaxy A50! But it shouldn’t be like this, because the Galaxy A50 supports the Widevine L1 DRM, which is enough to play HD videos on streaming platforms. </p>
<p> However, even if the phone has the prerequisites, Netflix is hesitant to allow it to stream HD content for some reason. Nobody knows when/if this conflict will be resolved. What we do know is that some older versions of the Netflix app actually allow HD content, which adds up to the confusion even more. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, if you can’t live without watching Netflix in HD, you can install an APK file of some previous version of the app. According to users, the last working version is Netflix 6.20.1 build 51 31579. </p>
<p> 7. Screen brightness too high </p>
<p> Samsung’s AMOLED displays are great, maybe the best in the business! But the vibrant colors and screen brightness might seem a bit unusual, especially for users coming from IPS displays. </p>
<p> So, if the screen on your new Galaxy A50 appears too bright, it’s just the way Samsung AMOLED displays work and should look. However, you can still adjust some settings to make the screen more appealing to your eyes. </p>
<p> Just go to settings, and change the screen mode to Basic. Even if you’re not satisfied with the end result, give it some time for your eyes and brain to get accustomed to the new vibrant screen. </p>
<p> That’s about it. If you’ve encountered a problem I didn’t list in this article or you have some additional questions, write it down in the comments below, and we’ll try to find the solution together. </p>

<p> I’ve had A50 for a year of a 2 year contract. A few weeks ago the screen went blank with flashes of colour. There were faint hairline cracks. I took to dealer and paid £110 to fix it assuming I’d broken it. 2 weeks later same problem. I will be seeking a repair refund and new phone. This clearly a fault in design/manufacture. </p>

<p> I’ve had my phone for 4 months and all of a sudden I’m not getting notification sounds on quick text message replies. It’s so frustrating because I have missed some messages! I’ve reset my phone and done everything else, and it still doesn’t work correctly. </p>
<p> I have had the phone for a while and mostly get on with it. My most irritating problem is that the phone keeps switching from portrait to landscape at random times. Any advice on how to stop this please? </p>

<p> I just purchased an A50. So far, I have noticed the following: </p>
<p> 1. While texting, it inadvertently adds random letters in between words, that I know I did not type. Often. </p>
<p> 2. When I click on a you tube video, or other video formats, it is not able to play. The screen goes black and goes into a frantic jerking motion. This issue alone will cause me to return the phone if it can’t be remedied. </p>
<p> I read how yours goes into a frantic, jerky mption. Mine started doing this glitching randomly after only owning it for 9 months. It’s not specific to me searching anything tjough and is happening more frequently noe like everyda. It’s like screen quivers and you cant type or anything,.

<p> Samsung Galaxy A70 common problems and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung has firmly re-entered the midrange segment this year. Users already love the company’s budget champion, the Galaxy A50, and its bigger brother, the A70, only improves on an already strong base. </p>
<p> Sure, the A70 might not be the best value for money in the whole A series, but it offers something authentic. It brings a good portion of the Galaxy Note experience with its huge AMOLED display. Only for the chunk of the price. If you value big phones, but don’t want to spend a small fortune, the Galaxy A70 is a way to go. You probably think the same way, and that’s why you just bought this device. </p>
<p> But then, the first problems start to appear. And there aren’t too many things as annoying as problems on a phone fresh out of the box. That’s why I compiled a list of the most common problems with the Galaxy A70 for you. Just find the issue that’s bothering you, and you’ll either find a solution, or understand the problem better. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Touch screen issues </p>
<p> When the phone’s highlight feature is its display, the last thing you’d want or expect is some screen-related problem. Unfortunately, that appears to be exactly the biggest problem with the A70. Forums are flooded with reports complaining about touch screen issues, of whom the biggest problem appears to be the multi-touch. </p>
<p> Apparently, users are having multi-touch issues in games that use the movement stick, like PUBG. Namely, when you drag the stick to keep moving, it stops registering your finger, so you have to lift it and press the stick again. </p>
<p> I couldn’t find a solution to this problem anywhere. That means Samsung will probably address it in an update. However, there are reports about users already receiving an update that claims to fix the multi-touch issue, but it still persists. </p>
<p> I can only advise you to keep checking for new updates, and hope for the best. Hopefully, Samsung will deal with this problem once and for all in the future. </p>
<p> 2. Wi-Fi problems </p>
<p> One user has reported on Samsung forums that he’s unable to connect to his home Wi-Fi network. Other than that, Wi-Fi doesn’t appear to be the problem on the A70. Nevertheless, if you can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network, make sure everything’s okay with your router first. </p>
<p> If you can’t connect to any Wi-Fi network, try some of the solutions listed in this article. </p>
<p> 3. Overheating issue </p>
<p> Just like the reported Wi-Fi problem, overheating doesn’t appear to be a widespread problem with the Galaxy A70. However, it’s been reported, so I feel like I should include it, anyway. </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing overheating on your brand new Galaxy A70, try some of the following workarounds: </p>
<p> Disable background services, like Bluetooth, NFC, location, etc. </p>
<p> Lower the screen brightness. </p>
<p> Disable the always-on display. </p>
<p> Try a different case. </p>
<p> Install the latest updates. </p>
<p> 4. Fingerprint scanner not working </p>
<p> Another new feature the A series brings to the table is the in-display fingerprint scanner. And once again, the real-life results are great, to say the least. There are numerous reports on the forums about the A70’s fingerprint scanner either being slow or not working at all. </p>
<p> Sure, this is still a first-generation technology, and you shouldn’t expect it to work flawlessly 100% of the time. Plus, the fact that Samsung doesn’t use premium hardware in the A70 doesn’t help. But still, you want it to function to a degree where it’s at least usable. </p>
<p> Some users have reported that the fingerprint scanner started working normally after a few updates. On the other hand, some say the issue persists even on up-to-date devices. So, the only thing left for you, if you’re experiencing the fingerprint scanner issues, is to keep checking for updates and hope for the best. If the problem persists, consider replacing your phone at the store. </p>
<p> 5. Lags while gaming </p>
<p> A few reports suggest that users are expiriencing lags while gaming. Esentially, this is true, but it’s probably not a problem per se. This alleged lagging issue is actually CPU throtthling caused by a high temperature. In case you’re not familiar with the term, when your phone reaches a certain temperature, it automatically “throttles” the speed of both GPU and CPU to prevent overheating. That process is called “throttling”. </p>
<p> So, if you’ve been gaming for an extensive period of time, your phone will reach a certain temperature, and it will throttle the power of your hardware. Which means you’ll have less resources to work with, and your performance will suffer. Especially in more demanding games. </p>
<p> In that manner, if your game starts stuttering, just put your phone down for an hour, and let it cool off. You shouldn’t experience any more lagging problems afterwards. Additionally, this can also happen if your phone already overheats, like mentioned above. In that case, try some of the recommended solutions to prevent overheating. </p>
<p> That’s about it. As you can see, there aren’t too many things to worry about with the A70, which makes this phone a pretty sure bet. Sure, possible touch screen problems could get annoying but you’ll get used to it eventually. And who knows, maybe Samsung will resolve everything with a future update. </p>

<p> I wish I hadn’t bought this phone. They need to do a recall on these phones. </p>
<p> I just got my A70 from Xfinity about a week and a half ago. I experienced the dropped calls problem you describe and called the customer care line. They are aware of the problem and so is Samsung. They are replacing my phone under warranty with an A71. </p>

<p> Huawei P10 Lite common issues, and how to resolve them </p>
<p> Huawei’s enormous growth is well-justified by the devices they delivered in the last few years. It’s only the question of time before they get to contest first place with Apple or Samsung. And latest flagship ”P” handsets are definitely a step forward in many regards. </p>
<p> Even though P10 Lite isn’t on the same level as P10 and P10 plus flagships, it’s an amazing mid-range handset that rewards users with a slick design, great IPS LCD screen and overall above-average performance. It comes with the latest version of Huawei Android variation, EMUI 5.1, and to date, P10 Lite received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, after some time, issues started to pile up. Don’t get us wrong, this is is the case with most other devices and the problems we enlisted below aren’t common and widespread. But, if you have any issues with your latest acquisition, make sure to check the list below and look up for a solution. </p>
<p> Battery drainage </p>
<p> Huawei is not known for fast battery drainage on previous devices, but, it seems that the latest addition to P lite series is somewhat troubled in that regard. With the 3000 mAh, P10 Lite battery doesn’t lack longevity, at least if you’re not an intensive user. Fast charging is a great improvement over P9 and will let you recharge much faster. However, it seems that the EMUI 5.1 kind of drains more battery than EMUI 5.0 and the more demanding screen is a greater consumer, too. </p>
<p> Some users reported that the battery life is underwhelming, so we prepared some tips for you to improve it. If you’re unsure what to do, the steps below should be informative. </p>
<p> Disable power-consuming background apps. You can do that within the Phone Manager > Lock Screen Cleanup. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location Mode, and choose Device only if you’re not in need of GPS’s high accuracy at the moment. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location > 3-dot Menu > Scan settings, and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, respectively. </p>
<p> Reset phone in Safe mode and look for changes. If the battery life is much longer, that would imply that some 3rd-party app is hogging on your battery. Most of the time, the problem is resolved by uninstalling lately installed apps. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Disable Auto brightness and set a preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Slow speed and lag </p>
<p> In the hardware department, P10 Lite is probably one of the best-buy models in the mid-range category. It’s fast and reliable as they come. However, the occasional issues with performance aren’t unusual. Some of them reported freezes after unlocking while others have had experienced performance drops while running some demanding games. </p>
<p> Even the manufacturer said that the eMMC memory instead of faster UFS. That’s just like that. Another thing that might affect performance drops is related to overheating which we will address below. </p>
<p> If you’ve experienced something similar, there are some things you can do to resolve the issue. </p>
<p> Restart your device. If it won’t react to standard Power Off procedure, you can force shut down by holding the Power button long enough. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. Follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Let the phone cool down for a while. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> SIM card issues </p>
<p> Just as the previous iterations in P Lite series, P10 Lite supports either dual-SIM or SIM + SD card variation. Now, it’s not exactly hard to set up preferred cards in the compartment, but there are some things to know. Firstly, only the primary SIM card supports 3G and above technologies. Second is exclusively bound to 2G. So, if you’ve experienced connection losses or a network coverage error, make sure to check which card you use. </p>
<p> In addition, you should double check is everything set as intended before the suspicion of hardware malfunction arises. In addition, you can restart your device and look for changes. After that, you shouldn’t have any problems with the SIM card. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issue </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues were not uncommon for Huawei handsets before, and they are still present for some users of P10 Lite. Some of them reported connectivity issues while trying to pair their phone with the car media board or a wireless headset. For some, the connection is unstable and crashing frequently, while others weren’t able to connect in the first place. Firstly, you must make sure that the P10 Lite is the culprit for the failed pairing. Check connection with multiple devices to make sure that the phone is the problem. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, follow the instructions below to resolve the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Make sure that the Airplane mode is disabled. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Clear pairing and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Try disabling Wi-Fi and Mobile Data while using Bluetooth. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, you should contact your vendor or responsible carrier since the problem is certainly hardware-related. </p>
<p> Fingerprint scanner issues </p>
<p> The fingerprint scanner is more than a useful feature on flagship devices. But, lately, even the mid-range devices are packing reader with a variety of nifty uses. And Huawei is one of the first large manufacturers that started implementing fingerprint reader on the majority of its devices. The scanner on Huawei P10 Lite is just as fast and well-placed like on P9. But, there’s still a problem or two regarding its occasional erratic behavior. </p>
<p> There are some workarounds you can apply before concurring that the hardware is the problem. </p>
<p> Clean your fingerprint scanner. Use a wet cloth to clean the fingerprint scanner of dirt. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable fingerprint gestures. Open Settings > Fingerprint ID, and disable all gestures except the standard unlock feature. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> In the end, if the problem is persistent, contact your vendor or carrier and report the problem. </p>
<p> Volume issues </p>
<p> Certain users reported issues with the sound volume of certain apps notifications and many other aspects, with the exclusion of ringer sound that works as intended. Namely, some of them reported too loud or quiet notifications and other multimedia features. And even though they tried to regulate or even mute the sound, it still remained the same. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to wait for the future update which should resolve the sound bug. Meanwhile, you can use the ”Do not disturb” mode to disable certain sounds. In addition, try some of these workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Boot in safe mode. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC with HiSuite. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> Overheating issues </p>
<p> Another problem that emerged with the introduction of massive hardware improvements is the overheating. And most of the modern smartphones will eventually get hot, but some of them are more prone to it than others. Huawei P10 Lite, for example, is prone to overheating. Especially in the upper back part. Don’t get us wrong, this occurrence requires certain circumstances, like intensive gaming or exposure to the sun for an extended period, or use during charging. </p>
<p> Because of that, make sure to keep your phone far from the heat sources and leave it be while fast charging. In addition, don’t use alternative, commercial chargers instead of the one OEM provided you with. </p>
<p> Moreover, if the device overheating occurs during the idle state or standard use, make sure to take it for repair or ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Besides the Bluetooth issue, there are additional problems that are also related to connectivity. Namely, some users reported poor Wi-Fi signal or constant disconnection while using P10 Lite. In addition, others are experiencing poor connection while using Mobile data. There are so many factors for this occurrence, and many of those are not exclusively phone-related. </p>
<p> We enlisted some of the probable solutions for the problem and you can find them just below. </p>
<p> Mobile Data troubleshooting: </p>
<p> Switch Network type. Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. Go to Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Forget network and re-establish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz. It lacks range, but it’s a more stable option. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition within Recovery settings. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> After that, your connectivity issues should be long gone. In contrary, if those steps failed to resolve the issue at hand, make sure to report the problem to service or to manufacturer support itself. </p>
<p> That should be it. If you have any additional problems or alternative solutions for the ones presented, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Which type of incoming message? Text, Facebook or other. If it’s text and it’s the huawei p10 lite, then while in text screen, click on 3 dots and select settings at the bottom of screen and click on ringtones and vibration and select a ringtone. If that doesn’t work there a little symbol saying restore defaults. That will put everything back to normal. After all is done, turn off your phone and then restart. I hope this helps. </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram Videos Not Playing On Android </p>
<p> Instagram has become an integral part of the ever-growing social networks family. Besides standard photos, you’re also able to share short GIF-like videos. If the picture is worth 1000 words, the video must be worth a bit more, does it? </p>
<p> While Instagram rarely has stability issues, the video playback can get stuck from time to time. Additionally, that can lead to app crash or instability or nervous breakdowns. So, if you are experiencing video issues, you’ve come to the right spot. Let’s try and resolve this issue together and get those videos up and running. </p>
<p> Update Instagram app </p>
<p> The first step you should take is updating your Instagram app. Most of the time, the problem lies in outdated version. Because of that, make sure you have the latest version at any given time. The auto-update should do the job for you, but you can look up for updates manually, too. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Tap Menu. </p>
<p> Look up for Instagram in Update tab. </p>
<p> Choose to update. </p>
<p> Once it’s done, open Instagram and try playing videos. </p>
<p> In case the videos still won’t play, let’s try additional steps. </p>
<p> Clear Instagram app cache and data </p>
<p> As same as the most of the apps do, Instagram stores a lot of data on your phone. With particular settings, every picture or video you post can be preserved on the phone storage or SD card. Moreover, there’s a lot of cache files that may slow down the app gradually and impact video playback. </p>
<p> According to that, your next step should be clearing cache and data from the Instagram app. Follow these instructions to clear Data and Cache. </p>
<p> Clear Cache and Data. </p>
<p> Some users use specific apps for automatic clearing of cache. However, we advise you not to use them. Firstly, they take your storage space, and secondly, they tend to work in the background and slow down all-around performance. Simply put, that kind of apps are more disadvantage than a valid tool. </p>
<p> Reinstall Instagram </p>
<p> Sometimes the apps may stuck because of some kind of the corruption. Software sometimes has a mind of its own and the only viable solution is reinstallation. So, if you’ve tried previous steps and the videos still won’t load, try this out. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Most of the time, this should resolve your issue. Of course, if the software is an issue. However, sometimes the connection may play the main part in this Instagram wrongdoings. Move on to the next step to troubleshoot the connection. </p>
<p> Restart Wi-Fi router </p>
<p> Some users reported on various forums that the Instagram videos work on Wi-Fi but won’t work on mobile data and vice versa. So, the first step is to restart your Wi-Fi router. Turn it off, wait a minute or so, and then turn it on. </p>
<p> Additionally, you may want to update router firmware and change from 5 GHz band to 2.4 GHz. Even though the 5 GHz supports higher speeds, it’s signal isn’t as reliable as 2.4 GHz over distance. That, of course, is not an issue with dual-band routers. </p>
<p> Reset your Network settings </p>
<p> Once you’ve tweaked your router, let’s reset network settings on the phone. That should fix common connection bugs and let you start from the scratch. Have in mind that you’ll need to reestablish the settings again. </p>
<p> Choose Network Settings Reset. </p>
<p> Tap RESET SETTINGS. </p>
<p> Turn off Power-saving mode </p>
<p> Thanks to one of our readers, we obtained another workaround that just may be the one that resolves the problem. He resolved the problem by disabling the Power-saving mode, that somehow interferes with the Instagram videos playback. So, navigate to Power settings, disable Power-saving mode and your problem should be sorted out. </p>
<p> Thanks a lot to Matt that suggested this solution. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. In case you have any additional problems with Instagram, please be free to tell us in the comments, or reach us out on Twitter. We’ll do our best to help you resolve them. </p>

<p> I have just moved to Android. I thought it was my connection or LET. But in this case it was the cache. So I have to do it constantly? If yes I already miss IOs </p>

<p> I finally got it to work. I got a galaxy note5 and for a past week been having the same problem as you all. I just got it to work. I went to the app settings and cleared data and cache then I manually gave permission to use your phone. Restarted the phone and after signing in again BOOM!!!! Instagram vids played tested and happy with results. Maybe the last update to android turned all permissions off? </p>

<p> I was having this issue on my S8 but turning off power saving mode fixed it. I feel dumb because before you turn it on, it tells you all the things it’ll prevent lol. Thanks for this article! </p>

<p> I keep getting this error “there was an issue importing your video. Please try again.” I’ve made sure I exported my video with the right settings. It works fine on my mum LG G3, but not on my Samsung s6. I’ve also tried it on a S7 Edge and it has the same error. Does anyone know how to fix this? </p>

<p> I signed into Instagram through Chrome. All my videos are working just fine. Since the problem only occurs with the Instagram app (updated and cache cleared), I am assuming the issue is between the app and my phone LGG4. It was great to see my videos working again. 🙂 </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> Lock screen issue iPhone 5s 11.1.2 lock screen gets stuck in landscape mode. Annoying af. Ugh and battery life doesn’t exist n e more. Maybe a hr or so. Come on apple step ur game up. </p>

<p> Iphone 7 that is only 6 months old (if that). – upgraded to the new iOS last night and since then my phone has been an absolute sack of shit. Was fully charged this morning, and now at 9:42am I have 40% (and has been sitting in idle majority of that time). The other issue I’ve been having is every few minutes my screen goes black then gives me that little white loading circle, then comes back. This is INCREDIBLY frustrating, as whenever I am trying to do ANYTHING on my phone I am interrupted with my phone essentially restarting… Read more » </p>

<p> I have an iPhone 6s Plus and since the update , my phone gets a black screen and spinning wheel like it’s powering off . It only goes as far as closing any app I have open and then returns to a locked home screen. No apple logo or restart needed. It’s happened twice while writing this. </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> Huawei Honor 8 most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei has gained a lot of popularity lately with both Mate (flagship) and Honor (mid-range) series. Honor 8 is the latest addition to the list of mid-budget devices produced by the Chinese company. Upon presentation for the US and EU market, the phone received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, even though Honor 8 offers good performance for an affordable price, there are some common issues worth mentioning. Users reported various problems with both hardware and software. It seems that the producer addressed some of the problems, but there is a large number of those that they need to resolve. Today we listed for you the known issues and possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Video crash while playing </p>
<p> As some of the users stated, the Honor 8 have a lot of issues with the video playback or streaming. It seems that the video crashes and, on some occasion, a restart is the only solution to get things work again. According to them, the crash occurs in online or offline videos, regardless. On the other hand, the fundament of the problem is YouTube. </p>
<p> We have noticed that the problem is widespread and the main culprit is integration with third-party apps. For the standard videos, first and foremost is to check the format. Honor 8 supports these video formats: </p>
<p> WMV </p>
<p> RM </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the online streaming videos are the ones with issues, make sure that you reinstall the given app or try an alternative. It seems that the Honor 8 have a certain level off incompatibility with some of them. Additionally, if the problem is persistent, you should contact customers support and ask for a replace. </p>
<p> Video recording stutter in third-party apps </p>
<p> While this is not as crushing (no pun intended) as the previous issue, it can be as annoying. Namely, many users reported lag and stutter while recording videos on Snapchat or Instagram story. This often leads to unsynchronized audio and video. </p>
<p> This seems to be related to awkward camera overheating. You should check the top of your phone for temperature changes. If the phone’s temperature is normal, try restarting your phone and clearing the app cache and data. Moreover, you can check your battery temperature by typing this code in your dialer *#*#2846579#*#*. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the phone is overheated (and that seems to happen often with some users), you’ll have to let it cool down. The camera behavior is not a strong feature of this model since the following default software is underwhelming. We’ll have to wait and see are there any fixes prepared in the next update build. </p>
<p> 3G works instead LTE, WiFI won’t connect </p>
<p> Connectivity is a common issue with the Honor 8. A large number of users reported problems related both to Wi-Fi and data networks. The phone won’t connect to a known network for ages or it chooses 3G instead of much faster LTE. </p>
<p> You can try following workarounds for data network issue: </p>
<p> Switch Network type: Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings: Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and reestablish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> The Huawei confirmed that they are aware of the Wi-Fi issue. We can hope that they’ll fix it with the next patch. </p>
<p> Echo while calling </p>
<p> Some users reported a problem with in-call speaker and mic malfunction. According to them, they hear the echo while speaking on the phone. The issue is more present when the loudspeaker is ON. </p>
<p> This is a common issue with many Android-powered phones. Most of the time it is related to pre-installed Google app called TalkBack. Our advice is to turn it off. </p>
<p> No battery percentage was shown </p>
<p> Honor 8 isn’t presenting battery percentage on the home screen by default. Most of the users are accustomed to that feature and they want to enable it but don’t know how. And this is the simplest way: </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon. </p>
<p> In the upper right corner, you’ll see 3 icons. </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon that is in the middle. </p>
<p> Notifications are not displayed when screen is off </p>
<p> Some of the users were left in disbelief when their push notifications from various apps stopped. It can be a quite annoying experience that ruins all-around impression about the phone. Which is pretty great in all manners. </p>
<p> Huawei made a strange decision to improve battery life by completely disabling the notifications while the screen is off. Luckily, that can be changed in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Protected apps. </p>
<p> Add apps that you want to receive notifications from. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this article helpful. Additionally, we are sure that the phone will function much better once it gets updated to Nougat 7.0. The update cycle started on 10th February so be sure to check your phones. </p>
<p> Are you experiencing any other issues? Be sure to tell us and we’ll give our best to help you. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> My Honor 8 is 7 months old and of late I am seeing that the volume level on the phone is very low… The settings show max volume. But i can’t hear often and even youtube videos volume is very low.. Forced me to carry my headphones all the time with me. Please let me know if there is any fix or settings changes </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> Clearing cache in recovery mode has continued to work well for me anytime an update slows my N5x down and did so after getting the push notification for Oreo update. YMMV </p>
<p> The Skia change did nothing, but this worked purrrfectly! Thank you!!!! Now I just need to remember it for next time. </p>
<p> My Nexus 5x was working fine until I updated, now it is very slow. Most noticable is switching between apps. running/using an app still works fine though. Also, opening the camera takes a long time and when going to video mode half the screen goes black for a rather long time. The performance after the update is in other words very bad. Saw that others have done a roll-back which is what I will do aswell. </p>

<p> I had Oreo on my 5x for two days. Super laggy, despite the “fix”. Just unenrolled from the beta and back to 7.1.2. Much better. </p>

<p> They don’t want you being able to use your 2 yr old phone for any longer than possible. </p>
<p> I had the same problem as other have reported. </p>
<p> I also changed to Skia a few days ago but when I checked again today it had changed back. Possibly because there was a security update that I installed yesterday tho, but it’s still annoyingly slow. </p>

<p> I dealt with this on my Nexus 5x and none of the fixes helped. The most annoying was that the camera took about 15 seconds to open up. Also an evident general battery drain. I tried to unenroll because I got Oreo on beta but apparently I was already off beta so there was no stable update back to Nougat. Instructions to downgrade to Nougat are intense. Last ditch effort I did a hard reset … And all is good! I also made the setting change in this article but don’t know if it’s necessary or not. Not it’s night… Read more » </p>

<p> Here is the real fix: reboot to recovery mode, then wipe your cache partition. You’re welcome 😉 </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram Videos Not Playing On Android </p>
<p> Instagram has become an integral part of the ever-growing social networks family. Besides standard photos, you’re also able to share short GIF-like videos. If the picture is worth 1000 words, the video must be worth a bit more, does it? </p>
<p> While Instagram rarely has stability issues, the video playback can get stuck from time to time. Additionally, that can lead to app crash or instability or nervous breakdowns. So, if you are experiencing video issues, you’ve come to the right spot. Let’s try and resolve this issue together and get those videos up and running. </p>
<p> Update Instagram app </p>
<p> The first step you should take is updating your Instagram app. Most of the time, the problem lies in outdated version. Because of that, make sure you have the latest version at any given time. The auto-update should do the job for you, but you can look up for updates manually, too. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Tap Menu. </p>
<p> Look up for Instagram in Update tab. </p>
<p> Choose to update. </p>
<p> Once it’s done, open Instagram and try playing videos. </p>
<p> In case the videos still won’t play, let’s try additional steps. </p>
<p> Clear Instagram app cache and data </p>
<p> As same as the most of the apps do, Instagram stores a lot of data on your phone. With particular settings, every picture or video you post can be preserved on the phone storage or SD card. Moreover, there’s a lot of cache files that may slow down the app gradually and impact video playback. </p>
<p> According to that, your next step should be clearing cache and data from the Instagram app. Follow these instructions to clear Data and Cache. </p>
<p> Clear Cache and Data. </p>
<p> Some users use specific apps for automatic clearing of cache. However, we advise you not to use them. Firstly, they take your storage space, and secondly, they tend to work in the background and slow down all-around performance. Simply put, that kind of apps are more disadvantage than a valid tool. </p>
<p> Reinstall Instagram </p>
<p> Sometimes the apps may stuck because of some kind of the corruption. Software sometimes has a mind of its own and the only viable solution is reinstallation. So, if you’ve tried previous steps and the videos still won’t load, try this out. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Most of the time, this should resolve your issue. Of course, if the software is an issue. However, sometimes the connection may play the main part in this Instagram wrongdoings. Move on to the next step to troubleshoot the connection. </p>
<p> Restart Wi-Fi router </p>
<p> Some users reported on various forums that the Instagram videos work on Wi-Fi but won’t work on mobile data and vice versa. So, the first step is to restart your Wi-Fi router. Turn it off, wait a minute or so, and then turn it on. </p>
<p> Additionally, you may want to update router firmware and change from 5 GHz band to 2.4 GHz. Even though the 5 GHz supports higher speeds, it’s signal isn’t as reliable as 2.4 GHz over distance. That, of course, is not an issue with dual-band routers. </p>
<p> Reset your Network settings </p>
<p> Once you’ve tweaked your router, let’s reset network settings on the phone. That should fix common connection bugs and let you start from the scratch. Have in mind that you’ll need to reestablish the settings again. </p>
<p> Choose Network Settings Reset. </p>
<p> Tap RESET SETTINGS. </p>
<p> Turn off Power-saving mode </p>
<p> Thanks to one of our readers, we obtained another workaround that just may be the one that resolves the problem. He resolved the problem by disabling the Power-saving mode, that somehow interferes with the Instagram videos playback. So, navigate to Power settings, disable Power-saving mode and your problem should be sorted out. </p>
<p> Thanks a lot to Matt that suggested this solution. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. In case you have any additional problems with Instagram, please be free to tell us in the comments, or reach us out on Twitter. We’ll do our best to help you resolve them. </p>

<p> I’m not having issues with other peoples videos but only one video of mine that I uploaded. I uploaded it on the multiple feature with the video first and photos after. It played the first day and hasn’t played since. I’ve tried everything to fix it but nothing seems to work. Any ideas? Is it because I deleted the actual video from my phone? </p>

<p> Huawei P10 Lite common issues, and how to resolve them </p>
<p> Huawei’s enormous growth is well-justified by the devices they delivered in the last few years. It’s only the question of time before they get to contest first place with Apple or Samsung. And latest flagship ”P” handsets are definitely a step forward in many regards. </p>
<p> Even though P10 Lite isn’t on the same level as P10 and P10 plus flagships, it’s an amazing mid-range handset that rewards users with a slick design, great IPS LCD screen and overall above-average performance. It comes with the latest version of Huawei Android variation, EMUI 5.1, and to date, P10 Lite received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, after some time, issues started to pile up. Don’t get us wrong, this is is the case with most other devices and the problems we enlisted below aren’t common and widespread. But, if you have any issues with your latest acquisition, make sure to check the list below and look up for a solution. </p>
<p> Battery drainage </p>
<p> Huawei is not known for fast battery drainage on previous devices, but, it seems that the latest addition to P lite series is somewhat troubled in that regard. With the 3000 mAh, P10 Lite battery doesn’t lack longevity, at least if you’re not an intensive user. Fast charging is a great improvement over P9 and will let you recharge much faster. However, it seems that the EMUI 5.1 kind of drains more battery than EMUI 5.0 and the more demanding screen is a greater consumer, too. </p>
<p> Some users reported that the battery life is underwhelming, so we prepared some tips for you to improve it. If you’re unsure what to do, the steps below should be informative. </p>
<p> Disable power-consuming background apps. You can do that within the Phone Manager > Lock Screen Cleanup. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location Mode, and choose Device only if you’re not in need of GPS’s high accuracy at the moment. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location > 3-dot Menu > Scan settings, and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, respectively. </p>
<p> Reset phone in Safe mode and look for changes. If the battery life is much longer, that would imply that some 3rd-party app is hogging on your battery. Most of the time, the problem is resolved by uninstalling lately installed apps. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Disable Auto brightness and set a preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Slow speed and lag </p>
<p> In the hardware department, P10 Lite is probably one of the best-buy models in the mid-range category. It’s fast and reliable as they come. However, the occasional issues with performance aren’t unusual. Some of them reported freezes after unlocking while others have had experienced performance drops while running some demanding games. </p>
<p> Even the manufacturer said that the eMMC memory instead of faster UFS. That’s just like that. Another thing that might affect performance drops is related to overheating which we will address below. </p>
<p> If you’ve experienced something similar, there are some things you can do to resolve the issue. </p>
<p> Restart your device. If it won’t react to standard Power Off procedure, you can force shut down by holding the Power button long enough. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. Follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Let the phone cool down for a while. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> SIM card issues </p>
<p> Just as the previous iterations in P Lite series, P10 Lite supports either dual-SIM or SIM + SD card variation. Now, it’s not exactly hard to set up preferred cards in the compartment, but there are some things to know. Firstly, only the primary SIM card supports 3G and above technologies. Second is exclusively bound to 2G. So, if you’ve experienced connection losses or a network coverage error, make sure to check which card you use. </p>
<p> In addition, you should double check is everything set as intended before the suspicion of hardware malfunction arises. In addition, you can restart your device and look for changes. After that, you shouldn’t have any problems with the SIM card. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issue </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues were not uncommon for Huawei handsets before, and they are still present for some users of P10 Lite. Some of them reported connectivity issues while trying to pair their phone with the car media board or a wireless headset. For some, the connection is unstable and crashing frequently, while others weren’t able to connect in the first place. Firstly, you must make sure that the P10 Lite is the culprit for the failed pairing. Check connection with multiple devices to make sure that the phone is the problem. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, follow the instructions below to resolve the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Make sure that the Airplane mode is disabled. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Clear pairing and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Try disabling Wi-Fi and Mobile Data while using Bluetooth. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, you should contact your vendor or responsible carrier since the problem is certainly hardware-related. </p>
<p> Fingerprint scanner issues </p>
<p> The fingerprint scanner is more than a useful feature on flagship devices. But, lately, even the mid-range devices are packing reader with a variety of nifty uses. And Huawei is one of the first large manufacturers that started implementing fingerprint reader on the majority of its devices. The scanner on Huawei P10 Lite is just as fast and well-placed like on P9. But, there’s still a problem or two regarding its occasional erratic behavior. </p>
<p> There are some workarounds you can apply before concurring that the hardware is the problem. </p>
<p> Clean your fingerprint scanner. Use a wet cloth to clean the fingerprint scanner of dirt. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable fingerprint gestures. Open Settings > Fingerprint ID, and disable all gestures except the standard unlock feature. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> In the end, if the problem is persistent, contact your vendor or carrier and report the problem. </p>
<p> Volume issues </p>
<p> Certain users reported issues with the sound volume of certain apps notifications and many other aspects, with the exclusion of ringer sound that works as intended. Namely, some of them reported too loud or quiet notifications and other multimedia features. And even though they tried to regulate or even mute the sound, it still remained the same. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to wait for the future update which should resolve the sound bug. Meanwhile, you can use the ”Do not disturb” mode to disable certain sounds. In addition, try some of these workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Boot in safe mode. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC with HiSuite. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> Overheating issues </p>
<p> Another problem that emerged with the introduction of massive hardware improvements is the overheating. And most of the modern smartphones will eventually get hot, but some of them are more prone to it than others. Huawei P10 Lite, for example, is prone to overheating. Especially in the upper back part. Don’t get us wrong, this occurrence requires certain circumstances, like intensive gaming or exposure to the sun for an extended period, or use during charging. </p>
<p> Because of that, make sure to keep your phone far from the heat sources and leave it be while fast charging. In addition, don’t use alternative, commercial chargers instead of the one OEM provided you with. </p>
<p> Moreover, if the device overheating occurs during the idle state or standard use, make sure to take it for repair or ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Besides the Bluetooth issue, there are additional problems that are also related to connectivity. Namely, some users reported poor Wi-Fi signal or constant disconnection while using P10 Lite. In addition, others are experiencing poor connection while using Mobile data. There are so many factors for this occurrence, and many of those are not exclusively phone-related. </p>
<p> We enlisted some of the probable solutions for the problem and you can find them just below. </p>
<p> Mobile Data troubleshooting: </p>
<p> Switch Network type. Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. Go to Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Forget network and re-establish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz. It lacks range, but it’s a more stable option. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition within Recovery settings. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> After that, your connectivity issues should be long gone. In contrary, if those steps failed to resolve the issue at hand, make sure to report the problem to service or to manufacturer support itself. </p>
<p> That should be it. If you have any additional problems or alternative solutions for the ones presented, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>
<p> Do you get a response on screen or little symbol at the top? If so, swipe down from the top and if you see a message notification, press and hold and an a small menu will pop up giving you options. You can silence and block the app and sound and vibrate. Hope this helps. </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> My IPhone 6S started to randomly playing the charge sound approximately 5 to 10 times every day – without connection to the charger. This began after updating to 11.1.2.. </p>

<p> I have a Iphone 6+. my music app that come with the i phone keeps popping up on the screen and is useless. You can’t close it. It will play music that I have downloaded or purchased. Siri is slow to activate but that was from the update of 11. I’m not going to even try to update the ipad. Even people at apple could not get i to stay closed. (not the techs at the store, just people who worked there). </p>

<p> My iPad Pro will not let me re-arrange apps. The screen flashes and the apps literally jump out of folders. When I try to get them back in the folder does the magnet repel thing. Rebooting does not solve the problem. The screen brightness lowers itself automatically. You can see the brightness contro moving itself even though is is not on auto-levels etc. The battery drain is dramatic as well. Where is any QC at Apple? </p>

<p> December 16, 2017. Since putting 11.0 on my iPhone 6, battery drainage is ridiculous. Going to bed with it at 100%, all apps closed. Wake up to 55%. Last night I downloaded the latest, 11.2.1, in hopes of a fix. No luck. I am really starting to believe the rumors that Apple purposely does these things to force people to buy new phones after a certain length of time. I have been to 3 Apple Genius bars to no avail. Battery tested 3 times and it is fine. Every single help suggestion advises turning off certain settings, etc. Well, sounds… Read more » </p>

<p> Ruined my iPad to upgrade to the 11.1.2 Freezes when trying to text a picture. Requires 3 steps to take a screenshot. Caused several of my apps to be useless because they are not supported. Hate this update. Should never have trusted Apple. </p>

<p> Same issue. Mine flashes or lights up but no alert. When I open the messages, still doesn’t show. Then it crashes and upon opening the second time, the messages are there and it is usable. This tends to make the phone run hot and the batttery drains really quick. Rebooting doesn’t help </p>

<p> After updating my iPhone 7 Plus to iOS 11.1.2 and using it for few days I’ve found that the battery drain is more quickly than the iOS 10.3.3. But I think user face this problem only in beta version. And I would personally turn off Bluetooth and Wifi when not in use. </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> My ASUS Zenphone stopped functioning since rainwater leaked into my phone pocket a week ago. My attempt to switch off failed, and, couldn’t force stop as well due to locked battery. Due to fluctuating charge of the wet battery, the initially display brightened abnormally and, finally, stopped. I kept the set dry 48 hours , then fully recharged. Again, there is no display at all. It vibrates while receiving calls, but I can’t receive the call because complete darkness on the screen. Kindly advise whether I can restore the display in my set again? </p>

<p> Huawei Honor 8 most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei has gained a lot of popularity lately with both Mate (flagship) and Honor (mid-range) series. Honor 8 is the latest addition to the list of mid-budget devices produced by the Chinese company. Upon presentation for the US and EU market, the phone received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, even though Honor 8 offers good performance for an affordable price, there are some common issues worth mentioning. Users reported various problems with both hardware and software. It seems that the producer addressed some of the problems, but there is a large number of those that they need to resolve. Today we listed for you the known issues and possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Video crash while playing </p>
<p> As some of the users stated, the Honor 8 have a lot of issues with the video playback or streaming. It seems that the video crashes and, on some occasion, a restart is the only solution to get things work again. According to them, the crash occurs in online or offline videos, regardless. On the other hand, the fundament of the problem is YouTube. </p>
<p> We have noticed that the problem is widespread and the main culprit is integration with third-party apps. For the standard videos, first and foremost is to check the format. Honor 8 supports these video formats: </p>
<p> WMV </p>
<p> RM </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the online streaming videos are the ones with issues, make sure that you reinstall the given app or try an alternative. It seems that the Honor 8 have a certain level off incompatibility with some of them. Additionally, if the problem is persistent, you should contact customers support and ask for a replace. </p>
<p> Video recording stutter in third-party apps </p>
<p> While this is not as crushing (no pun intended) as the previous issue, it can be as annoying. Namely, many users reported lag and stutter while recording videos on Snapchat or Instagram story. This often leads to unsynchronized audio and video. </p>
<p> This seems to be related to awkward camera overheating. You should check the top of your phone for temperature changes. If the phone’s temperature is normal, try restarting your phone and clearing the app cache and data. Moreover, you can check your battery temperature by typing this code in your dialer *#*#2846579#*#*. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the phone is overheated (and that seems to happen often with some users), you’ll have to let it cool down. The camera behavior is not a strong feature of this model since the following default software is underwhelming. We’ll have to wait and see are there any fixes prepared in the next update build. </p>
<p> 3G works instead LTE, WiFI won’t connect </p>
<p> Connectivity is a common issue with the Honor 8. A large number of users reported problems related both to Wi-Fi and data networks. The phone won’t connect to a known network for ages or it chooses 3G instead of much faster LTE. </p>
<p> You can try following workarounds for data network issue: </p>
<p> Switch Network type: Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings: Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and reestablish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> The Huawei confirmed that they are aware of the Wi-Fi issue. We can hope that they’ll fix it with the next patch. </p>
<p> Echo while calling </p>
<p> Some users reported a problem with in-call speaker and mic malfunction. According to them, they hear the echo while speaking on the phone. The issue is more present when the loudspeaker is ON. </p>
<p> This is a common issue with many Android-powered phones. Most of the time it is related to pre-installed Google app called TalkBack. Our advice is to turn it off. </p>
<p> No battery percentage was shown </p>
<p> Honor 8 isn’t presenting battery percentage on the home screen by default. Most of the users are accustomed to that feature and they want to enable it but don’t know how. And this is the simplest way: </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon. </p>
<p> In the upper right corner, you’ll see 3 icons. </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon that is in the middle. </p>
<p> Notifications are not displayed when screen is off </p>
<p> Some of the users were left in disbelief when their push notifications from various apps stopped. It can be a quite annoying experience that ruins all-around impression about the phone. Which is pretty great in all manners. </p>
<p> Huawei made a strange decision to improve battery life by completely disabling the notifications while the screen is off. Luckily, that can be changed in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Protected apps. </p>
<p> Add apps that you want to receive notifications from. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this article helpful. Additionally, we are sure that the phone will function much better once it gets updated to Nougat 7.0. The update cycle started on 10th February so be sure to check your phones. </p>
<p> Are you experiencing any other issues? Be sure to tell us and we’ll give our best to help you. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> By far the most irritating thing about this phone (other than the bloat!!!) is the “smart” unlock. For some reason, you can have it unlocked when paired with one (or more) bluetooth products, but NOT your home WiFi. This seems to go against the battery-conservation efforts of Huawei, but it is just silly for me… maybe if you have a smart watch or something it is fine, but I’m constantly turning off the d*$% lock at home for no reason at all. Additionally, while the word all over the internet is that rooting your phone or installing an alternative firmware… Read more » </p>

<p> I’m currently facing the same problem too, did you solve it, and if you did’ then how? </p>
<p> When plugged in with headphones (via jack, bluetooth, wifi,.. anything) Honor 8 uses a chimed DING sound for notifications. I just bought an expensive handsfree earpiece and that chime sound almost destroyed my eardrums. (Since Huawei won’t probably do a thing to fix this, I’ll just try to get my money back by returning the headsets…) </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> Omg I’m so glad I found this thread. My phone is super slow and laggy after the Oreo update. Has been about a month or so now since I updated it. It’s TERRIBLE!!! Forget trying to snapchat, hardly works anymore. Keyboards take forever to pop up, apps take way too long to open. HELP!!!!! </p>

<p> I also update my Nexus 5X with Android Oreo, and I also have a big problem with battery drain issue. My phone is getting hot and only show 5 hours to go after fully charged. A factory reset didn’t help me. In the setting menu, I can’t find any app who need much energy. </p>
<p> thank you I knew that Oreo cause that problem this is great. </p>

<p> My Oreo on Nexus 5X is working awesome. That’s after few changes 1. Make developer option enabled 2. On dev options go to — window animation scale and change to .5x — transition animation scale and change to .5x — animator duration scale and change to .5x 3. If you want, change the OpenGL to Skia (not really needed, but you can if you want) 4. Restart the device in recovery mode and clear cache…. </p>

<p> I just updated my Nexus 5x to Oreo and am having the same problem. It’s a noticeable decrease in performance. Switching back from OpenGPL did not help much for me, so I guess it’s time to roll back. </p>

<p> Huawei P10 Lite common issues, and how to resolve them </p>
<p> Huawei’s enormous growth is well-justified by the devices they delivered in the last few years. It’s only the question of time before they get to contest first place with Apple or Samsung. And latest flagship ”P” handsets are definitely a step forward in many regards. </p>
<p> Even though P10 Lite isn’t on the same level as P10 and P10 plus flagships, it’s an amazing mid-range handset that rewards users with a slick design, great IPS LCD screen and overall above-average performance. It comes with the latest version of Huawei Android variation, EMUI 5.1, and to date, P10 Lite received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, after some time, issues started to pile up. Don’t get us wrong, this is is the case with most other devices and the problems we enlisted below aren’t common and widespread. But, if you have any issues with your latest acquisition, make sure to check the list below and look up for a solution. </p>
<p> Battery drainage </p>
<p> Huawei is not known for fast battery drainage on previous devices, but, it seems that the latest addition to P lite series is somewhat troubled in that regard. With the 3000 mAh, P10 Lite battery doesn’t lack longevity, at least if you’re not an intensive user. Fast charging is a great improvement over P9 and will let you recharge much faster. However, it seems that the EMUI 5.1 kind of drains more battery than EMUI 5.0 and the more demanding screen is a greater consumer, too. </p>
<p> Some users reported that the battery life is underwhelming, so we prepared some tips for you to improve it. If you’re unsure what to do, the steps below should be informative. </p>
<p> Disable power-consuming background apps. You can do that within the Phone Manager > Lock Screen Cleanup. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location Mode, and choose Device only if you’re not in need of GPS’s high accuracy at the moment. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location > 3-dot Menu > Scan settings, and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, respectively. </p>
<p> Reset phone in Safe mode and look for changes. If the battery life is much longer, that would imply that some 3rd-party app is hogging on your battery. Most of the time, the problem is resolved by uninstalling lately installed apps. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Disable Auto brightness and set a preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Slow speed and lag </p>
<p> In the hardware department, P10 Lite is probably one of the best-buy models in the mid-range category. It’s fast and reliable as they come. However, the occasional issues with performance aren’t unusual. Some of them reported freezes after unlocking while others have had experienced performance drops while running some demanding games. </p>
<p> Even the manufacturer said that the eMMC memory instead of faster UFS. That’s just like that. Another thing that might affect performance drops is related to overheating which we will address below. </p>
<p> If you’ve experienced something similar, there are some things you can do to resolve the issue. </p>
<p> Restart your device. If it won’t react to standard Power Off procedure, you can force shut down by holding the Power button long enough. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. Follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Let the phone cool down for a while. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> SIM card issues </p>
<p> Just as the previous iterations in P Lite series, P10 Lite supports either dual-SIM or SIM + SD card variation. Now, it’s not exactly hard to set up preferred cards in the compartment, but there are some things to know. Firstly, only the primary SIM card supports 3G and above technologies. Second is exclusively bound to 2G. So, if you’ve experienced connection losses or a network coverage error, make sure to check which card you use. </p>
<p> In addition, you should double check is everything set as intended before the suspicion of hardware malfunction arises. In addition, you can restart your device and look for changes. After that, you shouldn’t have any problems with the SIM card. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issue </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues were not uncommon for Huawei handsets before, and they are still present for some users of P10 Lite. Some of them reported connectivity issues while trying to pair their phone with the car media board or a wireless headset. For some, the connection is unstable and crashing frequently, while others weren’t able to connect in the first place. Firstly, you must make sure that the P10 Lite is the culprit for the failed pairing. Check connection with multiple devices to make sure that the phone is the problem. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, follow the instructions below to resolve the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Make sure that the Airplane mode is disabled. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Clear pairing and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Try disabling Wi-Fi and Mobile Data while using Bluetooth. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, you should contact your vendor or responsible carrier since the problem is certainly hardware-related. </p>
<p> Fingerprint scanner issues </p>
<p> The fingerprint scanner is more than a useful feature on flagship devices. But, lately, even the mid-range devices are packing reader with a variety of nifty uses. And Huawei is one of the first large manufacturers that started implementing fingerprint reader on the majority of its devices. The scanner on Huawei P10 Lite is just as fast and well-placed like on P9. But, there’s still a problem or two regarding its occasional erratic behavior. </p>
<p> There are some workarounds you can apply before concurring that the hardware is the problem. </p>
<p> Clean your fingerprint scanner. Use a wet cloth to clean the fingerprint scanner of dirt. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable fingerprint gestures. Open Settings > Fingerprint ID, and disable all gestures except the standard unlock feature. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> In the end, if the problem is persistent, contact your vendor or carrier and report the problem. </p>
<p> Volume issues </p>
<p> Certain users reported issues with the sound volume of certain apps notifications and many other aspects, with the exclusion of ringer sound that works as intended. Namely, some of them reported too loud or quiet notifications and other multimedia features. And even though they tried to regulate or even mute the sound, it still remained the same. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to wait for the future update which should resolve the sound bug. Meanwhile, you can use the ”Do not disturb” mode to disable certain sounds. In addition, try some of these workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Boot in safe mode. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC with HiSuite. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> Overheating issues </p>
<p> Another problem that emerged with the introduction of massive hardware improvements is the overheating. And most of the modern smartphones will eventually get hot, but some of them are more prone to it than others. Huawei P10 Lite, for example, is prone to overheating. Especially in the upper back part. Don’t get us wrong, this occurrence requires certain circumstances, like intensive gaming or exposure to the sun for an extended period, or use during charging. </p>
<p> Because of that, make sure to keep your phone far from the heat sources and leave it be while fast charging. In addition, don’t use alternative, commercial chargers instead of the one OEM provided you with. </p>
<p> Moreover, if the device overheating occurs during the idle state or standard use, make sure to take it for repair or ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Besides the Bluetooth issue, there are additional problems that are also related to connectivity. Namely, some users reported poor Wi-Fi signal or constant disconnection while using P10 Lite. In addition, others are experiencing poor connection while using Mobile data. There are so many factors for this occurrence, and many of those are not exclusively phone-related. </p>
<p> We enlisted some of the probable solutions for the problem and you can find them just below. </p>
<p> Mobile Data troubleshooting: </p>
<p> Switch Network type. Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. Go to Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Forget network and re-establish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz. It lacks range, but it’s a more stable option. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition within Recovery settings. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> After that, your connectivity issues should be long gone. In contrary, if those steps failed to resolve the issue at hand, make sure to report the problem to service or to manufacturer support itself. </p>
<p> That should be it. If you have any additional problems or alternative solutions for the ones presented, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram Videos Not Playing On Android </p>
<p> Instagram has become an integral part of the ever-growing social networks family. Besides standard photos, you’re also able to share short GIF-like videos. If the picture is worth 1000 words, the video must be worth a bit more, does it? </p>
<p> While Instagram rarely has stability issues, the video playback can get stuck from time to time. Additionally, that can lead to app crash or instability or nervous breakdowns. So, if you are experiencing video issues, you’ve come to the right spot. Let’s try and resolve this issue together and get those videos up and running. </p>
<p> Update Instagram app </p>
<p> The first step you should take is updating your Instagram app. Most of the time, the problem lies in outdated version. Because of that, make sure you have the latest version at any given time. The auto-update should do the job for you, but you can look up for updates manually, too. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Tap Menu. </p>
<p> Look up for Instagram in Update tab. </p>
<p> Choose to update. </p>
<p> Once it’s done, open Instagram and try playing videos. </p>
<p> In case the videos still won’t play, let’s try additional steps. </p>
<p> Clear Instagram app cache and data </p>
<p> As same as the most of the apps do, Instagram stores a lot of data on your phone. With particular settings, every picture or video you post can be preserved on the phone storage or SD card. Moreover, there’s a lot of cache files that may slow down the app gradually and impact video playback. </p>
<p> According to that, your next step should be clearing cache and data from the Instagram app. Follow these instructions to clear Data and Cache. </p>
<p> Clear Cache and Data. </p>
<p> Some users use specific apps for automatic clearing of cache. However, we advise you not to use them. Firstly, they take your storage space, and secondly, they tend to work in the background and slow down all-around performance. Simply put, that kind of apps are more disadvantage than a valid tool. </p>
<p> Reinstall Instagram </p>
<p> Sometimes the apps may stuck because of some kind of the corruption. Software sometimes has a mind of its own and the only viable solution is reinstallation. So, if you’ve tried previous steps and the videos still won’t load, try this out. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Most of the time, this should resolve your issue. Of course, if the software is an issue. However, sometimes the connection may play the main part in this Instagram wrongdoings. Move on to the next step to troubleshoot the connection. </p>
<p> Restart Wi-Fi router </p>
<p> Some users reported on various forums that the Instagram videos work on Wi-Fi but won’t work on mobile data and vice versa. So, the first step is to restart your Wi-Fi router. Turn it off, wait a minute or so, and then turn it on. </p>
<p> Additionally, you may want to update router firmware and change from 5 GHz band to 2.4 GHz. Even though the 5 GHz supports higher speeds, it’s signal isn’t as reliable as 2.4 GHz over distance. That, of course, is not an issue with dual-band routers. </p>
<p> Reset your Network settings </p>
<p> Once you’ve tweaked your router, let’s reset network settings on the phone. That should fix common connection bugs and let you start from the scratch. Have in mind that you’ll need to reestablish the settings again. </p>
<p> Choose Network Settings Reset. </p>
<p> Tap RESET SETTINGS. </p>
<p> Turn off Power-saving mode </p>
<p> Thanks to one of our readers, we obtained another workaround that just may be the one that resolves the problem. He resolved the problem by disabling the Power-saving mode, that somehow interferes with the Instagram videos playback. So, navigate to Power settings, disable Power-saving mode and your problem should be sorted out. </p>
<p> Thanks a lot to Matt that suggested this solution. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. In case you have any additional problems with Instagram, please be free to tell us in the comments, or reach us out on Twitter. We’ll do our best to help you resolve them. </p>

<p> The latest update is not always the solution. I’ve had an issue with the videos on my S8 for a few weeks and tried all of these and none of them worked. The only thing that worked was to delete the app and install an older version and it worked perfectly so it seems to be an issue with the app. Possibly a bug </p>

<p> Huawei Honor 8 most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei has gained a lot of popularity lately with both Mate (flagship) and Honor (mid-range) series. Honor 8 is the latest addition to the list of mid-budget devices produced by the Chinese company. Upon presentation for the US and EU market, the phone received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, even though Honor 8 offers good performance for an affordable price, there are some common issues worth mentioning. Users reported various problems with both hardware and software. It seems that the producer addressed some of the problems, but there is a large number of those that they need to resolve. Today we listed for you the known issues and possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Video crash while playing </p>
<p> As some of the users stated, the Honor 8 have a lot of issues with the video playback or streaming. It seems that the video crashes and, on some occasion, a restart is the only solution to get things work again. According to them, the crash occurs in online or offline videos, regardless. On the other hand, the fundament of the problem is YouTube. </p>
<p> We have noticed that the problem is widespread and the main culprit is integration with third-party apps. For the standard videos, first and foremost is to check the format. Honor 8 supports these video formats: </p>
<p> WMV </p>
<p> RM </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the online streaming videos are the ones with issues, make sure that you reinstall the given app or try an alternative. It seems that the Honor 8 have a certain level off incompatibility with some of them. Additionally, if the problem is persistent, you should contact customers support and ask for a replace. </p>
<p> Video recording stutter in third-party apps </p>
<p> While this is not as crushing (no pun intended) as the previous issue, it can be as annoying. Namely, many users reported lag and stutter while recording videos on Snapchat or Instagram story. This often leads to unsynchronized audio and video. </p>
<p> This seems to be related to awkward camera overheating. You should check the top of your phone for temperature changes. If the phone’s temperature is normal, try restarting your phone and clearing the app cache and data. Moreover, you can check your battery temperature by typing this code in your dialer *#*#2846579#*#*. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the phone is overheated (and that seems to happen often with some users), you’ll have to let it cool down. The camera behavior is not a strong feature of this model since the following default software is underwhelming. We’ll have to wait and see are there any fixes prepared in the next update build. </p>
<p> 3G works instead LTE, WiFI won’t connect </p>
<p> Connectivity is a common issue with the Honor 8. A large number of users reported problems related both to Wi-Fi and data networks. The phone won’t connect to a known network for ages or it chooses 3G instead of much faster LTE. </p>
<p> You can try following workarounds for data network issue: </p>
<p> Switch Network type: Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings: Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and reestablish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> The Huawei confirmed that they are aware of the Wi-Fi issue. We can hope that they’ll fix it with the next patch. </p>
<p> Echo while calling </p>
<p> Some users reported a problem with in-call speaker and mic malfunction. According to them, they hear the echo while speaking on the phone. The issue is more present when the loudspeaker is ON. </p>
<p> This is a common issue with many Android-powered phones. Most of the time it is related to pre-installed Google app called TalkBack. Our advice is to turn it off. </p>
<p> No battery percentage was shown </p>
<p> Honor 8 isn’t presenting battery percentage on the home screen by default. Most of the users are accustomed to that feature and they want to enable it but don’t know how. And this is the simplest way: </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon. </p>
<p> In the upper right corner, you’ll see 3 icons. </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon that is in the middle. </p>
<p> Notifications are not displayed when screen is off </p>
<p> Some of the users were left in disbelief when their push notifications from various apps stopped. It can be a quite annoying experience that ruins all-around impression about the phone. Which is pretty great in all manners. </p>
<p> Huawei made a strange decision to improve battery life by completely disabling the notifications while the screen is off. Luckily, that can be changed in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Protected apps. </p>
<p> Add apps that you want to receive notifications from. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this article helpful. Additionally, we are sure that the phone will function much better once it gets updated to Nougat 7.0. The update cycle started on 10th February so be sure to check your phones. </p>

<p> Hello, Karen! Your best bet is to try and delete the email account and then establish it afterward. That should resolve this and similar problems. </p>

<p> I have a sudden issue where my audio stops at no particular interval, I thought it was related to my spotify app but have noticed now with videos and my audible app also it’s driving me insane!! </p>
<p> Hello, Hazel. Make sure to check the permissions for those individual apps. Next, you can wipe cache partition or perform a factory reset. If the problem is still there, there’s a great chance that hardware is malfunctioning. </p>

<p> Could you please tell me where exactly do i find option to downgrade resolution from 1080p to 720p? As far as i know it is possible but i can’t find it… </p>
<p> You can use battery saving option and let your device downgrade the resolution in order to preserve the battery life. 1.Go to Settings. 2.Tap Battery. 3.Enable ROG Power Saving. </p>

<p> Hi, i got Honor 8 a week ago, and it was already showing OS 7 update. i update and use the cell, but now i’m facing some issues, like call distortion, and ends during the call after hardly 1 minute, call connectivity and disconnection issue. WhatsApp notifications in spite of doing and setting all the advised settings; couldn’t get when screen is off. Sometimes it asked for dual authentication and sometime just unlock with finger print. I’m getting irritated by this, do you’ve solution for this, do let me know kindly. </p>
<p> Thanks Aleksandar, I’ve given my cell to Huawei Center they also advised to downgrade it. Thanks for your valuable assistance. </p>

<p> Phone is not reading contacts correctly after updating to nougat. Everyone reads as “unknown sender”. Same issue no matter the message app. Factory reset worked for a day, now it’s acting up again. </p>
<p> Hello, Duane! Have you tried clearing message app cache/data? Additionally, you may want to update your messaging apps. The last thing that comes to my mind is deleting and resetting Google account. Have in mind that will work only if you backed up your contacts earlier. </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> Running 11.1.2 on my iPhone 8 and my phone dies around 8%-6% every time, getting really annoying </p>
<p> my Iphone 7 plus gets extremely hot and the battery goes down like a timer from 100% to 0 and now it doesnt want to charge and stuck at low 40% 🙁 </p>

<p> I’m on an iPhone SE and iOS 11.2.2. I have the music player on my notifications that will go away temporarily if I restart my phone, but eventually comes back. I find my phone is running hotter and the battery life seems to be much shorter. I also seem to be getting all my messenger and messaging alerts twice which makes me want to throw my phone across the room </p>

<p> Since updating to 11.2.2 on my iphone 6, the voicemail playback volume is VERY low, almost inaudible. Tech support unable to fix, (several attempts, ending in need for full restore) This at least resolved the other concern with my not hearing phone calls due to low phone call volume (tho volume control was set to highest level), but it has not resolved the voicemail issue. Tech said I had to go to store where they might take the phone and send back to factory (this is my only phone–need for work, etc. so this is not an option) I can’t… Read more » </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> My Nexus 5x is also super laggy and utterly a piece of garbage after just 18 months with oreo update. My iPhone 5s bought in 2013 almost more than 5 years old with iOS 11 is working like a dream no lags no issues made my iPhone a bit better actually. Although I know nexus has only 2gb ram so it might struggle handling a much resource oriented oreo but my iPhone has even lower 1gb ram so how can Apple do a fantastic job with iPhone that Google can’t with nexus as of now. </p>

<p> The render change (OpenGL Skia) does not fix the lagging issues Im seeing with the Nexus 5x. It also resets every reboot. The phone is horribly laggy and slow even after a cache wipe even in safe mode. </p>

<p> When I go to developer options there is no OpenGL Renderer anywhere? I also tried to reboot into recovery mode, got to the part with the android guy lying down where you press volume up + power and every time it just restarts my phone. Super frustrating! Hoping someone can help? </p>

<p> Good find. You are totally right. After I set it to SKIA, I looked at Google Photos and the photos are a complete wreck. After I changed it back to Default, Google Photos worked fine again. </p>
<p> Exactly the same described on my Nexus 5X after installing Oreo. Thought this just happens to iOS users. That sucks a lot. </p>
<p> 5x sometimes get stuck in permanent bootloop after an update. Happened to me 6 months ago. I talked to google and none of the troubleshooting worked. They told me it was a known issue and sent me a new 5x even though I was out of warranty. </p>

<p> Huawei P10 Lite common issues, and how to resolve them </p>
<p> Huawei’s enormous growth is well-justified by the devices they delivered in the last few years. It’s only the question of time before they get to contest first place with Apple or Samsung. And latest flagship ”P” handsets are definitely a step forward in many regards. </p>
<p> Even though P10 Lite isn’t on the same level as P10 and P10 plus flagships, it’s an amazing mid-range handset that rewards users with a slick design, great IPS LCD screen and overall above-average performance. It comes with the latest version of Huawei Android variation, EMUI 5.1, and to date, P10 Lite received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, after some time, issues started to pile up. Don’t get us wrong, this is is the case with most other devices and the problems we enlisted below aren’t common and widespread. But, if you have any issues with your latest acquisition, make sure to check the list below and look up for a solution. </p>
<p> Battery drainage </p>
<p> Huawei is not known for fast battery drainage on previous devices, but, it seems that the latest addition to P lite series is somewhat troubled in that regard. With the 3000 mAh, P10 Lite battery doesn’t lack longevity, at least if you’re not an intensive user. Fast charging is a great improvement over P9 and will let you recharge much faster. However, it seems that the EMUI 5.1 kind of drains more battery than EMUI 5.0 and the more demanding screen is a greater consumer, too. </p>
<p> Some users reported that the battery life is underwhelming, so we prepared some tips for you to improve it. If you’re unsure what to do, the steps below should be informative. </p>
<p> Disable power-consuming background apps. You can do that within the Phone Manager > Lock Screen Cleanup. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location Mode, and choose Device only if you’re not in need of GPS’s high accuracy at the moment. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location > 3-dot Menu > Scan settings, and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, respectively. </p>
<p> Reset phone in Safe mode and look for changes. If the battery life is much longer, that would imply that some 3rd-party app is hogging on your battery. Most of the time, the problem is resolved by uninstalling lately installed apps. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Disable Auto brightness and set a preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Slow speed and lag </p>
<p> In the hardware department, P10 Lite is probably one of the best-buy models in the mid-range category. It’s fast and reliable as they come. However, the occasional issues with performance aren’t unusual. Some of them reported freezes after unlocking while others have had experienced performance drops while running some demanding games. </p>
<p> Even the manufacturer said that the eMMC memory instead of faster UFS. That’s just like that. Another thing that might affect performance drops is related to overheating which we will address below. </p>
<p> If you’ve experienced something similar, there are some things you can do to resolve the issue. </p>
<p> Restart your device. If it won’t react to standard Power Off procedure, you can force shut down by holding the Power button long enough. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. Follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Let the phone cool down for a while. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> SIM card issues </p>
<p> Just as the previous iterations in P Lite series, P10 Lite supports either dual-SIM or SIM + SD card variation. Now, it’s not exactly hard to set up preferred cards in the compartment, but there are some things to know. Firstly, only the primary SIM card supports 3G and above technologies. Second is exclusively bound to 2G. So, if you’ve experienced connection losses or a network coverage error, make sure to check which card you use. </p>
<p> In addition, you should double check is everything set as intended before the suspicion of hardware malfunction arises. In addition, you can restart your device and look for changes. After that, you shouldn’t have any problems with the SIM card. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issue </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues were not uncommon for Huawei handsets before, and they are still present for some users of P10 Lite. Some of them reported connectivity issues while trying to pair their phone with the car media board or a wireless headset. For some, the connection is unstable and crashing frequently, while others weren’t able to connect in the first place. Firstly, you must make sure that the P10 Lite is the culprit for the failed pairing. Check connection with multiple devices to make sure that the phone is the problem. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, follow the instructions below to resolve the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Make sure that the Airplane mode is disabled. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Clear pairing and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Try disabling Wi-Fi and Mobile Data while using Bluetooth. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, you should contact your vendor or responsible carrier since the problem is certainly hardware-related. </p>
<p> Fingerprint scanner issues </p>
<p> The fingerprint scanner is more than a useful feature on flagship devices. But, lately, even the mid-range devices are packing reader with a variety of nifty uses. And Huawei is one of the first large manufacturers that started implementing fingerprint reader on the majority of its devices. The scanner on Huawei P10 Lite is just as fast and well-placed like on P9. But, there’s still a problem or two regarding its occasional erratic behavior. </p>
<p> There are some workarounds you can apply before concurring that the hardware is the problem. </p>
<p> Clean your fingerprint scanner. Use a wet cloth to clean the fingerprint scanner of dirt. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable fingerprint gestures. Open Settings > Fingerprint ID, and disable all gestures except the standard unlock feature. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> In the end, if the problem is persistent, contact your vendor or carrier and report the problem. </p>
<p> Volume issues </p>
<p> Certain users reported issues with the sound volume of certain apps notifications and many other aspects, with the exclusion of ringer sound that works as intended. Namely, some of them reported too loud or quiet notifications and other multimedia features. And even though they tried to regulate or even mute the sound, it still remained the same. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to wait for the future update which should resolve the sound bug. Meanwhile, you can use the ”Do not disturb” mode to disable certain sounds. In addition, try some of these workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Boot in safe mode. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC with HiSuite. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> Overheating issues </p>
<p> Another problem that emerged with the introduction of massive hardware improvements is the overheating. And most of the modern smartphones will eventually get hot, but some of them are more prone to it than others. Huawei P10 Lite, for example, is prone to overheating. Especially in the upper back part. Don’t get us wrong, this occurrence requires certain circumstances, like intensive gaming or exposure to the sun for an extended period, or use during charging. </p>
<p> Because of that, make sure to keep your phone far from the heat sources and leave it be while fast charging. In addition, don’t use alternative, commercial chargers instead of the one OEM provided you with. </p>
<p> Moreover, if the device overheating occurs during the idle state or standard use, make sure to take it for repair or ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Besides the Bluetooth issue, there are additional problems that are also related to connectivity. Namely, some users reported poor Wi-Fi signal or constant disconnection while using P10 Lite. In addition, others are experiencing poor connection while using Mobile data. There are so many factors for this occurrence, and many of those are not exclusively phone-related. </p>
<p> We enlisted some of the probable solutions for the problem and you can find them just below. </p>
<p> Mobile Data troubleshooting: </p>
<p> Switch Network type. Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. Go to Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Forget network and re-establish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz. It lacks range, but it’s a more stable option. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition within Recovery settings. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> After that, your connectivity issues should be long gone. In contrary, if those steps failed to resolve the issue at hand, make sure to report the problem to service or to manufacturer support itself. </p>
<p> That should be it. If you have any additional problems or alternative solutions for the ones presented, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Has anyone had an issue with the charging port not accepting the charger cable easily? My P10 Lite is a great phone every other respect but at less than a year old I would expect the charging port to have a bit more durability. I may have to use a rubber band to hold the cable in place if it gets any worse. Any suggestions? </p>
<p> My Huawei mate 10 lite puts callers on hold part way through my conversation. How can I stop this? </p>

<p> A number of issues I had with P10 Lite, which included the phone not going idle when not used and short battery life, disappeared after I installed Kapersky Battery Life, an App that prolongs battery life by disabling Apps which run in the background. It is the best thing I ever made in a long time. The nagging thing now is the phone goes iddle in 15 sec if I take a pause. </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> I have the iPhone 8 and after the update when using the keyboard in messages IT is changed to IT as IT did just now. Tried changing IT in the keyboard settings but did not work. </p>

<p> I’m using a 5s. Loading iOS 11 was a huge mistake. Since loading it and it’s interations have caused battery charging and draining problems. The phone runs slower on some apps including opening email and notes. </p>
<p> Once my charging issues are corrected I will no longer jump onto iOS updates. </p>

<p> The 11.1.2 has rendered my wifi inoperable. I cannot access Bluetooth either. My iPhone 7 Plus keeps trying to activate Bluetooth but never completes turning it on. I have lost wifi connection and the virtual switch is locked; it doesn’t slide to “on” position. Apple techs have told me to erase all data and restart fresh as if it’s a new phone without using iCloud backups. I’ve done 3 times exactly as I was told but still have the same problems in addition to having lost all my data. Furthermore, this 11.1.2 version has remained in my phone system –… Read more » </p>

<p> Huawei Honor 8 most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei has gained a lot of popularity lately with both Mate (flagship) and Honor (mid-range) series. Honor 8 is the latest addition to the list of mid-budget devices produced by the Chinese company. Upon presentation for the US and EU market, the phone received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, even though Honor 8 offers good performance for an affordable price, there are some common issues worth mentioning. Users reported various problems with both hardware and software. It seems that the producer addressed some of the problems, but there is a large number of those that they need to resolve. Today we listed for you the known issues and possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Video crash while playing </p>
<p> As some of the users stated, the Honor 8 have a lot of issues with the video playback or streaming. It seems that the video crashes and, on some occasion, a restart is the only solution to get things work again. According to them, the crash occurs in online or offline videos, regardless. On the other hand, the fundament of the problem is YouTube. </p>
<p> We have noticed that the problem is widespread and the main culprit is integration with third-party apps. For the standard videos, first and foremost is to check the format. Honor 8 supports these video formats: </p>
<p> WMV </p>
<p> RM </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the online streaming videos are the ones with issues, make sure that you reinstall the given app or try an alternative. It seems that the Honor 8 have a certain level off incompatibility with some of them. Additionally, if the problem is persistent, you should contact customers support and ask for a replace. </p>
<p> Video recording stutter in third-party apps </p>
<p> While this is not as crushing (no pun intended) as the previous issue, it can be as annoying. Namely, many users reported lag and stutter while recording videos on Snapchat or Instagram story. This often leads to unsynchronized audio and video. </p>
<p> This seems to be related to awkward camera overheating. You should check the top of your phone for temperature changes. If the phone’s temperature is normal, try restarting your phone and clearing the app cache and data. Moreover, you can check your battery temperature by typing this code in your dialer *#*#2846579#*#*. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the phone is overheated (and that seems to happen often with some users), you’ll have to let it cool down. The camera behavior is not a strong feature of this model since the following default software is underwhelming. We’ll have to wait and see are there any fixes prepared in the next update build. </p>
<p> 3G works instead LTE, WiFI won’t connect </p>
<p> Connectivity is a common issue with the Honor 8. A large number of users reported problems related both to Wi-Fi and data networks. The phone won’t connect to a known network for ages or it chooses 3G instead of much faster LTE. </p>
<p> You can try following workarounds for data network issue: </p>
<p> Switch Network type: Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings: Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and reestablish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> The Huawei confirmed that they are aware of the Wi-Fi issue. We can hope that they’ll fix it with the next patch. </p>
<p> Echo while calling </p>
<p> Some users reported a problem with in-call speaker and mic malfunction. According to them, they hear the echo while speaking on the phone. The issue is more present when the loudspeaker is ON. </p>
<p> This is a common issue with many Android-powered phones. Most of the time it is related to pre-installed Google app called TalkBack. Our advice is to turn it off. </p>
<p> No battery percentage was shown </p>
<p> Honor 8 isn’t presenting battery percentage on the home screen by default. Most of the users are accustomed to that feature and they want to enable it but don’t know how. And this is the simplest way: </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon. </p>
<p> In the upper right corner, you’ll see 3 icons. </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon that is in the middle. </p>
<p> Notifications are not displayed when screen is off </p>
<p> Some of the users were left in disbelief when their push notifications from various apps stopped. It can be a quite annoying experience that ruins all-around impression about the phone. Which is pretty great in all manners. </p>
<p> Huawei made a strange decision to improve battery life by completely disabling the notifications while the screen is off. Luckily, that can be changed in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Protected apps. </p>
<p> Add apps that you want to receive notifications from. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this article helpful. Additionally, we are sure that the phone will function much better once it gets updated to Nougat 7.0. The update cycle started on 10th February so be sure to check your phones. </p>

<p> I have Honor 8 Lite, and it doesnot save new contacts. I can see the name when i press edit, but names do not save. I saw that someone on. this forum had the same problem, and was advice to follow the procedure below, which i have tried but still doesnt work for me. I dont know why Huawei makes it sooooo complicated: “Try navigating to Contacts > 3-dot More menu > Display preferences > Tap All Contacts.” (It doesnt work for me. Please help </p>
<p> Do not key in the name of the contact person at name prefix. Key in at the first name will solve your problem </p>

<p> My phone turn off especially on the night its frustrating especially when i am using my phone as a alarm clock. </p>
<p> Hello, Peter! It’s most likely that your phone have hardware issues. Sudden shutdowns are a certain indicator that something is wrong with the battery or other components. </p>

<p> Hello, I spent countless hours with Honor 8 Customer Support. They are no help at all. I can not set original mail app. At the end of process I am getting message: “could not establish connection to the server due to untrusted or invalid certificate”. When I work with other mail apps I can utilize only these which are not using any credentials and are unsafe. Anyone can help, please? </p>

<p> When I try to delete my emails from the recycle folder in my hot mail account they just reappear. Any ideas how I can delete them? </p>
<p> Have you tried to delete the account and re-establish it again? That’s a common bug. </p>

<p> I cannot get my music working on Huawei Honor 8 Google play music works ok. Also can I set a song a on google play music as Ringtone? </p>
<p> I don’t think you can. Only the track from your storage can be set as a ringtone. </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> You should also clear your device cache, that seemed to speed up my nexus quite a bit. Apps like snapchat became unusable after the oreo update, but I cleared the cache and changed the OpenGL to skia and it seems to have improved performance but it hasnt made it as good as it is on iOS for example – Snapchat doesn’t really like android users. Apps which overlay items such as facebook messenger seem to lag the phone out most of the time and especially when playing music on spotify – hope there is an update from google soon to… Read more » </p>
<p> Edit – Battery life is awful since the update, wasn’t great before but now with heavy use I get roughly 45 minutes of screen on time… </p>

<p> Same here. Sorting the opengl did not fix. Opening app like “contacts” can take 15 seconds and more. Switching between apps takes 5 to 20 seconds some time. Apps loading really slow i can see how they load element by element some times. </p>

<p> All apps are slow, keypad takes longer time. Camera takes longer to process HDR mode. </p>
<p> The same thing with my 5X. For example launcher is laggy even after reset. And there is a battery issue I think… </p>
<p> Any body figure anything out with the disappearing keyboard issue? I assume its supposed to be some kind of feature, but I’m not liking it. </p>

<p> Asus ZenFone 3 Max most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Asus makes reliable and feature-rich smartphones with various focus points. The main focus of the Max series is maximizing the battery life. The third model in the series, ZenFone 3 Max vastly (August 2016), seems to be a large advancement. The device is widely acclaimed and a viable option in the mid-range category. </p>
<p> As the case too often shows, you have more chance to win a lotto twice in a row than find a smartphone without any issues. Even though Taiwanese producer made a stable device with reliable hardware, the users reported various issues. In this article, we prepared the list of best-known issues and their possible workarounds. </p>
<p> SIM unavailable error </p>
<p> Many of you encountered the issue with the SIM card. According to user reports, after they updated the phone’s firmware, the device stopped recognizing the SIM card. That led, as you are probably aware, to a grave problem since you can’t call or receive calls in that state. </p>
<p> We advise you to try and update the firmware in order to fix this issue. Too often the update broke things while trying to address others. On the other hand, if the firmware is not the culprit, there are alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Shut down your phone, remove and reinsert your SIM card. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Roll back your firmware to a previous version. </p>
<p> We encourage you to, at the slightest sign of hardware malfunction, report the problem to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> WiFi disconnects unexpectedly </p>
<p> There are some mild issues we can overlook, and there are those that just can’t be tolerated. Wi-Fi is essential for every smartphone user and it seems that ZenFone 3 Max have its faulty traits in the matter. According to some users, the wireless connection is unstable and crashes from time to time. Allegedly, the phone disconnects without apparent reason and user are prompted with ”WiFi connection failure” message. </p>
<p> There is a list of generic workarounds but we advise you to update your firmware first. If you are not informed about the update, you can look for updates automatically. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About. </p>
<p> Choose System Update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> The past Wi-Fi issues were resolved that way. However, if the problem is not solved, you can check these workarounds: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera shutter sound won’t turn off </p>
<p> Many of us enjoy that old fashioned shutter sound implemented in digital cameras. On the other hand, many of us didn’t. It’s the personal preference. However, it seems that the ZenFone 3 Max have some kind of bug that prevents you from turning the shutter sound off. </p>
<p> We roamed in search for the solution and find these possible workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Reset camera settings. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from 3rd party apps that use a camera (Snapchat, Instagram, Skype). </p>
<p> Try starting in the Safe Mode to see is the problem still there. In order to do so, press Power Key and tap and hold Power Off on-screen power option for a few seconds. You should see pop up message “Do you want to reboot your phone in safe mode?”. Confirm selection and try out the camera while in the safe mode. </p>
<p> Restore phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> ”Battery usage is not available” error </p>
<p> It seems that battery issues are relentless even on the devices that focus on battery as the main trait. A lot of users reported a usual error on Android devices. Namely, they are unable to check battery consumption since all of the battery data is unavailable. Even though it seems like an ordinary bug, this issue demands a lot of time and patience in order to be resolved. Namely, you’ll have to recalibrate your battery. That way the system software will reestablish the data monitoring and your statistics will be available. You can do that by following instructions bellow. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> This way you should recalibrate your battery and fix this issue. However, have in mind that this is a lengthy workaround. Additionally, you shouldn’t repeat it too often since it can affect the battery performance and reduce its longevity. </p>
<p> No ringtone, alarm or notifications sound </p>
<p> Other users reported various issues related to system sounds, with both media and notifications. According to those users, all of the sounds, including the alarm are silent. You can manipulate device sounds via multimedia center or with built-in Audio Wizard. </p>
<p> All information provided lead us to a conclusion that this is either a bug or a hardware malfunction. If you recently installed the firmware update, that is the probable reason for this issue. On the other hand, we found Audio Wizard problematic from time to time. So, try these steps and hope for the best: </p>
<p> Install the latest firmware available. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Try out restarting your phone in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Go to Audio Wizard and choose Smart mode instead of Outdoor. </p>
<p> Restore to factory setting. </p>
<p> But, if the sound of silence is the only thing you here afterward, address the issue to your phone vendor. </p>
<p> Mobile Data connection problem </p>
<p> It seems that dual-SIM support is often a drawback rather than an advantage. Namely, the ZenFone 3 Max users reported Mobile Data connectivity issues while switching between the SIM cards. It is there so it should work seamlessly. Well, not really. </p>
<p> We have a troubleshoot for this issue but your best bet is to focus on one card all the time until the issue is resolved with upcoming update releases. These are the workarounds you should try out: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Remove and insert back both SIM cards. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Mobile network and set preferred mobile data (LTE or 4G) </p>
<p> Restore the Network settings. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory setting. </p>
<p> The phone won’t update firmware </p>
<p> As you already saw, the majority of the problems come with the firmware. On some occasions, updates that fix one issue create few others. That practice is proven way to get you furious and ecstatic at the same time. In Asus defense, they at least listen to most of the consumer’s feedback while giving the impression that they at least remotely care. </p>
<p> So, if you are experiencing some of these issues and all workarounds failed miserably, the firmware update is the only solution. Or the downgrade. </p>
<p> We hope you found our list useful. If you have additional issues or suggestions for other workarounds, please tell us in the comments. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> How to fix the most common camera problems on iOS 14 </p>
<p> Apple’s done an amazing job with the iPhone cameras. And we’re not even talking about the sheer image or video quality, that one’s in its own league. We’re talking about the usability, stability, and consistency of the iPhone’s camera software that works in perfect harmony with hardware. </p>
<p> Issues seldom happen with the iPhone’s camera app. When they do, though, it’s generally at the worst time possible. The last thing you want is to miss catching that precious memory because your iPhone’s camera doesn’t work. So, if you’ve come across such an issue lately, you’ll want to act quickly and get the camera back in order as soon as possible. </p>
<p> That’s why we’ll try to address some of the most common issues with the iPhone camera app in this article. Hopefully, you’ll either get that camera fixed or at least get a better idea of what’s going on. So, keep reading. </p>
<p> iPhone camera problems (black screen, front camera not working, and more) </p>
<p> “iPhone camera not working” is a broad keyword. You might encounter the black screen in the camera app, the app might crash or take blurry images. Or maybe you have problems with the front camera. There’s no way for me to know the exact camera issue that’s bugging you. </p>
<p> But bear in mind we’re on iOS. That means our troubleshooting options are limited to what Apple actually allows us to do. But put in another perspective, that also means most of the fixes you’re actually allowed to do will probably help with multiple problems. That’s why I’ve compiled a small list of general workarounds that you can try no matter the issue you’ve got. </p>
<p> I know most of these are as generic as they get, but as I said, your hands are more or less tied. On the positive end, despite being generic, the workarounds might potentially work, which is most important in the end. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Re-open the camera app </p>
<p> Before doing anything more drastic, simply try re-opening the camera app to see if the problem is just a momentary glitch. Just swipe up from the bottom of the screen, close the camera app, and open it again. If the problem is gone, that’s it, you’re done. </p>
<p> But if the camera app still doesn’t work properly, you’ll have to put in some more work and try another workaround. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Restart your iPhone </p>
<p> The logic here is the same as above. But we’re going to do it system-wide. Although iOS is the most consistent OS on the market, it could face a glitch or two, just because it keeps so many apps and processes running in the background. So, a fresh start might actually help. </p>
<p> Press and hold both the Side button and the Volume Up button at the same time until the power off slider appears. Just drag the slider, and wait for a couple of seconds for your iPhone to power off. Now, turn your iPhone back on and try the camera app. If the issue persists, we’re back at the drawing board. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Check for updates </p>
<p> At the time of writing this article, iOS 14 is still in its early public stages. And early iOS versions can get messy sometimes. That’s when users encounter the majority of problems and your camera might not be an exception. There may be a faulty inside iOS 14’s code that renders the camera app unusable. </p>
<p> If the camera problem was indeed caused by an update, there’s probably nothing you can do. Except waiting for another update. But don’t worry, if the issue is widespread Apple will be quick to tackle it, because it surely doesn’t want to keep users isolated from such an integral feature. </p>
<p> I know it’s incredibly irritating to be unable to basically do anything. But you’ll have to go through it. In the meantime, you can use a third-party camera app to give your phone at least some snapping capabilities. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Turn off the VoiceOver feature </p>
<p> For some reason, the VoiceOver feature tends to interfere with the camera app, causing it to stop working. Now, I couldn’t find the exact reason anywhere, but apparently, it’s a thing. So, if you have this feature enabled, disabling it may resolve the camera problem. It won’t hurt to try, anyway. </p>
<p> Here’s how to disable the VoiceOver feature on iOS 14: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Accessibility > VoiceOver. </p>
<p> Toggle VoiceOver off. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reset the settings </p>
<p> If you can’t identify the exact cause of the camera problem, you can try resetting the settings altogether. If there’s something that causes interference with the camera app in your iPhone’s settings, loading defaults will definitely take care of it. </p>
<p> Now, you’ll want to think twice before resetting all your settings, because getting everything in order again can be both time-consuming and annoying. So, proceed to reset the settings only if you’ve already tried everything else. It’s also a good idea to make a backup of your settings and data to iCloud, so you can reset it later without much hassle. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset your iPhone settings: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to General > Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset All Settings, enter your passcode, and confirm. </p>
<p> Your iPhone will reboot and all the settings will be restored to defaults. </p>
<p> How to fix blurry photos </p>
<p> One of the most common issues with the iPhone camera, and also a problem that can have more solutions than the ones mentioned above, are blurry photos. Naturally, you expect the best image quality from your iPhone’s camera. Unfortunately, that’s not the case for some users, as people have been reporting the problem with blurry images for years. An issue that persists in iOS 14. </p>
<p> It’s important to point out that the blurry photos problem doesn’t necessarily have to do anything with software. Most of the time, there’s something on the outside that disrupts the sharpness of your photos, like a case or dirty lenses. So, don’t look at this problem as an “iOS 14 issue”, as it probably has nothing to do with the system version. Of course, if none of the following workarounds help, you can always try the above-mentioned solutions and see what happens. </p>
<p> With that out of the way, let’s do the work. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clean the lenses </p>
<p> The first thing you should do is simply cleaning the camera module on your iPhone. There’s a good chance the lenses got dirty from everyday usage, which prevents the camera from focusing properly. A simple wipe with a microfiber cloth should resolve the problem. </p>
<p> Just remember not to clean the lenses with your fingers, as you may make things even worse. That’s why a microfiber cloth is the best tool for the job. If you don’t have it, you can buy one at the nearest supermarket for literal pennies. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Remove the case </p>
<p> Although it shouldn’t be the case, some iPhone coverings tend to obstruct the camera lenses, leading to, well, disrupted photos. The photos may appear darker, distorted, or in this case, blurry. </p>
<p> So, just remove the case, snap a few photos, and see if there’s any difference. If there is, and your photos don’t appear blurry when you take them with your phone out of the case, it’s time for a change. Just buy a new case or a skin that won’t actually downgrade your phone. And that’s it, the case is rested. </p>
<p> Bonus: Use a third-party app </p>
<p> After all this troubleshooting, I still can’t say I’m overly optimistic I managed to solve your problems. As I said, it’s probably a faulty update, in which case, there isn’t too much we can do. However, there’s still something you can do to help yourself go through this hard period. </p>
<p> I’m, of course, talking about a third-party camera app. Sure, you’ll be giving up the recognizable stock camera experience for some time, and setting up and using a third-party camera app requires more work, and probably money (most good camera apps aren’t free), but there’s still an upside. </p>
<p> So, who knows, maybe this awkward camera situation turns out to be a blessing in disguise, and you discover your new camera app that will actually allow you to take even better photos with your iPhone. </p>

<p> How to find out which app hoggs CPU on your Android </p>
<p> Most of the apps you’ve ever seen and decided to install on your Android device is there for a reason. Some of them are useful tools or vivid games, others are Flappy Bird. And most of them have at least one problem. Now, most of the bugs or malfunctions are easy to locate. But, when it comes to resource-hogging of a bad optimized app, you’ll need to do some extra work. </p>
<p> You can easily locate RAM, storage or battery vampires, but it’s a bit harder when it comes to CPU. And the impact certain apps has on your handset’s CPU is too often disregarded as not essential due to the way the Android functions. The system indeed controls the CPU usage and kills some background processes to enables the others that are currently active to take more resources. But, that’s too often not enough for your device to work as fast as intended. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we prepared an informative article that should show you how to locate and terminate CPU-hogging apps in just a few steps. If you’re suspicious and want a complete control of your device, make sure to check the explanation below. </p>
<p> UPDATE: Google doesn’t allow third-party apps to access the hardware status anymore, due to security reasons. So, there’s no way of checking the CPU usage without rooting your phone. </p>
<p> Use built-in resources </p>
<p> They are limited but should provide you with basic insight into the background doings of certain apps. The readings are mostly oriented toward the battery usage, but you can enable the CPU activity and act accordingly. But, firstly, let’s make a distinction. For example, if you play demanding, graphically intensive game and your last registered CPU activity is high, that’s OK. However, if some app that works in the background causes CPU spikes, that’s not what you want, we assure you. </p>
<p> If you’re not sure how to enable CPU on your Android device, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings. </p>
<p> Open About and navigate to Build number. </p>
<p> Click 7 times on the number to enable Developer options in Settings. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings and open newly unlocked Developer options. </p>
<p> Locate the Monitoring pane below and enable Show CPU usage. </p>
<p> Now, you’ll be informed of the CPU activity in the real time. With that, you should be able to locate and disable certain background apps from hogging on your CPU immensely. </p>
<p> If you’re uncertain how to forcibly disable apps, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Developer options. </p>
<p> Tap Running services or Processes. </p>
<p> Stop suspicious apps. </p>
<p> Have in mind that this is effective only before the restart. With the new restart, there’s a chance that the app process you terminated will emerge again like the phoenix from ashes. Because of that, you should take into the consideration uninstalling of the troubling app. In addition, if you’re sure that the CPU usage is stable, you can easily disable the on-screen CPU monitoring and continue using your device just like before. </p>
<p> Use 3rd-party apps </p>
<p> Now, let’s move to a real deal. Most of the modern smartphones come with the built-in maintenance tools. However, most of the time, they’re not properly suited for advanced readings, but rather for the cache cleanup. For those, you’ll need a third-party tool.Well, there you can get a bit dazzled and confused with the variety of available tools. Luckily, we prepared a list of best-suited free tools for the job, including their main traits. </p>
<p> System Monitor Lite </p>
<p> Pros: </p>
<p> Great and simple but nonetheless colorful user interface. </p>
<p> Covers all the main readings you need, 6 of them, to be exact. Including the CPU activity, of course. </p>
<p> Small in size but quite powerful tool. </p>
<p> Supports most of the devices available in the market. </p>
<p> Individual core monitoring. </p>
<p> Cons: </p>
<p> Paid option is much better in many regards, especially for advanced users. </p>
<p> You can download System Monitor Lite on this link. </p>
<p> UPDATE: System Monitor Lite has been removed from the Play Store. </p>
<p> TinyCore </p>
<p> Pros: </p>
<p> Well-designed and small in size as you would expect. </p>
<p> It more looks like a built-in tool since it integrates into the system and provides you with readings in real time. </p>
<p> Stats-bar is well placed and informative. </p>
<p> Low system footprint. </p>
<p> Cons: </p>
<p> As same as System Monitor Lite, TinyCore is somehow underwhelming when compared with the premium version, especially when it comes to customization. </p>
<p> Probably the best CPU monitoring app you can obtain for free. </p>
<p> Mirrors most of the features available on the PC version of the app. </p>
<p> Supports most of the available handsets. </p>
<p> Cons: </p>
<p> It’s not as attractive visually as some other apps. </p>
<p> Too many ads. Including video ads with pop-ups and all that jazz that can drive you mad and diminish the overall experience. </p>
<p> Have in mind that these tools are there just for monitoring. They are just a first step. Once you’ve learned the cause of the CPU spikes, you must manually navigate and terminate the CPU-hogging apps. </p>
<p> That should conclude our list and instructions. We certainly hope that you’ll find those helpful. In addition, don’t forget to offer your opinions, questions or suggestions in the comments section below. </p>

<p> “Locate the Monitoring pane below and enable Show CPU usage.” </p>
<p> All I have in dev options/monitoring is a toggle for “strict mode enabled” and “profile GPU rendering” – no option there to “show CPU usage”. I’m on Pixel 2, stock ROM, 8.1.0, build OPM2.171026.006.G1. </p>
<p> It seems this option has been removed, which means third-party apps are your only option now. </p>
<p> It gets even worse. After a bit more digging, it looks like they removed CPU profiling by app *completely* from Oreo now. I think only way you can get it working is if you are rooted, which I’m not. 🙁 Bummer. I was really hoping to figure out the app responsible for overloading my Pixel 2 to the point that it’s barely responsive and practically unusable for anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute or more. Although, this does usually seem to happen after opening Facebook Messenger’s “Chat Heads” UI to reply to a message, so I’m suspecting that it’s… Read more » </p>
<p> Yeah, It seems third-party apps are not allowed to access the hardware status due to security reasons. And this probably won’t change in Android Q. So, it appears that rooting is the only way to go. The closest thing to checking resource usage by app is by going to Dev options > Running services. Maybe you’ll get an idea of what’s going on from there. However, if you suspect Messenger is the culprit, you can try the Lite version, if you’re willing to make a compromise. </p>
<p> Even if you’re rooted under Android 9 neither Tinycore nor CPU-Z shows CPU usage per app. </p>

<p> How to deactivate Facebook Messenger on Android </p>
<p> Facebook Messenger is one of the most popular instant messengers today. Partly because it’s mandatory for Facebook users who want to chat with their friends, partly because it encompasses some nice features (e.g. dark mode, chat heads, etc.). </p>
<p> However, people that decided to deactivate or even delete Facebook were bamboozled by the fact that the Messenger is still active, alive and kicking. Well, shortly, as it’s a separate service, it needs to be deactivated separately. </p>
<p> Today, we made sure to thoroughly explain how to deactivate the Messenger on Android. Also, read below to learn how to deactivate it permanently or reactivate it again. </p>
<p> How do I deactivate Facebook Messenger? </p>
<p> In order to deactivate Facebook Messenger, you’ll need to deactivate your Facebook account first. Facebook separated them for a reason, trying to make Facebook Messenger more of an instant messenger instead of just a Facebook chat option. </p>
<p> This, of course, brought a lot of confusion to users, that now have to use two apps on their Android devices in order to browse Facebook and message their friends. And, as with all unpopular changes, people eventually came to terms with the presence of two separate apps. </p>
<p> The main annoyance lies in the fact that the Messenger isn’t automatically deactivated once you deactivate or delete your Facebook account. You need to do it in the app or via the web-client. Once you deactivate it, other users won’t be able to send you messages. </p>
<p> Also, once you deactivate Messenger, you won’t be able to use it as a default SMS app. Regardless if you have your number assigned to your account. So keep that in mind. </p>
<p> Now, let’s get to instructions on how to disable Facebook Messenger. Follow these steps to deactivate Facebook Messenger on your Android device: </p>
<p> Open the Facebook app. If you don’t use it, download it from the Play Store, here. </p>
<p> Log in with your credentials. </p>
<p> From the home page, tap the hamburger menu and select Settings & Privacy. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Account Ownership and Control. </p>
<p> Select Deactivation and Deletion. </p>
<p> Choose to “Deactivate account” and then tap Continue to Account Deactivation. </p>
<p> Follow the steps, provide feedback if that’s your cup of tea, and confirm deactivation with your Facebook password. </p>
<p> Now, open Facebook Messenger and tap on your profile picture. </p>
<p> Select Legal & Policies. </p>
<p> Choose Deactivate Messenger. </p>
<p> Enter your password and tap Deactivate. </p>
<p> How to permanently delete Facebook Messenger </p>
<p> This is as simple as one would expect. If you want your Facebook Messenger no more (probably have a good reason for that), just delete your Facebook account permanently. Once the Facebook account is out of the picture, Messenger will be deleted, too. </p>
<p> Just keep in mind that this will lead to deleting complete chat history and you won’t be able to use the app as the main SMS app. Not to mention that you won’t be able to access your Facebook account anymore. </p>
<p> If you are decisive about ditching Facebook and Messenger once and for all, here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open the Facebook app. If you don’t use it, download it from the Play Store, here. </p>
<p> Log in with your credentials. </p>
<p> From the home page, tap the hamburger menu and select Settings & Privacy. </p>
<p> Choose Account Ownership and Control. </p>
<p> Select Deactivation and Deletion. </p>
<p> Choose Delete Account. </p>
<p> Choose whether you want to download your data and review linked apps. </p>
<p> Tap Delete Account once you are done and that should permanently relieve you of Facebook and Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reactivate Facebook Messenger on Android </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you are done with your social media detox and want to get back on the grid, reactivating Facebook Messenger is as simple as it comes. You don’t have to reactivate your Facebook account in order to get back to Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> This way, you’ll get straight into your chat history without losing anything as chats are stored on a dedicated server. </p>
<p> The reactivation is as simple as it gets. Just log in with your credentials again and you are good to go. </p>
<p> That’s it. Hopefully, this was a helpful read that showed you how to deactivate Facebook Messenger with ease. Thanks for reading and share your thoughts on the subject in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<p> How to delete Google Assistant history on Android </p>
<p> After both public backlash and legal actions, Google had to improve on the way users can control their privacy. Many options were kind of hidden and thus regular users had no idea of what’s stored or how to delete it. Now, you can quite simply delete Google Assistant history, including all voice queries you’ve made. </p>
<p> You should probably be aware by now that Google stores everything. Literally, every even remotely associated activity is stored in the cloud, including all commands you gave to your Google Assistant that are recorded. Of course, you can simply disable all activity-tracking options, including Assistant, YouTube, Web and, Apps history. </p>
<p> If you want a certain conversation or even all Google Assistant history gone, we got you covered. </p>
<p> How do I delete my Google Assistant history? </p>
<p> Google Assistant will, by default, keep all your voice commands and conversations you had with it. On all your devices assigned to a particular Google Account. </p>
<p> Google uses Web Activity along with your voice (or text) inputs to improve on the user experience, provide you with on-point personalized results for your queries and more. </p>
<p> All that is fine and dandy until you want to delete a specific activity or activity for certain time periods. With that said, read below and learn how to delete your Google Assistant history with ease. </p>
<p> Delete your Assistant activity with voice commands </p>
<p> You can delete Google Assistant activity with nothing else but your voice. This is great if you want to delete your activity for today, for a whole week or the last conversation you had with your assistant. </p>
<p> Here are the voice commands to use to delete Google Assistant activity: </p>
<p> Delete the latest command or thing the Assistant heard by saying “OK, Google, that wasn’t for you”. </p>
<p> To delete the latest conversation say “OK, Google, delete my last conversation”. </p>
<p> To delete activity for the last week, say “OK, Google, delete this week’s activity”. </p>
<p> Delete activity for today or yesterday, say “OK, Google, delete today’s/yesterday’s activity”. </p>
<p> Delete history in Google Account Activity settings </p>
<p> Alternatively, if you want to delete a particular activity or just take a look into your Activity, you can do so in My Activity menu. You can have a deep insight into everything Google Cloud services recorded, even play recordings which are, privacy-wise, quite an issue for some people. </p>
<p> Now, here’s how to access your Google Assistant activity and delete specific conversations or queries: </p>
<p> On your phone, open Google Assistant and expand it. You can do so with voice trigger ( say OK, Google or Hey, Google) or with the shortcut. </p>
<p> Tap on your Account icon in the top right corner. </p>
<p> Then, tap on the 3-dot menu and open My Activity. </p>
<p> Once there, locate the activity you want to delete, tap on the 3-dot menu and delete it. </p>
<p> If you want to delete everything, just tap on the 3-dot menu next to the Search your activity bar and select Delete activity by. Once there, tap All time and confirm when prompted. </p>
<p> How to disable Web & App activity </p>
<p> If you want to prevent Google from recording and storing your Google Assistant queries, you can do so by disabling Web & App activity. This can be done within the Activity controls menu. Do have in mind that this might affect the responsiveness and overall experience of Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to disable Web & App activity: </p>
<p> Like in the previous step, navigate to My Activity. </p>
<p> Once there, tap on the Change setting under the Web & App Activity. </p>
<p> Here, you can disable Web & App activity (Chrome, apps, and devices history). Alternatively, you can just uncheck the Include voice and audio recordings if you don’t want Google to store your voice in the cloud. </p>
<p> That should do it. Thank you for reading and we hope you are happy with the explanation. In case you have any questions or suggestions, do us a favor and share them with us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> How to disable Adaptive brightness in Android </p>
<p> Why would anyone in their right mind disable one feature which has been automatized for ages and manages brightness manually? Well, it depends on the hardware you have and the software which runs it. If the ambient light sensor works as intended, the adaptive brightness is more than a viable option. </p>
<p> Now, even though budget handsets are getting cheaper, the OEMs still make some cuts. For example, the Mi A1 is one of the best budget devices from the past year. Might be the best when it comes to bang for the buck. </p>
<p> However, that ambient light sensor certainly isn’t the selling point for the Xiaomi’s Android One handset. And that’s where we get to our point. Me personally don’t fancy the Adaptive brightness feature on Android in general. </p>
<p> It’s erratic and not as precise. However, if we add a bad light sensor, you’ll do yourself a favor by disabling it. You might dim the screen a tad too much, but the battery life will prolonge for a couple of hours. </p>
<p> Now, disabling the Adaptive brightness in Oreo or Android Pie (or any Android for that matter) is a rather simple task. But, we want to take this a step further. Firstly, Qualcomm’s CABL (Content Adaptive Backlight) is another thing you should consider disabling. And that isn’t as simple as the Adaptive Backlight. </p>
<p> It basically uses the background of an app to determine the brightness level. And, due to a disparity between the ambient light sensor and Content Adaptive Backlight, the results might come out surprisingly bad. You can disable it by following these steps: </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the home screen to open the Launcher Menu. </p>
<p> Select Widgets </p>
<p> Under Nova Launcher, select Activities and drop the widget on the home screen. </p>
<p> From the list, select Qualcomm Content Adaptive Backlight Settings. </p>
<p> Open the shortcut you just created and uncheck the “Enable Content Adaptive Backlight” box. </p>
<p> Exit and remove the shortcut. </p>
<p> In addition, if you’re not satisfied with what the built-in system Adaptive brightness management has to offer, you can use a third-party app to manage brightness instead. Now, there’s a lot of apps in this niche, but we highly suggest Lux Lite or its premium version Lux Auto Brightness. </p>
<p> They will, not only replace the built-in Adaptive brightness but take everything one step further, with the smarter sensor readings and more than a few interesting tools. With that said, we can conclude this article. Hopefully, it was a helpful read. Post your opinions in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/disable-adaptive-icons-android-oreo" parent_folder="web1" id="file17847767" filename="disable-adaptive-icons-android-oreo">
<p> Here’s why you can’t disable Adaptive Icons in Android Oreo </p>
<p> Android 8 Oreo is far from a revolutionary OS that brings your wildest fantasies about future tech to life. In fact, Google focuses on the back-end here. Most changes were made under the hood, so an average user coming from Android Nougat can barely see the difference. </p>
<p> That’s why users who care about their phones debate about some ‘less important’ features way more than they would if there were some game-changers involved. </p>
<p> A particular feature that people usually complain about is the Adaptive Icons. In fact, I’ve barely seen a positive review of this feature. This tells us one thing. Android Oreo users are divided into two groups – those who hate Adaptive Icons and those who simply don’t care enough to talk about them. </p>
<p> Since the second group probably won’t even bother to search for this article, it’s for all of you who have a feud with Adaptive Icons in Android Oreo. For all of you who are frustrated for being trapped with Adaptive Icons and don’t really get why it has to be that way. </p>
<p> We’ll discuss it all here. </p>
<p> Why are Adaptive Icons there in the first place? </p>
<p> Unlike iOS, where Apple pretty much controls the whole ecosystem, Android (being an open source OS) gives each member of its family more liberties. Individually, that’s a great thing. But it may not be beneficial for the greater good. </p>
<p> Developers have the freedom to polish every single aspect of their apps to smallest details. Both in terms of aesthetics and functionality. But we’ll focus on the aesthetics here. Subjectively looking, even though a single app’s icon looks great, it may not fit in with the rest of the icons, giving your home screen an awkward uniquely biased look. </p>
<p> These inconsistencies usually irritate people. In fact, people have been complaining about this since the earliest days of Android. And the fact that different phones all have their own custom ROM brings even more inequality. </p>
<p> So, Google decided to normalize things by trying to satisfy everyone’s taste. That’s how the idea of the Adaptive Icons was born. In theory, the whole plan looks legit and doable. But the result we got with Android Oreo speaks differently. </p>
<p> What are Adaptive Icons </p>
<p> The biggest misconception people have about Adaptive Icons is that it’s a launcher or appearance customization feature. That’s not true. Adaptive Icons is a system feature that should make third-party apps’ icons in-line with default icons provided by OEM. </p>
<p> I won’t dig into technical details too much here, so here’s how Google explainsAdaptive Icons: </p>
<p> “Android 8.0 (API level 26) introduces adaptive launcher icons, which can display a variety of shapes across different device models. For example, an adaptive launcher icon can display a circular shape on one OEM device, and display a squircle on another device. Each device OEM provides a mask, which the system then uses to render all adaptive icons with the same shape. Adaptive launcher icons are also used in shortcuts, the Settings app, sharing dialogs, and the overview screen.” </p>
<p> In order to follow Google’s rules of Adaptive Icons developers have to submit their icons in two layers, a transparent foreground layer and a solid background layer. As explained above, the launcher then cuts the layers into a shape specified by OEM. </p>
<p> As the OS uses an already provided mask to shape the icons automatically, there’s nothing you can do about it. Even though you’re not satisfied with the outcome. It’s just how the system works. </p>
<p> Now you know that as long as you’re using Android Oreo, Adaptive Icons will be there. You can’t simply erase them from your phone in any way. But, there’s a way to at least change the appearance of Adaptive Icons on your phone. </p>
<p> Obviously, this can’t be done using your stock launcher, but if you really can’t stand the current look of Adaptive Icons on your phone, there’s a third-party solution. </p>
<p> Use Nova Launcher </p>
<p> Nova Launcher is arguably the most popular third-party launcher for Android. Mostly because of its wealth of customization features. This includes the ability to change the shape of Adaptive Icons, which was introduced last year. </p>
<p> So, if you want to at least do something about your ugly adaptive icons, you can change their shape. I know it’s not what you’re looking for, but it gives you some customization freedom. Here’s how to change Adaptive Icons in Nova Launcher: </p>
<p> Open Nova Launcher Settings. </p>
<p> Go to Look & Feel > Adaptive Icons. </p>
<p> Choose the preffered shape of Adaptive Icons. </p>
<p> That’s about it. It is a bare minimum, but at least you’re able to adjust the icons to a more likable shape. That’s better than not being able to do anything about Adaptive Icons at all. </p>
<p> As it appears, Google still hasn’t solved the problem with unbiased icons on various Android phones. But we have another Android version ahead of us. As we still don’t know what will the new version bring, we can only hope Google will introduce a more viable solution for icons on your Home screen. Hopefully a better one. </p>
<p> What do you think about Adaptive Icons in Android Oreo and the way they function? Let us know in the comments below. </p>
<p> 26 COMMENTS </p>
<p> I absolutely hate this feature! Thank you Google, for shoving it down or throats (i guess you did learn something from Apple) and making every Android device look like a cheap iPhone ripoff. </p>

<p> I hate adaptive icons. Here’s why: The purpose of an icon is something visual for your brain to easily identify amongst a bunch of other icons. The brain has a couple things to work with: Shape and color. Making every icon have the same outline shape essentially cuts the information available in half, making it take much more effort to find the one icon you’re looking for amongst many. It’s an increased cognitive load to have every icon have the same shape, and it goes against the very purpose of icons. </p>
<p> Exactly. But the information is cut even more! The actual icon itself is much smaller – doesn’t usually even fill the circle, so that in difficult times – outside, bright sun, forgot glasses, – it gets even more difficult to find the icon you are looking for. </p>

<p> How to disable Android Lock Screen </p>
<p> Lock Screen is the first thing you see every time you turn your screen on. It’s main purpose mainly is to keep our phones safe from accidental touches, or from someone else’s access. </p>
<p> However, there are some people who are actually annoyed by this feature. They simply want to start using their phones as soon as they tap the button, without entering complicated patterns, or passwords. So, if you’re one of them, we’ve got you covered. </p>
<p> In this article, you’ll find out how to disable the Lock Screen on your Android phone, and save a few seconds, that you would normally spend on unlocking it. </p>
<p> Remove the Lock Screen in Android </p>
<p> Disabling the Lock Screen in Android is as easy as unlocking your phone, you just need to change a few settings, and you won’t have to deal with this feature ever again. Here’s exactly what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open the Settings app on your phone (you can find it in the menu, or in the Notifications bar, but you probably already know how to access it). </p>
<p> Go to Security > Screen Lock. </p>
<p> Now, just select None </p>
<p> The phone will then ask you to enter your PIN or Password. Enter it, confirm, and the Lock Screen will be disabled. </p>
<p> There you go, after performing this action, the Lock Screen will be completely disabled on your Android device, and you’ll be able to use it when you want, immediately. </p>
<p> On the other hand, we don’t recommend disabling the Lock Screen on your phone. Why? Well, read below. </p>
<p> Why you shouldn’t disable the Lock Screen </p>
<p> Entering the password every time you want to access your phone can be annoying sometimes, but that’s not a reason good enough to convince you to completely disable the Lock Screen. If you don’t have any security method on your phone, it will be extremely vulnerable, and accessible to anyone. </p>
<p> Also, a lot of unwanted apps can be opened if you don’t have the Lock Screen turned on, depending on the screen sensitivity of your phone. You certainly don’t want to end up calling someone accidentally, or sending gibberish message to your Facebook friends. If you think unlocking your phone is time consuming, think again, because two seconds probably won’t mean anything. </p>
<p> As Android advances as the OS, the Lock Screen also becomes more and more customizable. Especially in Android Nougat, where you have a lot of amazing Lock Screen options, like the ability to set different wallpapers to your Lock Screen. </p>
<p> All in all, disabling the Lock Screen in Android is fairly easy, and it doesn’t require any big effort. However, it is recommended to keep this feature turned on. So, if you’re planning to turn off the Lock Screen, think about it once again. </p>

<p> Fix: Dropbox for Android not showing files </p>
<p> Using Dropbox is a convenient way of sharing and accessing your files across all your devices. But the sync doesn’t run smoothly all the time. In fact, it happens to a lot of people that they’re unable to access their files on certain devices. </p>
<p> That’s why we’ll explore the missing files issue in Android, and see why are your documents, pictures and videos not showing on your phone when you need them. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Update the app </p>
<p> Even though Dropbox is a developed cloud service, you still access it through a normal app. And as apps go, various bugs are possible. That’s why the first thing you should do when experiencing any issue, including the missing files problem, is to update the Dropbox app. </p>
<p> Just go to Play Store, search for Dropbox, and update the app if an update is available. </p>
<p> On the other hand, the latest update could also cause problems, due to bugs or other development errors. If you suspect that might be the case, there’s nothing you can do except waiting for a patch. But don’t worry, Dropbox employees enough developers and gathers a community large enough for any issues to be swiftly acknowledged. So, the fixing update should be on its way soon. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check the characters </p>
<p> Perhaps the most common culprit of the missing files in Dropbox is using unsupported characters. Dropbox only supports Latin characters! So, if your main language is not English, and you’re using another alphabet for naming files, like Greek or Russian Cyrillic, keep in mind that Dropbox won’t recognize them. </p>
<p> The problem arises when Dropbox servers try to follow the path of a certain file to sync it with your phone. So, if the file’s path is something like dropbox/CUT/τζατζίκι/build, the servers won’t recognize it. </p>
<p> This ‘rule’ applies to everything inside your Dropbox vault, be it files, folders, pictures, music, videos, etc. </p>
<p> To resolve the problem of unsupported characters, login to Dropbox on your PC or Mac, and search for any files which names contain characters that are not in the Latin alphabet. I know that could be a time-consuming and boring task, but there’s no other way of dealing with this problem. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear app cache and data </p>
<p> As I mentioned above, Dropbox is an app just like any other. So, the accumulated cache could cause a problem or two. To elimiate this possibility, simply go and clear the app cache. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Apps or Apps Manager (depending on your phone). If you can’t find it, simply search for installed apps in the Settings search bar. </p>
<p> Locate Dropbox in the Apps Manager. </p>
<p> Tap Dropbox and choose Clear cache. If clearing the cache doesn’t resolve the syncing problem, repeat the procedure, but this time choose Clear data. Keep in mind that you’ll lose all settings if you clear the app data. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check your internet connection </p>
<p> In case there’s something wrong with your internet connection, you won’t be able to use Dropbox. So, just make sure you’re properly connected to the internet. In case you encounter a certain problem, check this article for additional solutions. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the problem with missing files in Dropbox for Android. If you have any comments or additional questions, just write them down in the comments below. </p>

<p> How to make an emergency call from a locked iPhone </p>
<p> Chances are that, at least once in the lifetime, you’ll be in need to make a fast call and summon the emergency services. Maybe it’s the question between life and death, and the fastest possible reaction is of utmost importance. And what happens when let’s say, you can use only the phone that belongs to someone else, while the clock is ticking? Hell, in those scenarios you may as wall forget how to unlock your own phone. </p>
<p> Well, since over 90 million Americans use Apple-produced phones, someone would expect that the procedure of emergency call is a well-known routine. Sadly it’s not. Moreover, besides speedy emergency contact, some users may store Medical ID (Health app) on their phones, with a lot of valuable information regarding allergies, medication, or case record. Because of that, this is the subject that should be timely addressed and we’ll try and do so below. </p>
<p> Make an emergency call from a locked iPhone or access the Medical ID </p>
<p> Emergency call </p>
<p> In order to make an emergency call with a locked iPhone, follow the instructions: </p>
<p> Press Home button to open the passcode screen. </p>
<p> Tap Emergency at the bottom left corner. </p>
<p> Call emergency services. In most cases 911, 180, or 999. </p>
<p> Have in mind that you won’t be able to call private numbers. Once the emergency call is finished, the phone will lock itself. </p>
<p> Medical ID in Health app </p>
<p> For users with specific medical conditions, this app is a saver. You can keep track of vital data regarding your condition with numbers of emergency contacts or caregivers. And you can either make those available on the emergency screen or not. That is your choice. But, in case you encounter someone in a dire situation, it’s worth checking their phone for better insight. Of course, this may be of the essence for paramedics. </p>
<p> Press Home button to open the passcode screen. </p>
<p> Tap Emergency at the bottom left corner. </p>
<p> If available, you should see Medical ID at the bottom left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Tap to open Medical ID. </p>
<p> That should do it. Phones are an indispensable part of our lives and can prove as a lifesaver in the urgent moment. So, this is worth storing in some distinct part of your memory, until it’s summoned in the time of need. </p>
<p> If you have any questions or remarks, please share them with us in the comments section. We’ll be glad to help you. </p>

<p> How to enable Google Assistant on non-Google phones </p>
<p> After it was introduced in February 2017 for all non-Pixel Android devices, most users are still waiting for their turn to get a hold on Google Assistant. Android O is almost here and we are still waiting and waiting for Google premium features to come to non-Google phones. </p>
<p> Not if it’s up to us! There’s always a way to implement Google exclusives on any Android device, but most of the time, you’ll need to root your phone. Luckily, that’s not the case with the Google Assistant integration. Below, we prepared a thorough, step-by-step explanation on how to get Android Assistant on any Android phone or tablet. You’ll only need at least Marshmallow and a bit of patience. Everything else is our concern. </p>
<p> How to install Pixel’s exclusive Assistant on any Android device (Marshmallow 6.0 and above) </p>
<p> Google Assistant is an amazing improvement over Google Now that you’ll most certainly find satisfying. It has so many features you’ll need to get a hold on, smart AI which is above the competition with two-way conversation, and great integration in your everyday workflow. In addition, if you decide to use the voice command to summon it on all screens, you’ll be looking at an almost human-like assistant. </p>
<p> So, without a further ado, here are the complete and detailed instructions on how to enable Google Assistant on any Android that’s packing at least Marshmallow 6.0: </p>
<p> Enroll in Beta testing </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Google. </p>
<p> Tap the 3-dot menu and open Help & Feedback. </p>
<p> Tap the 3-dot menu again and choose View in Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Scroll down until you reach the ”Become a beta tester” option. </p>
<p> Tap ”I’m in” and confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Wait for some time. The beta sign-up procedure can take up 5-20 minutes of your time. </p>
<p> Once you see that you’re in, search for Google in the Play Store’s search bar. </p>
<p> Open Google app and navigate to the bottom. </p>
<p> Tap ”I’m in” and confirm the selection. </p>
<p> After some time, you should see available updates for both Google Play Services and Google. </p>
<p> Update both and restart your device. </p>
<p> Have in mind that you’ll need to wait for some time until your beta program inclusion is finished. </p>
<p> Configure language and clear data </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Language and input. </p>
<p> Change primary language to English (United States). </p>
<p> Open Apps or Application Manager. </p>
<p> Tap Google app. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> Choose Manage space. </p>
<p> Tap Clear All Data. Have in mind that this will delete all Google-related settings. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Choose Manage space. </p>
<p> Set up Google Assistant </p>
<p> Under Google Assistant, tap Settings. </p>
<p> At the bottom, you should see Google Assistant. Enable it. </p>
<p> Tap and hold the Home button to open Google Assistant setup window. </p>
<p> Choose ”Continue” and then tap on the ”Get Started” link. </p>
<p> Here you can ”teach” Assistant to recognize your voice by repeating ”Ok Google” 3 times. </p>
<p> That should do it. </p>
<p> Additional settings </p>
<p> These are some additional settings that should come in handy for initial use: </p>
<p> Hold the Home button to open Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Tap the Blue Shelf icon. </p>
<p> Open the 3-dot menu and choose Settings. </p>
<p> Here you can add things to your liking. Home and work location and nickname that Assistant will use when referring to you. Those might be helpful, but also might not. It’s your choice. </p>
<p> Explore what Google Assistant can do. </p>
<p> Hold the Home button to open Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Tap the Blue Shelf icon. </p>
<p> Under the Explore card, you can roam and find all of the options Assistant enables you to use. </p>
<p> Hold the Home button to open Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Tap the Blue Shelf icon. </p>
<p> Open the ”Your Stuff” card. </p>
<p> You can choose one of the presets or create your own shortcut. Example below. </p>
<p> An alternative if this didn’t work out for you </p>
<p> In addition, some users reported that they were unable to install the Beta versions of Google and Google Play Services in the standard manner. Fortunately, you can install those with the APK files and the instructions are shown below. </p>
<p> Extract the file with WinRar or similar tool until you have the APK file. </p>
<p> Connect the Android device to the PC via USB and transfer the APK file to internal memory. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Security, and enable Unknown sources. </p>
<p> Use a native file explorer or File Explorer to navigate to the folder where the APK file is stored. </p>
<p> Tap to install the APK’s one by one. </p>
<p> After that, continue with the steps from ”Configure language and clear data” subheading. </p>
<p> That should do it. We’re sure you’ll enjoy Google Assistant. Once it grows on you, the overall usability will be much more interesting. What do you reckon? Share your thoughts with us in the comments section below. Thank you for reading and have a nice day. </p>

<p> How to enable Lock Screen notifications on Huawei P9 </p>
<p> Huawei P9, the successor of the highly acclaimed P8, is one of the most popular flagships on the market. Even though Huawei already introduced the P10, the P9 is still a viable option for all Android enthusiasts. Great features, brilliant EMUI, and remarkable hardware make this handset the worthy acquisition. </p>
<p> Now, if you’re new to the Huawei interface, it may take some time to get used to its features. Namely, Huawei’s native Emotion User Interface differs a bit from the stock Android. But, once you’ve got into details, this is an amazing and clean UI that packs everything you’ll ever need. </p>
<p> One of the features that baffled some users are notifications on the lock screen. Today, we’ll give you a few hints how to utilize lock screen notifications in the best way. </p>
<p> Make sure you’ve enabled notifications </p>
<p> The first step you should take is to enable notifications in the settings. Due to security/privacy measures, this feature may be disabled by default. This is how to enable screen lock notifications. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Notifications & status bar. </p>
<p> Open Notifications management. </p>
<p> Enter the preferred apps and enable the ‘Display on the lock screen’ feature. </p>
<p> After that, you should be able to receive preset notifications from certain apps. Some users reported that they were unable to see notifications while the fingerprint unlock was enabled. You can disable it quite easily by following these instructions: </p>
<p> Choose Fingerprint ID. </p>
<p> Tap Fingerprint management. </p>
<p> Enter your PIN and tap Next. </p>
<p> On the other hand, this is not a norm, so your notifications may work even with the fingerprint scanner enabled. </p>
<p> Use Magazine Lock screen </p>
<p> For no apparent reason, notifications can only be showed on Magazine Lock Screen style. So, you’ll need to use it instead of other themes. Later on, you can change the wallpaper to improve the transparency of certain notifications. This is how to change Lock screen style: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Screen lock & passwords. </p>
<p> Tap Screen lock style. </p>
<p> Select Magazine unlock and apply changes. </p>
<p> That should enable your notifications. However, since the default cover is dark, you may want to change it for any other. You can change to any other wallpaper in Settings > Display > Wallpaper > Lock Screen. </p>
<p> Use the third-party app to tweak notifications </p>
<p> However, if you’re unable to tweak the Lock Screen notifications to your liking, you can as well use a third-party app. There’s a large variety of apps that let you customize Lock Screen but we tried and enjoyed NiLS Lock Screen Notifications the most. With this app, you are able to personalize almost everything related to notifications, from standard notification to lock screen widgets. The only downside is a mild increase in battery consumption. </p>
<p> You can obtain NiLS Lock Screen Notifications app for free here. </p>
<p> With that, we’ll wrap it up. We hope that these tips were useful and that they’ll let you improve your P9 accessibility and all-around experience. </p>
<p> In addition, we are open for suggestions and questions, so don’t forget to address those in the comments section below. </p>
<p> How do you make lock screen notifications expandable so you can read the entire message ? </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/enable-shutter-sound-iphone-7" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844056" filename="enable-shutter-sound-iphone-7">
<p> How to enable shutter sound on iPhone 7/7+ </p>
<p> One of the leading features of iPhones is astonishing photo quality. So, with the latest additions to the iPhone family, iPhone 7 and 7 +, the world get to know one of the best cameras ever placed on the back of the mobile phone. </p>
<p> However, even though the digitalization renewed the way we took our photos, we all enjoy some good old nostalgic features of analog cameras. One of those is shutter sound. Some users reported that shutter sound is missing after latest updates. It seems that is the case with latest two models. For that reason, we prepared some of the possible tips for enabling it. </p>
<p> 4 easy tips to enable shutter sound on your iPhone 7/ 7+ </p>
<p> Tune Up media volume </p>
<p> Previous versions of iPhones had its shutter sound tied with ringing volume. Basically, you tune up ringer volume and the shutter sound is there. However, that changed with mentioned two models. Now the media/music sound and shutter are tied. So, play some music, tune up the volume and the shutter sound should appear. </p>
<p> Disable Live Photo Mode </p>
<p> Another viable workaround is related to Live Photo mode. Namely, on some occasions, this mode and shutter sound won’t work together. Live Photo is a great and innovative feature that lets you record moments before and after you take a photo. However, the shutter is off while it is active. So, our best bet is to try and disable it. You can do that this way: </p>
<p> Enter your built-in camera app. </p>
<p> In the top, you should find sun-like, round icon. That’s Live Photo mode. </p>
<p> If it is yellow, then it is enabled. Tap on it to disable it. </p>
<p> Try out your camera now. </p>
<p> Use 3rd party camera app </p>
<p> If the native camera app isn’t up to the task, you can always use some third party solution. You may lose some of the built-in features but at least the shutter sound will work like a charm. Additionally, you can use your native camera app as a video recorder and take photos via third party alternative. </p>
<p> Reset phone settings </p>
<p> Last resort. But, keep in mind that this is advisable only to those that had a shutter sound in all photo modes. And it suddenly disappeared after an update or what not. Even though it resets your settings, all the data is safe from erasing. The only downside is that you’ll need to reestablish all tweaked settings afterward. You can reset your phone settings by following these steps: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Select Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Reset All Settings. </p>
<p> The Bottom Line </p>
<p> We hope that these few tips will help you with the shutter sound problem. If you are having any additional advice or opinion related to the subject, please share it with us in the comments. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/facebook-app-crashing-android" parent_folder="web1" id="file17842634" filename="facebook-app-crashing-android">
<p> How to solve Facebook Android app crashes </p>
<p> Issues with both the Facebook app and Messenger app aren’t a rarity on Android mobile devices. For some users, they are an everyday struggle, even though they shouldn’t be. However, let’s not cry over spilled milk, but rather try to fix the issues users encounter on a daily basis. One of those issues is app crashing. The Facebook app seems to crash unexpectedly and it’s hard to find out the exact reason. The problem especially occurs after the system update. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we enlisted solutions, in hope to help you resolve it. You can find the list below. </p>
<p> Update Facebook app </p>
<p> The first step you should take is somewhat a leap of faith. Namely, you’ll need to rely on the possible fix for the crash issue in the latest update. If it’s available, of course. Your phone may do the job for you with the automatic update, but in case you’ve disabled it, make sure to check these steps for the manual update. </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Tap Menu. </p>
<p> Search for Facebook in the Update list. </p>
<p> If the crashes are gone you’re good to go. However, if the problems are still there, let’s move to the firmware. </p>
<p> Update Android </p>
<p> On some occasions (rare occasions, to be perfectly honest), you can repair your app-related issues with the new firmware. Basically, some of the crashes appear after the major software update. So, in order to resolve any invoked issues, the developers shortly patch the issues with the small fixes. So, you should just in case, check for the available updates for your device. And this is how: </p>
<p> Enable Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Move down and tap System update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> If the update is available, tap Download & Install. </p>
<p> Make sure that your battery is at least at the 30% before updating. </p>
<p> If the Facebook app still crashes, move up to the next step on the list. </p>
<p> Clear Facebook app cache and data </p>
<p> Another thing worth checking is also one of the best-known Facebook app’s drawbacks – unreasonable storing of the considerable amount of data and cache. What you should do is clear the cache and data, and check for changes in the app’s behavior. Hopefully, with that move, you’ll remove possible slowdowns that are a known culprit for this issue. This is how to clear cache and data from the Facebook app: </p>
<p> Tap Apps. </p>
<p> Navigate to Facebook app. </p>
<p> Tap to open Options. </p>
<p> Restart your device and try out Facebook app again. </p>
<p> If the sudden crashes are still there, the reinstallation is the next obvious step. </p>
<p> Reinstall the Facebook app </p>
<p> Well, with the reinstallation you should get the latest version and clean cache/data in a more manageable manner. However, you’ll need to set up your preferences again after the reinstallation is completed. This is how to manage Facebook reinstallation process: </p>
<p> Tap and hold the Facebook app and move it to the top of the screen to uninstall it. </p>
<p> Enable Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Tap Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for Facebook. </p>
<p> However, if the current version is malfunctioning on your device and the previous was working just fine, check the next step. </p>
<p> Download older Facebook app version </p>
<p> If you’re keen to use Facebook’s official app but the latest changes made havoc, you can download an APK and use older app’s versions. It’s easier if your phone is rooted, but it doesn’t matter if it isn’t. Follow these steps to obtain and install an earlier version of the Facebook app: </p>
<p> Download the wanted version’s APK here on your PC. </p>
<p> Extract the file until you have the APK file. </p>
<p> Connect the Android device to the PC via USB and transfer the APK file to internal memory. </p>
<p> Uninstall the current Facebook app and restart your device. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced settings > Security, and enable Unknown sources. </p>
<p> Use File Explorer or a similar app to navigate to the folder where the APK file is stored. </p>
<p> Tap to install the APK with the older version. </p>
<p> After the process is finished, make sure not to install updates for the Facebook app. </p>
<p> But, in case you’re over your head with the shenanigans of the official Facebook app, you still have an alternative to access your favorite social network. </p>
<p> Use an alternative wrapper apps </p>
<p> A lot of people decided that enough is enough and switched to ‘wrappers’, the 3rd-party alternatives that have similar features like the original app but with better performance and optimization. However, that comes at the cost. Some of them have ads and you’ll need the Pro version to get rid of them. On the other hand, others may be too feature-slim for someone’s taste. But, most of the time, with the wrapper, you can get rid of Facebook Messenger, too. Two birds with the one stone. </p>
<p> Additionally, you can log into Facebook via a browser, like Chrome, Opera, or Mozilla. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings </p>
<p> At the end, if you’ve developed some kind of emotion for the official Facebook app, you can try and perform factory settings. This is the last step and too often it’s not worth performing. Namely, as you already know, with the factory reset you lost all of your data. All that effort put in the hope that, after the fresh system starts, your Facebook will work as intended. More times than not, it won’t help you. </p>
<p> However, if you’re keen to try it out, this is how to reset your Android device to factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Tap Factory data reset. </p>
<p> After that, the phone will restart and, the next time it starts, all settings and data will be renewed. Now you can download the Facebook (if it’s not already preinstalled on your device), and check for changes. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. The Facebook app crashes are not exactly something you would expect from the premium developers working for Facebook. However, maybe they’ll reassure us in the near future. </p>
<p> What is your experience with the Facebook app? Do you have any alternative solutions for crashes issue? </p>
<p> Make sure to tell us in the comments. We’ll appreciate it. </p>

<p> This sort of problem should not be happening. Can you actually imagine if you added all the time spent by millions of users? it actually doesn’t make any sense at all, in fact it’s bordering on total incompetence across the board. i hate facebooknand any other d**k wipe app that supposedly helps us through the day when in actual no apps help at all. So called app designers need to go back to programming school and app designers need to sing of the same hymn sheet. </p>

<p> Hi Manuela, I’m sorry you’re experiencing troubles with your Facebook client. I’m pretty sure none of the solutions we offered above can make things worse. You probably installed a buggy update. Just wait for some time, Facebook will surely release a patch soon. Regards </p>

<p> Is it time for Facebook to rethink its Messenger strategy? </p>
<p> The modern society is too often taking extreme sides when glorifying/criticizing something. And, it seems that, at least in most cases, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. The same principle can be applied to Facebook. The most popular social network in the world which owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR is a force to be reckoned. The well-oiled machine that affects the world more than we can imagine and too often not in a good way. </p>
<p> In our opinion, one of the Facebook’s complete shortcoming is the Facebook Messenger app. Since August 2014, Facebook suddenly decided to dismiss the standard messaging and forcibly push Facebook messaging towards the Instant messaging category. Following the model of the widely acclaimed WhatsApp, they created the mandatory app that users need to download in order to stay in contact with their friends. Some may say that the optional 3rd-party app would be a much more subtle approach to millions of users. </p>
<p> Moreover, once they’ve acquired WhatsApp, they basically got themselves the proven Instant Messenger model for the future development of their own app. But, thing is, they failed to create anything similar in quality, but rather created a steroid-injected Frankenstein app. The jack of all trades but the master of none, resource-hogging, permission-misusing instant messenger. And the Facebook app isn’t exactly the peak of the app development itself. The detailed explanation for this seemingly uncalled rant is below. </p>
<p> The Assassination of the Battery by the coward Facebook Messenger </p>
<p> Now, this isn’t the same for all app’s versions or even for all devices. But, there are so many reported cases of the battery leaks provoked by the good old Facebook Messenger. The app is made to be quite resistant to any system’s boundaries, hard to retain with all those bubbles and additional roles it can take if granted. Like SMS or Call integration, for example. It works in the background and independently from the Facebook app itself. </p>
<p> That’s the main reason a lot of users decided to use the 3rd-party wrappers for the Facebook app and the obscure Messenger alternatives in order to preserve their battery life. Now, someone may say that this is not uncommon for a plentitude of other apps, but this is THE app. One would expect from the Facebook team to better optimize their mobile solution, make it a lighter, more appealing for all the users. Facebook messaging is used both by the folks with the flagships and with the low-budget devices. </p>
<p> And I can seemingly run WhatsApp both on my Huawei P9 and Samsung Galaxy S2. Facebook Messenger? Not so much. </p>
<p> All those permissions and their background </p>
<p> When it comes to permissions the app acquires from a user, the list is quite long and basically covers all of the possible outputs on a single device. Starting with the camera and microphone, moving trough contacts, SMS and your location. Of course, after the Android Lolipop OS, users are able to prevent unwanted permissions individually within the app settings. The same goes for iOS users. However, for those who still run Android 5, that isn’t possible without the additional tools. </p>
<p> People tend to exaggerate a bit when it comes to a privacy intrusion and Facebook Messenger. A lot of experts are convincing the wide population that Facebook Messenger is perfectly safe to use. However, it’s advised to use it simply as a Facebook Messenger and limit its permissions. But, sometimes, the conspiracy theories are on point and, as we all know, Facebook isn’t famous for their privacy protection. As an old saying goes: ”If You’re Not Paying For It, You Become The Product”. </p>
<p> Facebook indeed added the end-to-end encryption but they made it optional and not in the plain sight. So, how many users are going to start their spontaneous chats under the Secret Conversation? Not so much, if you ask me. </p>
<p> New features, more annoyance </p>
<p> You don’t need to be so well-informed to catch the agenda behind Facebook acquisitions after you see the uncanny resemblance between WhatsApp and the Facebook Messenger. They are similar but one is well-designed and user-friendly instant messenger while the other one is just a bad copy. Now, by following that path, they decided to add Instagram Stories to Facebook Messenger. So, if you’re unprepared, the home page will strike you with an abundance of features, and most of those are not useful at all. </p>
<p> Now, why trade the simplicity of standard instant messenger and add Stories to an already confusing app? To make things worse, they are bombarding users with suggested contacts, suggested birthdays and groups. If you make a slide from bottom to top, that will summon the camera ready to catch your untold Story. And someone thought the Instagram is well suited for those. If you decide to use it as the SMS client, most of the time you’ll have a hard time finding what you need in that cluttered surroundings. </p>
<p> Instead of working on improvements for Facebook calls that are unreliable, or improving the privacy protection, Facebook offers stickers and colored chat windows like some groundbreaking revolution in the field. In all honesty, that is not enough from the leader in that field. </p>
<p> Wrap Up </p>
<p> At the end, due to the number of users, Facebook Messenger will alway be used and even liked. But, to me, it seems a bit like a Stockholm syndrome. Eventually, you’ll get to like it even though it was uncalled for most of us. Finally, the majority of people just want to send and receive messages from our Facebook friends in an uncluttered way from the secure app. Is it too much to ask for? </p>
<p> What are your opinions on Facebook Messenger? Do you agree or have issues with it, as well? </p>

<p> Fix: Alarm doesn’t work in iOS 10 </p>
<p> In approximately 10 years, Apple introduced 10 upgraded variations of iPhone and 10 main iOS versions. Since the first iPhone was launched back in 2007, the world witnessed an astonishing evolution of both hardware and software solutions. However, even though iPhone 7 has all of that flashy options, remarkable interface, and advanced hardware to run everything smoothly, sometimes the most basic things won’t work. </p>
<p> We already talked about iOS 10.2 common issues, reported by large audiences. But, this problem we bump into is an annoyance by itself. It is on the same level with the unclear sound from the speaker in calls. It is the Alarm malfunction. And those are elementary things, options that are present for 20 years in all mobile phones. Even the ones that are not ‘smart’. </p>
<p> We prepared some solutions, albeit we hope that Apple will address this problem with the upcoming updates. </p>
<p> How to fix Alarm issue on iOS 10 </p>
<p> Delete all Alarms, reboot, then set them up again </p>
<p> In some cases, this bug can be fixed in few simple steps: </p>
<p> Mark and delete all alarms. </p>
<p> Follow the same path and set again preferred alarms. </p>
<p> Adjust the Volume </p>
<p> Alarm volume is the same as the Ringer one. So you should raise the volume using your physical button while on the Home Screen. Alternatively, you can follow this path: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Sounds. </p>
<p> In Ringer and Alert slider, slide right. </p>
<p> Now your alarm volume should be fine. </p>
<p> Restore your phone as a New iPhone </p>
<p> Restoring your phone is a hard doing, especially when you are starting from the scratch. All of your settings and content will be lost. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All Content and Settings. </p>
<p> Confirm action. </p>
<p> After everything is deleted, set up your phone until the App & Data screen shows up. </p>
<p> Tap Setup as New iPhone. </p>
<p> Now you can start from the beginning, and try out your Alarm again. </p>
<p> Update your phone </p>
<p> Make sure that your iOS version is up to date. Maybe, with updating, your problem suddenly resolves. Therefore, follow this path to check your iOS version. </p>
<p> First and foremost, backup your phone before updating. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Choose Software Update. </p>
<p> If the update is available, download and install. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Even though we are overwhelmed with an abundance of options, smartphone producers sometimes neglect important simple options used on daily basis. Our advice to you is to buy yourself a standard, classic Alarm clock. It is cheap and you won’t be late for work. </p>
<p> If you managed to solve your issues with a different approach, please share it with us in the comment section. </p>

<p> Fix: Battery drains on iOS 14 </p>
<p> iOS 14 introduces all kinds of new features that make the users excited to download Apple’s latest OS. The redesigned Home Screen mechanics, changing default apps, and of course, widgets are just a few new features that make iOS 14 the most enticing iOS update in years. </p>
<p> And while most users love the new options, there are still those who aren’t excited about iOS 14. Mostly because they had some needless problems caused by the latest update. </p>
<p> The battery drain is one of the most frequent issues. Social media sites and multiple forums on iOS 14 are currently flooded with reports of poor battery life. If you’ve also noticed the decrease, I’m sure you’ll want to get things back to normal, or at least grasp what’s going on better. So, here we’ll try to clarify the situation and maybe find a viable solution. </p>
<p> Just wait… </p>
<p> As ZDNet’s Adrian Kingsley-Hughes points out, the worse battery life on a freshly-installed OS is more a rule than an exception. When you install a big update, like iOS 14, your phone has to do a lot of background work to get everything in order. </p>
<p> First, there’s battery calibration and indexing. These processes use more battery on their own, so that’s when the “initial” drain will probably happen. On top of that, a recalibrated battery can give you the impression that it drains faster when in reality it doesn’t. </p>
<p> Then, there are all those pending app updates. A new major iOS version is also a big thing for developers who’ve been improving their apps to work better with iOS 14. So naturally, most of your apps will receive updates within a few days of installing the new OS. </p>
<p> And, of course, the most probable reason for bad battery life on your iPhone: Bugs. We already know that the release of iOS 14 was a bit hurried by Apple, which led to all kinds of problems. First of all, there’s possibly something that triggers battery drainage within the iOS 14 code. On top of that, as developers didn’t have enough time to polish their apps, your iPhone’s battery life could also be shortened by an unoptimized third-party app. </p>
<p> So, with all these factors in mind, is there anything you can do to deal with the draining battery? Well, not so much. You can either sit and wait for Apple to release a fixing update or delete an app you assume consumes more power than usual (we’ll talk about it in a bit). </p>
<p> In the meantime, there are a few workarounds that will not fix the battery draining issue per se, but will at least give you some control over your iPhone’s power usage, so waiting for that sanative update won’t be as hard. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Keep Low Power mode enabled </p>
<p> The signature battery-saving feature of the iPhone is its Low Power Mode. As you can tell from its name, when you enable this mode, your phone pauses all the battery-consuming background processes, like updating apps, syncing to iCloud, Background App Refresh, etc. By putting all these tasks on hold the phone consumes less power, hence the name. </p>
<p> By default, you’ll get the prompt to enable Low Power mode each time your battery percentage goes below 20%. But you can also manually activate it at any time, and your phone will remain in this “state” until you turn it back off, or until the battery percentage reaches at least 80% when charging. </p>
<p> To turn Low Power mode on go to Settings > Battery, and toggle the Low Power Mode option on. </p>
<p> Now, I know keeping Low Power mode constantly on can be frustrating (I personally find it very annoying), because your iPhone won’t be able to perform some basic functions, but it should theoretically extend your daily mileage until the fix arrives. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Turn off Location Services </p>
<p> You’d be surprised to learn how many apps installed on your phone actually want to know your location. And to do so, each app needs to interact with iPhone’s Location Services, which is battery-consuming. </p>
<p> We’re not talking privacy here, but you should keep those apps in check for technical reasons, as well. While you probably won’t notice any difference when the battery situation is “normal”, keeping the Location Services usage in check could be very helpful in times like this. </p>
<p> You have two options here. Either deny access to Location Services to apps you don’t think really need it, or disable Location Services altogether. Whatever you choose, here’s how to do it </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Privacy > Location Services. </p>
<p> Here you can disable Location Services as a whole, or control each app’s usage of this feature individually. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Delete power-consuming apps </p>
<p> IOS has made it so simple, easy, and even aesthetically stunning to use apps on the iPhone that we barely pay attention to what’s going on in the background. And we’re not supposed to, that’s the whole point of it. Apple’s job is to take care of the technicalities, yours is just to enjoy the end product. </p>
<p> But if you take the extra step and look under the hood (as much as Apple allows it), you could find some extra insight into how you use your apps. Of course, I’m talking, of course, about an app that could eat up your battery without you even knowing it. This is especially possible in the early days of a new iOS, since not every app has been updated to work seamlessly on the latest version. </p>
<p> But you use so many apps, how can you figure out which app uses more power than it should and whether that app even exists? Well, there’s no direct way, but you can use iOS battery reporting to get the closest idea. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Battery. On this page, you’ll get detailed reports of your battery use for up to 10 days back. The best thing about this report is that it gives you battery usage by app, which is essential for our little investigation. Go through the list of apps carefully to see if you can find one that uses more battery than it does usually. If you identify such an app, your best bet is probably to delete that app and wait for its developer to deliver an updated version that won’t drain the battery on iOS 14. </p>
<p> Tip: Pay special attention to the background activity of apps. If an app constantly does something in the background, it’s probably a good idea to remove it for some time. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Background App Refresh </p>
<p> As the name suggests, Background App Refresh is a feature that allows apps, even if you are not actually using them, to update and search for new content. This makes for a smooth experience, as you don’t have to wait for an app to load every time you switch back to it. </p>
<p> But as convenient as this feature is, it still consumes battery. A tiny chunk tho, but it might be noticeable when your battery life isn’t at its best. So, you can turn off this feature and see if the battery improves. </p>
<p> The obvious downside here is that you can’t seamlessly slide through apps anymore, as you’ll have to wait for each app to load new content. This will slightly slow you down and your iPhone won’t feel as fast, but the battery should last longer. </p>
<p> Here’s how to disable Background App Refresh in iOS 14: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to General > Background App Refresh. </p>
<p> Here you disable Background App Refresh completely of for individual apps. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Delete some widgets </p>
<p> Widgets are the biggest star of iOS 14. I’m almost positive most of you were caught by the “Home Screen fever” that has begun ravaging millions of iPhones starting September 16. I would’ve never thought that something as trivial as organizing Home Screen could turn into a legit competition for who’s going to be the most creative when arranging icons and widgets. </p>
<p> By the way, if you’ve created your own little piece of art on your Home Screen, feel free to share it with us in the comments, a lot of people would probably love to steal your ideas. </p>
<p> But, all the hype and creative work aside, there may be some widgets that are doing you more harm than good. At least for now. I keep blabbing about how Apple rushed iOS 14, leaving developers with little to no time to optimize their apps. Well, it’s possible that a certain app on your phone hasn’t been properly updated, which makes it, for example, eat more battery than it should. It’s unlikely, but still possible. </p>
<p> The only way you come close to finding out if that’s indeed the case is to get to the battery report (as shown in Solution 3). Once again, go through the list of apps and see if any of them is using an unusual amount of battery. If a widget of that app appears to be on your Home Screen maybe you found the culprit. So, perhaps instead of completely uninstalling that app, removing its widget form Home Screen would be enough. Just experiment and see what happens. </p>
<p> That would be all for our little investigation. I hope at least one of these tips will help you preserve some battery life. Until Apple gets its act together and delivers that fixing update, which is probably the only real solution to the battery draining problem. That can happen tomorrow or in a few months. We never know, so it’s a good idea to give your battery some remedy in the meantime. </p>
<p> You’ll probably sacrifice a feature or your iPhone’s signature smooth performance, but at least you won’t find it out of juice in the middle of your workday. </p>

<p> Fix: Battery indicator shows different percentage on Android </p>
<p> Have you ever being completely bamboozled by sudden changes in percentages shown by your battery indicator? This is quite a common thing after you’ve used a handset for an extended period of time. “But, why?”, you might ask. Well, we made sure to explain it below. </p>
<p> Even better, we provided you with a way to get precise readings on your device without too much hustle. </p>
<p> Why does the battery indicator show a different percentage? </p>
<p> The reasons behind these erratic battery readings are mostly the battery being uncalibrated. Namely, after some time of use, batteries will degrade. The initial mAh capacity value will fall down over time. The device sensors would not be able to pick up on that and that’s why you’ll get a mixed percentage. </p>
<p> So, for example, your battery might be at 90% and then it suddenly, in a matter of minutes, switches to 80%. And then it’s stuck at 80% for an extended period of time. It’s impossible for a battery to deplete that fast, which points towards false readings. </p>
<p> There are certain third-party apps that can give you better wear details about battery degradation. But that’s of no big importance in the grand scheme of things. The important thing to do is to recalibrate the battery. We explain how to do it below. </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and wait until it turns off.. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a wall socket, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your device. </p>
<p> Turn your device on. If the battery percentage is not at 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> After that, readings of the battery percentage should be more on point. In order to keep battery readings precise, we recommend recalibrating battery every 2 months by following the aforementioned procedure. </p>
<p> In case you have any questions or suggestions concerning battery calibration, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<p> Fix: Unable to connect car’s Media System and Android via Bluetooth </p>
<p> Pairing your Android phone and your car’s media system via Bluetooth is of great use, both for handsfree purposes and media streaming. But, we found reports of some awkward issues concerning playback while trying to connect Nougat 7.0 device with car media system. </p>
<p> Car and Android won’t connect via Bluetooth </p>
<p> One of the members of the XDA forum has stated that his Huawei Mate 9 can pair with his car but playback won’t start every time. He is concerned with its erratic behavior. Supposedly, phone pairs with every other device except the car. </p>
<p> Another member is having trouble with the similar problem. Devices can pair but, while music is playing, handsfree mode won’t react to incoming calls. </p>
<p> Well, there is one solution that can be of use if you have the same issue on your Android. </p>
<p> Swiftly delete the device from pairing list and retry </p>
<p> Sometimes the cure for the problem is easier than it seems. To do that follow these instructions. </p>
<p> 1. Go to Settings > Wireless and Networks > Bluetooth </p>
<p> 2. Turn your Bluetooth ON </p>
<p> 3. In the list of paired devices select your car Bluetooth device </p>
<p> 4. Select Forget </p>
<p> 5. Then search for devices and select your car Bluetooth device </p>
<p> 6. Tap Pair </p>
<p> 7. If you are prompted for four digits PIN, enter it </p>
<p> Have in mind that some cars board computers have a special button that enables Bluetooth connection. </p>
<p> If this solution is not helpful, don’t worry. There is probably a bug in Nougat 7.0 that is making all this trouble. Luckily, it is said that solution will be available in a first update . Nougat 7.11 is here today so we hope that unpleasant experience with this problem has come to an end. </p>
<p> If you are having the same problem, please inform us in the comment section. Also, if you managed to solve it, let us know. Traveling to work without your favorite playlist is a thing no one should endure for long. </p>

<p> My mate 20 will not work to my Toyota RAV 4 media system. It connects fine and the phone works fine but it will not play music via Bluetooth or USB. </p>
<p> But I’ve tried with 3 types of iPhone and a Samsung S8 and they all connect 1st time and work OK. I’m lost now what to do and am assuming it’s just a flaw with huawei </p>

<p> FIXED – delete paired device from phone bluetooth, then switch bluetooth off and restarts your phone. Go to your car and select ‘paired devices’ and delete all of them, so it is empty. Then go to ‘pair device’ wait til it says ‘ready to pair with 4 digit pin code’, then switch on your bluetooth on your phone, it should show your car radio/media system, input the code, it’s paired, then should connect. It seems the first time you do it, it pairs but does not connect and then it doesn’t matter how many times you keep trying it won’t… Read more » </p>

<p> Fix: Bluetooth won’t work on Samsung Galaxy S8 </p>
<p> Samsung keeps on giving with its incredible line of flagship devices. While we’re awaiting the S9 to hit the global market, let’s not forget about the S8 and how well-developed handset it is. However, even though S8 checks all the boxes, there are some issues we can’t neglect. Today, we’ll try to address Bluetooth issue which is, surprisingly, quite common. </p>
<p> Namely, a hefty number of users reported a variety of Bluetooth errors — starting with the connection breaking and reaching to a complete inability to connect in the first place. In order to address this, we provided a list of most common solutions. If you’re a proud S8 user but Bluetooth aches won’t stop, make sure to check the steps we provided below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Update your device </p>
<p> First things first. Reset your phone? Done that to no avail? Ok, moving on. Even the manufacturer claims that the majority of seeming hardware issues are rather software bugs, and you can resolve them by simply updating your firmware. Now, we know that these updates are sometimes more of a problem than the solution, but there’s so much you can do with the outdated device nowadays. </p>
<p> In the Bluetooth case, we can say that the Bluetooth 5 data transfer protocol is a novelty and that the older devices will have a hard time pairing with it. Nonetheless, that doesn’t mean that, by adjusting the software, you won’t be able to connect your S8 to your car, headphones or PC. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to update your firmware on Samsung Galaxy S8: </p>
<p> Connect to a stable Wi-Fi network. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap System Update and check for updates. </p>
<p> If there’s an update available, make sure to install it as soon as possible. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Make sure that the pairing device can connect with S8 </p>
<p> This is the second side of the same coin. When it comes to Bluetooth, it’s important that both devices are compatible for pairing. Some older stereo systems or wireless speakers can have a hard time pairing with S8, just due to the incompatibility with the newer standard S8 enforces. </p>
<p> Therefore, make sure that the other device is compatible with S8 and, once you’re certain that it can, update its firmware, as well. Since this procedure is digressing from the smartphone area, we advise you to look it up and find how to do it on your system/device. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Forget all pairings and restart Bluetooth service </p>
<p> Let’s move to a sphere of our common understanding. As you already know, there’s no a limitation on devices you can pair with. You can pair with one, a few, or dozens — it’ll give you the same result. However, since Android stores the data of every paired device, this can, in some sense, invoke Bluetooth issues. </p>
<p> In order to address this, we advise you to completely remove all pairings and restart Bluetooth’s system service. If you’re unsure how to do it, please follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Tap Paired devices. </p>
<p> Tap the cog-like settings icon and choose Unpair/Forget. </p>
<p> Now, get back to Settings and open Application manager. </p>
<p> Click on the upper-right menu and Show system processes. </p>
<p> Open Bluetooth Application Manager and clear cache and data. </p>
<p> Restart your S8 and look for changes. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Disable NFC and Wi-Fi </p>
<p> This is a commonly recommended step for fixing Bluetooth issues. Namely, the premise is that the frequencies of other wireless data transfer methods affect Bluetooth. In this case, those are NFC and Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> It’s still a long shot, but you can at least try. So, before you enable Bluetooth radio on your S8, disable both NFC and Wireless. This can simply be done by swiping down the panel and tapping both NFC and Wi-Fi, respectively. Once you’ve done it, try reconnecting with Bluetooth and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reset Network settings </p>
<p> Even though there’s only so much it can wrong concerning network settings — Bluetooth settings in this particular case — you can try and reset them to factory settings. Namely, we are trying to avoid complete factory restore, and this is a good way to resolve connectivity issues while keeping your data intact. </p>
<p> In case you can’t find your way on your own, these steps should show you how to reset network settings on Samsung Galaxy S8: </p>
<p> Open Backup and reset. </p>
<p> Locate Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> Tap on Reset Network settings to confirm the selection and restart your device. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> If you run into any kind of issue with your handset and looked up for solutions, there’s a good chance that someone recommended wiping cache partition. As you might have heard, the internal storage has a special partition which deals with the temporary cache files. These files speed up the loading time and enable your Android OS to load faster. </p>
<p> However, they might as well, after some time, pile up and cause issues with various services. In this scenario, the abundance or corruption of cache in the dedicated partition might have broken Bluetooth. </p>
<p> By wiping cache partition on your S8, you should be able to resolve the error. Also, don’t worry about losing your data. Only the Factory reset will relieve you of everything you stored on your device. </p>
<p> If you’re not sure how to wipe cache partition on Galaxy S8, follow the instructions provided below: </p>
<p> Power off the device. </p>
<p> Press and hold continually Power button + Home button + Volume Down key until the Logo screen appears. </p>
<p> Use Volume keys to locate Wipe cache partition in the Recovery menu. </p>
<p> Press Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Choose ”Yes” and press Power button again. </p>
<p> Your device will restart and start the procedure. </p>
<p> Once the cache partition is wiped, try connecting via Bluetooth again. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Run the device in the Safe mode </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous solutions failed to satisfy, we can recommend trying running your device in Safe Mode. This way you’ll basically eliminate the handset’s software from the equation. Basically, if you’re still unable to pair with other devices via Bluetooth, it’s safe to say that either that opposite device is the culprit or the hardware is the one which needs a thorough inspection. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to boot Samsung Galaxy S8 in Safe Mode: </p>
<p> Turn off your S8. </p>
<p> Press and hold Power button past the initial screen, until it reaches Samsung logo. </p>
<p> Immediately after you release Power button, press and hold Volume Down key until the device restarts in the Safe mode. You should see the ”Safe mode” inscription. </p>
<p> Try using Bluetooth in Safe mode. If it works, uninstall lately installed Bluetooth-dependant apps. If it doesn’t work, make sure to call your handset vendor or carrier. </p>
<p> That’s it. In case you have questions or suggestions of some kind, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: Facebook Messenger crashes on iOS </p>
<p> Facebook Messenger is one of the most used apps on iOS, and those numbers somewhat come from a fact that Facebook users are forced to use it in order to chat with their Facebook friends. Now, even though we’re talking about one feature-rich instant messenger, it’s hard to overlook a multitude of drawbacks it has. </p>
<p> Frequent crashes are right there at the top. Taking into consideration the behavior and overall performance of other mainstream instant messengers on iOS, Facebook Messenger crashes are a strange occurrence. But, we assure you that is a problem that can be dealt with it. One way or another. </p>
<p> So, in order to help you, we prepared a few workarounds that should lead you through the troubleshooting procedure. In case you have experienced crashes on your iPhone or iPad, make sure to check the list below. </p>
<p> How to resolve Facebook Messenger crashes in iOS </p>
<p> Restart your device </p>
<p> Sometimes, the solution to your problem might be much simpler than it looks. Namely, if you don’t have jailbroken device, a multitude of iOS issues are easily resolved by a simple restart. It goes the same for iPhone and iPad. Something is stuck or misbehaving > restart your device > enjoy again in a seamless use of remarkable OS. Or something similar to that. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to restart iPhone/iPad: </p>
<p> Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button. </p>
<p> After it appears, use the slider to turn your device Off. </p>
<p> After the device turns off, use Sleep/Wake button to turn it ON again. </p>
<p> Update iOS </p>
<p> Updating iOS is another workaround that helped on so many occasions. If updates are available, of course. All apps are (or they should be, at least) optimized for the latest iOS version. Developers that care about their users tend to update their respective apps just after the iOS update and, therefore, optimize it for the latest version. So, there might be the slightest chance that you don’t have the appropriate version of iOS in relation to Facebook Messenger version. </p>
<p> So, make sure to check for updates and this will, at least, reassure you, that the problem is rather in the app than within system. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open General. </p>
<p> Select Software Update. </p>
<p> If any update is available, choose Download & Install. </p>
<p> Update the app </p>
<p> We are all aware that there’s no perfect OS and the same goes for apps. One would suspect that the Facebook Messenger app is, solely due to a fact that it’s provided by Facebook itself, at least above average. Well, that’s just untrue. One of the most used apps worldwide is still lacking stability and it looks that, even though it packs formidable amount of features, it isn’t getting better. Even the iOS version. However, maybe, and just maybe, the next update is going to clear a bug you confronted which caused chaotic crashes. </p>
<p> Because of that, it’s safe to say that updating is, no matter how much trivial it sounds, one of the workarounds you should take into consideration. </p>
<p> Tap App Store. </p>
<p> Open Updates. </p>
<p> If there are updates available, make sure to install them. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app </p>
<p> And if an updated version isn’t available or it has introduced some new tweak rather than addressing the issues, you might want to move to reinstallation. Rarely, some apps can show certain signs of misbehaving and reinstallation should sort things out. Moreover, it will cost you almost nothing, with exception time you spent to sign in. </p>
<p> On the app screen, tap and hold the Facebook Messenger app until the X appears. </p>
<p> Tap X to uninstall the app. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Open App Store and search for Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> Tap and install the app. </p>
<p> Use alternative apps instead of Facebook Messenger </p>
<p> Now, Facebook Messenger might have grown on you, and that’s an understandable thing. But, if it entered the phase where nothing of previous features works as intended, you might consider a replacement. Feature-wise, there’s hardly any app that is similar to official Facebook Messenger. However, while alternatives lack some things, they may provide you with the stability and uncluttered interface – something that, sadly, Facebook Messenger seems to lack. You should look out for some wrappers like Friendly or Puffin. </p>
<p> Or, at the end, you can use Safari browser, create a home screen shortcut and use the desktop version of Facebook without the complications whatsoever. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps helped you resolve the issue with the notorious Facebook Messenger and you’re keen to use it no matter what, maybe the factory reset is a viable solution. We won’t recommend it, just because of sheer waste of time for something that, arguably, get’s worse every time. </p>
<p> But, if you’re up for a restore, here are 2 ways you can do it: </p>
<p> Install the latest version of iTunes app on your PC. </p>
<p> Connect your device to a PC. </p>
<p> Start iTunes and choose Summary. </p>
<p> Remember to backup your iPhone data. </p>
<p> Select Restore iPhone. </p>
<p> That should be it. The comments section below is reserved for your questions or additional issue reports. Make sure to leave a comment and thank you for reading. </p>

<p> Full Guide: Fix common FaceTime issues in iOS </p>
<p> FaceTime has been one of the most popular iPhone/Mac features for years now. And for a good reason. The service allows users to make video calls without using a third-party app. It’s a convenient way to see your family, do business or just chat with your friends. </p>
<p> Now, FaceTime issues are not so common, because Apple works on it along with other built-in system features. Hence, the updates are quite frequent, and if the problem is on Apple, you’ll get a workaround relatively quickly. </p>
<p> But no app is perfect, and neither is FaceTime. Although not as frequent, FaceTime issues do occur from time to time. And if you’re facing a certain problem right now, we got you covered. </p>
<p> This article features basically any reported FaceTime issue we could find. So, just take a look at the table of contents, find the problem that’s bothering you and start troubleshooting! Rember, if you don’t resolve the problem right away, try some of the solutions for other problems, as well. It’s the same app we’re talking about, after all. </p>
<p> Fix – FaceTime not working </p>
<p> We’re going to start with some generic solutions that can be applied to most of the FaceTime problems. Also, if you’re not sure what the problem is, but you’re still unable to use FaceTime normally, you can try some of these solutions. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check if FaceTime is down </p>
<p> Since FaceTime uses Apple’s dedicated servers, a certain interference could prevent the service from working. In other words, if Apple’s servers are temporarily down, you won’t be able to use FaceTime (or any other service dependent on servers). </p>
<p> If the server is indeed down, you don’t need to worry. Apple is super efficient when it comes to this kind of problems. So, a server outage will probably last for a short period of time. Most likely for a few minutes or hours. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check your internet connection </p>
<p> If there’s something wrong with your internet connection, you obviously won’t be able to use FaceTime. Some of the things you can try here is switching to a WiFi connection (from the cellular connection), reconnecting to a network, rebooting your phone, etc. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you can’t figure out what causes connection issues, you might as well reset the Network Settings. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> You might also want to check if FaceTime is even enabled. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to the Settings app from your Home screen. </p>
<p> Tap FaceTime. </p>
<p> If FaceTime is off, tap the switch next to FaceTime to turn it on. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Update the system </p>
<p> As I mentioned above, Apple frequently delivers FaceTime patches through system updates. So, if the problem you’re currently facing is widespread and acknowledged by developers, you’ll get a patch soon. Just make sure you check for updates every now and then. </p>
<p> Fix – FaceTime activation / sign in error </p>
<p> If you’re unable to activate FaceTime, the issue probably lays in the network connection. Or you’re improperly signed in with to iCloud. Either way, you can try the following solutions: </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Sign out of iCloud </p>
<p> To sign out of your iCloud account, do the following: </p>
<p> Tap the Apple ID banner at the top of the screen. </p>
<p> Enter the password for your iCloud Apple ID. </p>
<p> Now, uncheck each type of data you want to keep on your iPhone. </p>
<p> Tap Sign Out and confirm. </p>
<p> Now, restart your device, and sign in to your iCloud account once again. Once you’re done, try activating FaceTime once again, and see if the problem is resolved. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Reset network settings </p>
<p> If you’re still unable to connect, you can try with resetting network settings: </p>
<p> FaceTime is also connected to time and date services on your device. So, if one is set wrong, you’ll have problems using TimeFace. In case you got the wrong time/date on your device, go ahead and change it: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General > Date & Time. </p>
<p> Make sure both time, date, and time zone are set correctly. </p>
<p> You can also turn on the Set Automatically option, so you don’t have to worry about incorrect time anymore. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Enable Location services </p>
<p> Similarly to time and date, FaceTime also need to use the location services to determine your location. If you have this option off, go and switch it back on: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Privacy > Location Services. </p>
<p> Scroll down, and find FaceTime. </p>
<p> Tap FaceTime and choose one of the following options: While Using the App or Always. </p>
<p> Fix – FaceTime camera not working </p>
<p> If the camera doesn’t work when you’re in the app, it’s likely an ‘outside’ problem. So, make sure to install all the necessary updates, especially if the changelog features some camera improvements. </p>
<p> On top of that, some users also recommend closing all other apps that use the camera, to prevent any possible interferences. </p>
<p> Fix – FaceTime poor connection </p>
<p> Just like it’s the case with camera, poor internet connection in FaceTime isn’t caused by the app itself 99% of the time. So, just try some common internet connection troubleshooting methods like we already discussed in this article. That includes switching to a WiFi connection from cellular, resetting network settings (look above for the instructions), reconnecting to a network, etc. </p>
<p> Additionally, check if the FaceTime server is running properly. </p>
<p> Fix – FaceTime audio not working </p>
<p> As silly as it might sound, the first thing you should try is to check if you haven’t muted the person you’re facetiming with inside the app. </p>
<p> Additionally, if any of the conversation participants have the Do Not Disturb mode on, sound issues may occur. To turn the Do Not Disturb mode off, go to Settings > Do Not Disturb and turn it off. </p>
<p> On top of that, if you’re using your AirPods (or any other Bluetooth headphones) while on FaceTime, make sure FaceTime is properly connected and doesn’t send the sound signal to some other Bluetooth device nearby. </p>
<p> Fix – FaceTime upside down </p>
<p> This silly issue usually occurs if your compass isn’t calibrated properly. To re-calibrate compass in iOS, do the following: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Privacy > Location Services. </p>
<p> Select System Services at the bottom of the apps list. </p>
<p> Turn Compass calibration On. </p>
<p> If turning the compass calibration on didn’t resolve the problem, maybe the phone rotation is just messing with you. So, make sure you go to Control Center, and turn Screen rotation off. </p>
<p> Fix – FaceTime no video or black screen </p>
<p> This problem is quite rare, so if you’re experiencing a black screen or can’t see the video while using FaceTime, chances are a recent update messed it up. In that case, the only thing you can really do is just wait for Apple to release a followup update. </p>
<p> If you don’t want to wait, you can as well check your internet connection (as explained above), or reset the settings. </p>
<p> Fix – FaceTime call failed </p>
<p> There are a lot of reasons for failed calls in FaceTime. But most of the time, it’s the internet connection problem. So, you can try resetting the network settings, as explained above. </p>
<p> On the other hand, it doesn’t mean your device is the problem after all. Maybe there’s a problem on the other side. Here are some of the most common reasons your call have failed: </p>
<p> The person you’re trying to call doesn’t have a FaceTime-compatible device. </p>
<p> He/she doesn’t have FaceTime configured properly. </p>
<p> He/she has their device on Do Not Disturb. </p>
<p> He/she is not on a wifi network at this time. </p>
<p> He/she is already on another FaceTime call. </p>
<p> Fix – FaceTime crashes </p>
<p> Just like it’s the case with any other app, FaceTime will usually crash when the system is overloaded. So, make sure to close some apps you’re not using at the moment, and try to open FaceTime once again. </p>
<p> Some other things you can do is resetting the phone settings, and of course, update the system. Once again, if the problem is widespread, the patch should be on its way. </p>
<p> To reset the phone settings, go to Settings> General > Reset > Reset All Settings. Keep in mind that all your settings will get reset, so make sure to create a backup before you do this. </p>
<p> That’s about it, as you can see we wanted to cover as many issues if possible. But in case there’s something missing, don’t hesitate to share the problem with us in the comments below. </p>

<p> Fix: Google Photos not syncing with Google Drive </p>
<p> Even though it isn’t as homogenous as iOS, Android, with its unified Google apps isn’t far behind. You can use one account to connect various services, including the limitless Google Photos and not-so-limitless Google Drive. Basically, every photo stored on both physical phone storage or Google Drive can be synced. </p>
<p> Now, in theory, that’s a sweet song of love, but in practical use, you can run into a problem or two occasionally. One of the reported issues is failed sync from Google Drive to Google Photos. Simply put, even though user set Google Photos to sync from Google Drive, they just fail to appear. For that purpose, we conducted a thorough research and brought to you a few workarounds that should relieve you of the issue at hand. </p>
<p> So, if you’ve had a hard time with Google Drive photos syncing to Google Photos service, make sure to check the solutions below. </p>
<p> Enable ”Show Google Drive photos and videos in your Photos Library” </p>
<p> In order to see the photos that you’ve already backed up on Google Drive in your Google Photos library, you’ll need to enable this option first. It’s disabled by default so you’ll need to navigate to Settings and toggle it on. There are some things to know before we move to this step. Namely, once you’ve enabled this feature, you can freely delete or edit synced photos without a fear of losing them from Google Drive. </p>
<p> Now, let’s find our way to Settings and enable the above-mentioned feature: </p>
<p> Open Google Photos app. </p>
<p> Tap the three-line menu and scroll down to Settings. </p>
<p> Toggle on ”Show Google Drive photos and videos in your Photos Library”. </p>
<p> Wait for some time (up to 24 hours) for photos to sync. It depends on your bandwidth and quantity and quality of photos stored on Google Drive. </p>
<p> After that, you should be able to access Google Drive photos on Google Photos app. Both on your Android and PC. However, if you run into additional problems, don’t despair. There are some additional steps you could use to resolve the issue. </p>
<p> Check the connection </p>
<p> If you’ve already enabled Google Drive photos on Google Photos Library and those still fail to sync, it just may be the connectivity issue. There’s a simple way to ensure yourself that the unstable connection is the cause of the problem. Follow the instructions below to check for issues: </p>
<p> Open Google photos. </p>
<p> Tap the Assistant card. </p>
<p> If you’re prompted with the message that informs you that there’s no connection or that the process awaits for Wi-Fi, the problem is most certainly related to connectivity. </p>
<p> If you’re on the move and you have a lot of free data to spend, you can enable the sync with Mobile Data. But, we won’t advise you to do so on a regular basis since it can prove as an expensive and rather slow way. Wait for the stable Wi-Fi connection or follow these steps to troubleshoot connectivity on your device: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and re-establish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz. It lacks range, but it’s a more stable option. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition within Recovery settings. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Clear app cache and data </p>
<p> Occasionally, the problem might be just related to a small stall within the app. Due to frequent changes that are made to the app through updates, there’s a chance that something within settings is failing, and thus, blocking sync between 2 services. Now, as you’re probably aware, the best way to restart an Android app is to clear its Stored Data. </p>
<p> This can be done by following these simple instructions: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Apps. </p>
<p> Navigate to Google Photos and Google Drive, respectively. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> Tap Clear Data. </p>
<p> Restart your handset and try syncing again. </p>
<p> Have in mind that you might need to enter your Google Account credentials again in order to access the Google-related apps. </p>
<p> Update the app </p>
<p> If you’re still stuck with the same error and unable to reach Google Drive photos and videos in Google Photo Library, the next obvious step is to update. This mostly goes for users that have had experienced issues after the OS upgrade. With the update, you’ll have the latest optimized version of the app, which should clear some issues. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to reinstall the app: </p>
<p> Connect to Wi-Fi and open Play Store. </p>
<p> Tap the 3-line menu and open ”My apps & games”. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> If there’s an update available for either Google Photos or Google Drive (or both, for that matter), make sure to install them. </p>
<p> Try on a computer </p>
<p> Finally, if everything fell short, you can always use Google features on your personal computer and access your photos from there. Just open a browser and navigate to this Google Photos. Sign in with your Google Account credentials and make sure to enable Google Drive in Google Photos Library. It should be easier to do so than it was on your Android. </p>
<p> With that, we conclude today’s how-to. Make sure to share with us your experience or ask a question in the comments section below. Have a nice day and thanks for reading. </p>

<p> Fix: Google Voice Typing not working on Android </p>
<p> Google Voice Typing is an amazing voice-to-text engine that allows users to dictate words and sentences instead of typing them. However, Google Voice Typing is seemingly not working for some users. </p>
<p> Follow the steps below to sort out whatever is wrong with Google Voice Typing on your Android handset. </p>
<p> Google voice typing doesn’t work </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Make sure Google Voice Typing is enabled </p>
<p> First of all, make sure that Google Voice Typing is enabled in the first place. There might be a pre-installed service that replaces it on your device. We suggest switching to Google and ensuring that it’s enabled under your keyboard settings. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open any app or search bar and tap to bring up the keyboard. </p>
<p> Choose Voice typing. </p>
<p> Toggle the Use voice typing option. </p>
<p> Now, navigate to Settings > Apps > Default apps. </p>
<p> Make sure that the current keyboard language layout fits the language you want to use on Google Voice Typing. If you want to add another language, navigate to Settings > System > Languages & input. Under the Manage Keyboards, open Settings. Once there, check the boxes next to languages you want to use with Google Voice Typing. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Update apps and firmware </p>
<p> The next important thing to consider is keeping your device up-to-date. If an integral part of the Android system like this isn’t working, chances are that there’s either a bug in a keyboard app or the system itself. </p>
<p> Make sure to navigate to the Play Store and update all apps. Also, ensure that the firmware is up to date by navigating to Settings > System > System updates. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Download offline language </p>
<p> Finally, if you are using a different language than the system one, you’ll need to download offline package for that language. If you are online, you won’t have to, but we suggest it. </p>
<p> Also, you should ensure that the languages are up to date in order for Offline recognition to work. </p>
<p> Here’s how to download offline languages: </p>
<p> Repeat the steps from the first suggested solution until you get to Voice typing. </p>
<p> Under the Use voice typing option, open Offline speech recognition. </p>
<p> Add languages you want to add from the All list. Under the Auto-update tab, enable the Auto-update languages over Wi-Fi only option. </p>
<p> With that said, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and make sure to post your questions or suggestions in the comments section below.. </p>

<p> The issue is of of the recent updates. Reset the app GBoard by disabling it. The device will ask if you want to go back to the original app. Just say yes. The app will restart and voice typing will work again. </p>

<p> Google voice typing is blocking Gboard voice typing. Congrats developers!!! </p>
<p> settings->additional settings->Language&Input->Manage Keyboards->Google voice typing settings->Voice match->Hey Google Turn it off. “Access you assistant any time that you say “Hey Google” when your screen is on” When you turn it off your Gboard start listening your voice in keyboard when you press microphone. this is a huge and rude bug! </p>
<p> Perfect. As soon as hey Google is off, gboard voice typing became normal. Thanks ? </p>

<p> I have this issue suddenly. All settings are correct, apps updated, using SwiftKey keyboard… But the audio input button will not activate. I believe this is because I have never allowed or enabled Google assistant on this phone from day of purchase and actively denied all permissions because I do not trust or wish to comply with background data collection. So by doing this you lose a lot of “built in” or “standard” features nowadays. You either give up a piece of your privacy or you go ahead and type everything from now on. </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram won’t load on Android </p>
<p> If you are an active Instagram user, chances are you’ll run into some issues sooner or later. Even though both Android and iOS apps are stable most of the time, we got multiple reports about Instagram issues. Some users claim that Instagram won’t load no matter what they do. </p>
<p> This is a common issue (and a major one at that), so we made sure to provide you with applicable solutions. Follow the instructions closely and we should resolve the problem in no time. </p>
<p> Why is Instagram not opening on my phone? </p>
<p> There’s a variety of reasons why Instagram won’t load on your smartphone or tablet. Starting with possible global outage (those happened before) or connection problems, and leading to the pilled-up cache that caused corruption. </p>
<p> Whatever the reason, we have a list of solutions for you. Make sure to check them out in order to resolve the problem at hand. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check if Instagram is down </p>
<p> All active Instagram users remember major worldwide outages that occurred only a few months ago. Now, we haven’t seen outages on that scale recently, but on the other hand, server-side issues are not uncommon. </p>
<p> In order to find out the status of Instagram, you can check Instagram’s official Twitter handle, here, or navigate to DownDetector, here. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check the connection </p>
<p> The unstable connection is a common reason why Instagram won’t load and it’s especially noticeable in Instagram Direct while sending media content or messages. In order for everything to work, you’ll need to ensure a stable Wi-Fi or Mobile Data connection. </p>
<p> Slow mobile data is a no-go. And when it comes to Wireless, slow bandwidth is not a problem but rather frequent connection breaks. Instagram won’t load under those scenarios. </p>
<p> Here’s what you can do to fix possible connection issues on your device: </p>
<p> Disable and re-enable Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Restart your device and router/modem. </p>
<p> Enable Airplane mode and disable it after a minute or so. </p>
<p> Reset the Network settings. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear the Data and Cache from Instagram </p>
<p> Social media apps, especially Instagram and Facebook, tend to pile up data at enormous rates. The intention is to speed up the loading times which it does. However, once the data and cache reach a certain point, this gets counterproductive. </p>
<p> That’s why we urge you to clear your data and cache before moving to additional steps. Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from Instagram: </p>
<p> Navigate to Instagram. </p>
<p> Select Storage. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check app permissions </p>
<p> If the Feed won’t load, we can safely say that the problem isn’t in permissions. However, if you have issues with some other aspects of Instagram, like gallery access or location tags, we suggest checking the Permissions won’t hurt you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to ensure that Instagram has all necessary permissions: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps (Manage apps or Apps Manager). </p>
<p> Open Instagram from the list. </p>
<p> Choose Permissions. </p>
<p> Make sure to grant all permissions to Instagram. Now, Location is not mandatory, so if you don’t want to allow Instagram to determine your location, you don’t have to. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Leave the Instagram Beta program </p>
<p> If you enrolled in Instagram Beta and keep experiencing issues with Instagram, we suggest leaving it. Truth to be told, you won’t be getting some minor novelties before the public, but trading stability for a few nifty cosmetic features isn’t worth it. </p>
<p> Here’s how to leave Instagram Beta from the Play Store: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for Instagram. </p>
<p> Scroll down and, under the You’re a beta tester section, tap Leave. </p>
<p> Wait until you are excluded from the Beta program and update the app. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and try to log in again. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Reinstall the app </p>
<p> Finally, you can try reinstalling the app. If Instagram still won’t load after that, make sure to report the problem, here. But, before reporting the problem, let’s reinstall the app and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to reinstall Instagram on Android: </p>
<p> Open the Play Store and look for Instagram. </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and go back to the Play Store. </p>
<p> Install Instagram again. </p>
<p> If you are still unable to access it, consider temporarily switching to the web-based Instagram client, here. </p>
<p> That’s a wrap. Thanks for reading and if Instagram won’t load after you took the aforementioned steps, give us a shout out in the comments section below. We might have some other ways to tackle the problem. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/fix-iphone-wont-make-calls" parent_folder="web1" id="file17843955" filename="fix-iphone-wont-make-calls">
<p> Fix: iPhone won’t make calls </p>
<p> Even though a cellular phone got to be much more than a simple device used for calls, this is still an essential feature. And the inability to make or take calls is a debilitating problem for every user. That’s what seems to be the case for some iPhone users. </p>
<p> If the hardware isn’t the problem, then some of the steps we enlisted below should help you work it out. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Turn Airplane mode On and then Off </p>
<p> There’s only so many things which can provoke such a serious issue. But, don’t worry, the list of troubleshooting steps is short and simple. Hopefully, helpful, too. Let’s start with the simplest one, and that’s turning Airplane mode on and then off. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Toggle Airplane mode on. </p>
<p> Wait for some time and turn it off. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Disable the “Do not disturb” mode </p>
<p> You don’t have to completely disable it, you might as well tweak the settings to allow receiving phone calls. However, for the sake of troubleshooting, we suggest disabling it and looking for changes. </p>
<p> Here’s how to disable the “Do not disturb” mode on an iPhone: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Toggle the “Do not disturb” mode off. </p>
<p> Try making a call. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Make sure you haven’t blocked the caller </p>
<p> Another possible reason why the incoming calls are not coming through is a blocked caller ID. You’ve might’ve blocked the caller by accident and thus, all incoming calls from that caller’s ID will fail. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to check whether that’s the case: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Phone. </p>
<p> Choose Call blocking & identification. </p>
<p> Confirm that the call receiver’s ID isn’t blocked. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinsert SIM card </p>
<p> Reinserting the SIM card might help as well. The SIM card should be staying firm in the compartment at all times. However, it won’t cost you a thing to remove it carefully from the compartment and insert it again. We suggest powering off your device before doing so. </p>
<p> After that, the problem should be gone. Check the network reception to confirm that the SIM card is placed properly. On the other hand, if the issue is persistent, continue with the steps below. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reset network settings </p>
<p> Another viable step is to reset all network settings and configure them from the scratch. This action will delete all saved networks credentials, but it can also help you address network-related bugs on an iPhone. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reset network settings to default values: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open General. </p>
<p> Select Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> And the final option you can try before contacting your carrier or eventually the authorized service is to reset your handset to factory values. This might be a drag, but it should tackle the issue. In addition, you can restore your data later on from iCloud or by using the iTunes client. </p>
<p> Open General. </p>
<p> Select Reset. </p>
<p> After the device resets, restore everything from iCloud. </p>
<p> With that said, we can wrap it up. In case you’re still experiencing reception problems or unable to take or make calls on an iPhone, we suggest contacting your carrier. Also, make sure to tell us whether you’ve solved the problem in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: LG G4 unable to boot </p>
<p> The G series has been a breakthrough for LG. The market was heavily dominated by Samsung that was an impregnable force in the flagships department. But, the second Korean manufacturer swiftly moved in with the great design, remarkable hardware and some amazing and distinctive features. </p>
<p> Even though the G4 is exactly 2 years old since it was introduced in April 2015, it’s still an amazing device. If you’re not into software upgrades (or downgrades), LG G4 is still much better than all mid-budget devices out there. But, even the best devices are closely followed with a few issues. And the G4 isn’t an exception. Today, we are presenting you one major problem that shattered the positive image of this awesome device. Namely, we are talking about the boot loop problem. If you had this issue or similar boot difficulties, make sure to check the explanation and solution below. </p>
<p> LG G4: Boot Issues and Solution! </p>
<p> First, let’s split this ominous problem into two categories. The first category is hardware-related and LG acknowledged it. Namely, it seems that the certain device components lost contact and that resulted in a never-ending boot loop. LG provided support and offered to repair troubled handsets. So, your first step should be contacting the company </p>
<p> The other category is software-related and it seems that it started after certain firmware updates. Various users encountered different issues and, after they used recovery mode, the phone was unable to start in standard mode. Instead, the everlasting loop of restarts in recovery mode continued to eternity and beyond. However, if it’s software, then it can be solved. One way or another. And this is how. </p>
<p> Before we start, make sure that your battery is full and that you have functional PC. Additionally, install LG PC Suite that can be found here and LG Flash Tool that’s found here. And, finally, download the stock firmware for your LG G4 here (KDZ files). </p>
<p> Download and install LG PC Suite in order to connect your LG G4 with the PC. Without the proper drivers, your PC won’t be able to access the device. </p>
<p> Now, download the KDZ stock firmware file and save it on your PC. The KDZ file should go by the same name as your mobile. </p>
<p> Extract archive LG Flash Tool 2014 and run the LGFlashTool2014 application. </p>
<p> Connect your LG G4 with the computer by using the USB cable. </p>
<p> Once the program reads your LG G4, Select the KDZ file and click on CSE Flash. </p>
<p> Have in mind that this will completely wipe out your data. </p>
<p> The process should be finished in no more than 20 minutes. </p>
<p> After the phone completes the installation of stock firmware, you should resolve that pesky boot loop issue. </p>
<p> That should do it. If you have any questions or suggestions, please be free to tell us in the comments. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/fix-photos-stuck-uploading-icloud-ios" parent_folder="web1" id="file17840849" filename="fix-photos-stuck-uploading-icloud-ios">
<p> Fix: Photos stuck uploading to iCloud on iOS </p>
<p> iCloud is an essential part of iOS and a must-have backup and sync service for iPhone and iPad users. Just like the rest of iOS features, iCloud is well-designed, simplistic, user-friendly, and it does its job flawlessly. At least, most of the time. </p>
<p> Namely, some users reported a stall within iCloud Photo Library. They were unable to update recent photos or videos for no apparent reason. In order to help you, we enlisted a few trusted workarounds. If you have had alike or similar issues, make sure to check them out below. </p>
<p> Restart your device </p>
<p> In this and similar scenarios, it’s quite obvious to go for the restart. Even though iOS and iOS-powered devices are celebrated for overall stability in regard to pre-installed features, occasionally something goes wrong. So, the first step to take is to follow the instructions below and restart your device. After that, maybe the uploading deadlock ends. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button. </p>
<p> After it appears, use the slider to turn your device Off. </p>
<p> After the device turns off, use the Sleep/Wake button to turn it ON again. </p>
<p> Disable Low Power Mode </p>
<p> Perhaps the most common cause of this issue is having the Low Power Mode. As you can tell, this feature disables some more power-consuming features in order to save the battery when the percentage is low. When this feature is on, Photos won’t upload to iCloud. </p>
<p> Since the phone automatically disables this feature once the battery is fully charged, basically all you need to do is charge your iPhone. But you can also manually disable it, and the photo sync will continue. To disable Low Power Mode, go to Settings > Battery, and disable Low Power Mode. </p>
<p> You can also put Low Power Mode in the Control Center for even easier access. To do so, head over to Settings > Control Centre > Customise Controls, and choose Low Power Mode. </p>
<p> Make sure you’re properly connected to the internet </p>
<p> Obviously, if you’re not properly connected to the internet, Photos will briefly stop uploading to iCloud. So, before proceeding to other solutions, make sure to check your internet connection. </p>
<p> We’re talking about WiFi, of course, because Photos will only upload to iCloud when you’re connected to a WiFi network. On the other hand, if you want to upload photos using mobile data, you can enable this option too. However, it’s not recommended, since uploading photos will eat up huge amounts of data. </p>
<p> If you don’t mind that, here’s how to enable photo upload via mobile data: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Photos. </p>
<p> Tap Mobile Data, and enable Mobile Data. </p>
<p> Disable and re-enable iCloud Photo Library </p>
<p> If just a simple restart isn’t sufficient to address the issue at hand, you can always apply the same medicine to update-related features. Namely, you should navigate to iCloud and disable the iCloud Photo Library which is a cloud storage part dedicated to photos. After that, you can re-enable it and look for changes. </p>
<p> If you’re uncertain how to do it, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Open iCloud. </p>
<p> Tap Photos. </p>
<p> Follow the same path and re-enable iCloud Photo Library. </p>
<p> If even that fell short and your photos just won’t upload to iCloud Photo Library, there are additional steps you should take into consideration. </p>
<p> Delete all backed up photos </p>
<p> This procedure is screaming ”time-consuming annoyance!” but it is as it is. You’re stuck with your iCloud misbehaving like an obnoxious child and previous steps are, obviously, underwhelming. However, don’t worry, your Camera Roll photos are not endangered. We only need to clear photos and videos stored on iCloud. If you ask yourself ”why?”, the answer is simple: due to corrupted photo or video, all others suffer. One rotten apple (pun not intended) and everything suddenly goes south. </p>
<p> Make sure that all photos you need are either on phone storage or safely backed up on PC or Mac. </p>
<p> Open iCloud. </p>
<p> Tap Photos. </p>
<p> Use your computer to access iCloud and delete all photos and videos. </p>
<p> Re-enable iCloud Photo Library. </p>
<p> All photos from your device storage should start uploading and everything should be resolved. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if you’re still stuck in the iCloud’s purgatory, you still have one last resort. Yes, it’s the factory reset. If the problem somehow surpassed reinitialization, the hard reset should be the right tool for the job. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to perform a factory reset: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Choose General. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Select Erase All Content and Settings. </p>
<p> This will erase all of your data, so be sure to back it up before performing the reset. </p>
<p> Confirm the selection and start the process. </p>
<p> Later on, you should choose Restore from the iCloud Backup feature, and retrieve your data. </p>
<p> In addition, it might be more convenient to run with iTunes: </p>
<p> Download and install the latest version of iTunes app on your PC. </p>
<p> Start iTunes and choose Summary. </p>
<p> Remember to backup your iPhone data. </p>
<p> Select Restore iPhone. </p>
<p> That should be it. Don’t forget to share your questions or alternative solutions with us and other readers in the comments section below. We’ll appreciate it. Thanks for reading. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/fix-problem-loading-widget-error-on-android" parent_folder="web1" id="file17843830" filename="fix-problem-loading-widget-error-on-android">
<p> Fix: Problem Loading Widget error on Android </p>
<p> Using Home Screen widgets is as old as Android itself. Many users still employ nifty widgets for a whole lot of different uses, most of all aesthetics. However, there seem to be more than a few reports about the Problem Loading Widget error on Android. </p>
<p> If you are bothered by this error, make sure to check our solutions below. </p>
<p> How to fix Problem Loading Widget error for good </p>
<p> There are various causes for the Problem Loading Widget error. The most common one is a temporary halt which is simply resolved by a reboot or re-adding the widget. </p>
<p> However, corrupt app’s cache or lack of permissions for custom launchers might cause it as well. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Remove the widget and add it again </p>
<p> This one is simple. First, reboot your device and check whether the Problem Loading Widget error reoccurs. If the problem persists, we recommend just a simple tap, hold, and drag towards the top of the Home Screen where you can remove the widget. </p>
<p> The only remaining thing to do is add it again, so here’s how to do it with ease: </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the empty area of the Home Screen to access the Launcher settings. </p>
<p> Choose Widgets. </p>
<p> Tap, hold and drag the widget you want to place on your Home Screen wherever you want it to be. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Make sure that custom launcher has enough permissions </p>
<p> Now, the system launcher, the default one, has all permissions to load various widgets and keep them on your Home Screen. That’s not the case for third-party custom launchers like Nova Launcher, Microsoft Launcher, or Action Launcher. </p>
<p> With that in mind, restart your custom launcher and try adding widgets. If that fails and you see the error again, then check its permissions. To ensure that a custom launcher can create widgets, first backup the launcher settings. Then reset it. </p>
<p> After that, just remove the widget and try adding it again. You should be prompted with a question about granting permission to create widgets. Accept it and the error won’t appear anymore. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear apps cache and data </p>
<p> Widgets are, as we all know, part of apps. In apps, you can configure and make changes to widgets. Especially in apps that are basically handling solely widgets. </p>
<p> And each and every app store cache and data locally, and cached files tend to corrupt or break apps after some time. Therefore, in order to ensure that the main app to which widget belongs is not the cause of the problem, we should clear its cache and data. </p>
<p> But, before doing so, we recommend moving all apps that carry widgets you use regularly to local storage. Most of the time, they won’t work as intended while being installed on the SD card. </p>
<p> Once you’ve done that, here’s how to clear cache and data from an app on Android: </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Select Manage apps, App Manager, or All apps. </p>
<p> Open your launcher from the list of apps. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data. This will make the built-in launcher default again. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and set your custom launcher as the default launcher. </p>
<p> Try adding widgets again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall the app </p>
<p> In case the previous step hasn’t solved the Problem Loading Widget error, make sure to reinstall the app. Whatever the problem is, reinstalling the app usually resolves it. </p>
<p> After you reinstall the app, make sure to grant it necessary permissions (allowing it to work in the background is essential) and try and create another widget. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Make sure your system is up to date </p>
<p> Finally, just make sure that your system is up to date. Issues with widgets might occur because an app is already optimized for a newer version of Android. Rarely, though, but it’s still the case. </p>
<p> That’s a wrap. Thank you for reading and we hope this guide helped you address the widget problem at hand. In addition, don’t forget to share alternative solutions with us or post a question concerning the ones we listed. The comments section is just below. </p>

<p> Fix: Uber crashes and freezes on iPhone </p>
<p> Uber and other online car on-demand services are ever growing niche. And Uber is, at the moment at least, the leading taxi service in multiple countries around the world. It’s fast and reliable, just as the app that makes it functional service in the first place. Too bad it invades your privacy, though. </p>
<p> However, iOS users have experienced issues with the Uber app, including the frequent freezing that, later on, leads to crashes and renders the complete service unusable. Moreover, it affects both parts: customers and drivers themselves. As you would expect, this is a grave problem for this service. So, today, we’ll try and address it with a few viable workarounds. </p>
<p> So, if you’ve experienced crashes with the Uber app in iOS, make sure to check the solutions below. </p>
<p> Restart your device and app </p>
<p> The first obvious viable solution is to restart the device. Namely, your OS can, because of various reasons, cause app freezing or crashing. Just like so many other apps, the Uber app, can either suffer from accumulated cache or other system-related problems. For that purpose, make sure to restart your handset and give Uber another try later on. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button. </p>
<p> After it appears, use the slider to turn your device Off. </p>
<p> After the device turns off, use Sleep/Wake button to turn it ON again. </p>
<p> Force quit the app and try again </p>
<p> If the Uber app is the instigator of the issue at hand rather than all-around system performance, you can force quit the app and start it again. This should resolve in-app stall and resolve freezing that leads to crashes. As same as the above-mentioned solution, this is easy to do and an elementary step in the troubleshooting procedure. </p>
<p> Double tap the home button. </p>
<p> Swipe up on the Uber app card. </p>
<p> Reopen the app. </p>
<p> That should relieve you of the problem and you should resolve the issue. However, if the problem is of more deeper nature, you might need to check the alternative solutions below. </p>
<p> Check the connection </p>
<p> Another known reason for crashes/freezing of the Uber app on iOS is related to the connection. As you’re well aware, this app can’t function without the proper connection. So make sure to check the connection before we move to other steps. There’s a chance that you’ll need to rely on mobile data instead of Wi-Fi, so it’s of utmost importance to check both mobile data and Wi-Fi connectivity in order to retain stable connection. Only that way you can be sure that everything functions as intended. </p>
<p> In Cellular Data > Use Cellular Data For, check that Uber app is enabled. </p>
<p> Switch between 3G and 4G to find which works better. </p>
<p> Update iOS </p>
<p> Many users experienced issues with Uber app after upgrading to iOS 10. Luckily, additional updates changed the things for the better. So, for that purpose, it’s highly advised to check for available updates and, hopefully, we’ll get in the clear. However, things tend to get complicated for some users. Certain apps might not be timely updated in regard to active iOS version, so for some users, it’s better not to update iOS until the corresponding app update emerges. </p>
<p> To update your iOS to the latest version, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Check if the latest Uber app version supports latest iOS. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Choose Software Update. </p>
<p> Install the update. </p>
<p> Update/reinstall the app </p>
<p> When it comes to standard app troubleshooting of iOS apps, there’s only so much you can do. Most of the time, they function good and are well optimized in comparison to certain Android apps. Of course, if your iPhone isn’t jailbroken. What you can do, and that’s quite often just enough, is to update or reinstall the troubled app and hope for the best. </p>
<p> To update the Uber app, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Tap App Store. </p>
<p> Open Updates. </p>
<p> If there are updates available for Uber, tap to update it. </p>
<p> On the app screen, tap and hold the Uber app until the X appears. </p>
<p> Tap X to uninstall the app. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Open App Store and search for Uber. </p>
<p> Tap and install the app. </p>
<p> That should do it. After those, your problems should be gone and you can continue to use your favorite taxi service both as a partner-driver or customer. For additional questions or alternative solutions, there’s a comment section below. Make sure to tell us about your experience and we’ll be glad to help. Thank you for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Fix: Unable to download Android apps from the Play Store </p>
<p> As we all know, the greatest advantage of the Android OS is an extreme quantity and diversity of downloadable apps and games. You can choose from as many as 2,2 million apps and enhance your experience with the favorite handheld device or just satisfy curiosity in spare time. </p>
<p> But, what happens when the download won’t start or won’t finish, after it starts? Well, don’t despair, my friend, because there’s always a solution. As the matter of fact, we have a few possible workarounds for you. </p>
<p> What to do if you’re unable to download apps from the Play Store </p>
<p> Make sure you are connected to stable internet connection or mobile data network </p>
<p> Always check connection before anything else. It is the simplest of problems but it occurs quite often. </p>
<p> For start, reset your phone and wireless router. </p>
<p> Check date and time settings because Play Store goes crazy if they are set wrong </p>
<p> In ”Date and time” part of Settings, uncheck ”Automatic date and time” and ”Automatic time zone’, then set current time and date. </p>
<p> After that go back and check ”Automatic date and time” and ”Automatic time zone” boxes. </p>
<p> No, it’s just a phone, not a time travel machine, so be on point with your settings, Phineas. </p>
<p> Clear Play Store apps cache memory and data </p>
<p> Cache is a devils lair of any android driven phone so once in a while you need to bleach it. </p>
<p> Go to the ”Apps” or ”Application manager”, and in a Google Play Store app clear cache and data. </p>
<p> Be aware that this will erase your saved password and settings in Play Store so you will need to set them up again. </p>
<p> Once in a while your overwhelmed Play Store may need reinstalling </p>
<p> In ”Apps” or ”Application manager” find Google Play Store and uninstall updates. This will take it back to factory settings. </p>
<p> After that, once you start it, it will update to the latest version. </p>
<p> Reborn like a phoenix from the ashes of past self, it should work much faster and reliable. </p>
<p> Install updates to your Android OS </p>
<p> System updates are mostly automatic but it won’t hurt you to check for available updates once in a while. </p>
<p> In Settings>About find and install any available updates. They will improve your device stability and give your app downloading problem a swift solution. </p>
<p> Last but not least: Storage space and how come I made my 16gb SD card look so insufficient? </p>
<p> Probably the most reliable solution for this problem is to clear some data from your internal or external storage respectively. </p>
<p> Large apps and apps with lots of background work will slow your phone down and take a lot of space. </p>
<p> Also, any other data like 2000 selfies from your living room or 345 of HD videos of your cat talking Klingon is crippling to your storage. </p>
<p> Make sure you try every of the steps and we hope your problem is solved. There are plenty new apps trending and all of them are waiting for you. </p>
<p> If you tried all of the 6 steps and still have a problem, be sure to write about it in the comment section. We will do our best to make it work. </p>

<p> Fix: Unable to update to iOS 12 </p>
<p> Even though lots of folks are not keen on updating after the whole throttling fiasco, iOS 12 is, performance-wise at least, one great upgrade for all eligible devices. That’s why some users were surprised that the iOS 12 update won’t apply. They were unable to update to iOS 12 after multiple tries. </p>
<p> Don’t worry, we have a few solutions to this problem. Therefore, if you’re stuck with iOS 11 and care to get the latest iteration, make sure to check them out. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check the connection </p>
<p> Firstly, the list of the eligible devices for iOS 12 in the photo below. </p>
<p> Let’s start with the connection checkup. If you the wireless network you use is unstable, chances are that the contact with the dedicated server will fail. That’s why we suggest troubleshooting the network. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Reset your router and handset. </p>
<p> Temporarily disconnect all other devices on the same network. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. Go to Settings > tap General > tap Reset, and reset network and internet settings. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the connection isn’t the problem, we suggest moving to additional steps. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Make sure you have enough storage space </p>
<p> Storage space, or lack of it to be on point, is another possible reason for the update fail. Albeit, the update process will put aside some temporary app files, it still needs 1GB or more storage space in order to download all necessary files. </p>
<p> For that reason, we suggest backing up everything you can on the iCloud (or any other online storage) or PC, and clearing the data from the local storage. That way, you’ll make enough space for the iOS 12 installation file. </p>
<p> After the installation ends and your handset boots, the installation file will be deleted so you’ll have your old storage space back. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – The downloaded update file isn’t complete </p>
<p> This might be another reason why you’re unable to update to iOS 12. Namely, if you’ve already started the update process and the file isn’t properly downloaded (not in its entirety or corrupted), and thus the installation won’t start. This means that you’re stuck in the dead end. A new installation file can’t be downloaded and the current one is of no use whatsoever. </p>
<p> That’s why you’ll need to delete it and restart the update procedure in order to get a new file. Once there, updating won’t be an issue anymore. </p>
<p> Have in mind that the dedicated update server might be down temporarily. If an error pops-up, wait for some time and try again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Update your device with iTunes </p>
<p> If you’re still unable to get iOS 12 via the Over-the-Air update sequence, there’s an alternative. You can circumvent all previous steps by simply connecting your iPhone/iPad to a Mac/PC and use the iTunes client to apply updates. </p>
<p> You can use ethernet to speed up the download process, and you can even use your PC/Mac to backup all data from the handset. In addition, we suggest a clean install. Installing a major update on a clean slate device with factory values is always the best way to avoid possible issues. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to update your iPhone/iPad to iOS 12 via iTunes: </p>
<p> Install the latest version of the iTunes app on your PC. </p>
<p> Remember to backup your iPhone data. </p>
<p> Skip restoring the backup and update to iOS 12. </p>
<p> That’s a wrap. Thanks for reading and hopefully we helped you address the problem. If you have any alternative ways to sort this out or possibly a question or two, the comments section is just below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/fix-whatsapp-calls-not-working-in-android" parent_folder="web1" id="file17843122" filename="fix-whatsapp-calls-not-working-in-android">
<p> Fix: WhatsApp calls not working in Android </p>
<p> WhatsApp started as an instant messenger and nowadays is so much more. The ”Swiss knife” of communication, this Facebook-owned app has more than 1.6 billion users. While the initial idea behind it was messaging, this app allows users to make VoIP phone calls. And that’s the subject of this article, as some users are unable to make calls with WhatsApp on Android. </p>
<p> We made sure to enlist some possible solutions, but bear in mind that the connection is the most common problem. Make sure you don’t have a metered network or some other kinds of limitations. Either way, check up the list and hopefully we’ll get you into clear. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear apps cache </p>
<p> Let’s start with the simplest of solutions. If the problem is of local nature, the best thing you can do to address is reset the app’s cache. Every app stores it in order to keep some configuration data locally for a more seamless use. However, once it piles up, it might cause some issues with the app. </p>
<p> And that’s why you should clear the cache and look for improvements. If you’re not sure how to do it, check the instructions below: </p>
<p> Open Apps. </p>
<p> Choose WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Re-establish the account </p>
<p> Another possible reason why you can’t make calls with WhatsApp might lie in the profile configuration. As you already know, the WhatsApp account is attached to your phone number, and thus any switches might lead to an issue, especially on the dual-SIM handsets. That’s why we suggest removing your account and re-establishing it. The procedure is rather fast, and it just might be the solutions for your problem. </p>
<p> Here’s how to remove and re-establish a WhatsApp account: </p>
<p> Open WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Open the 3-dot menu and choose Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Account. </p>
<p> Now, restart your device and make sure the SIM-card you want to use is active. </p>
<p> Open WhatsApp and enter your phone number. </p>
<p> Activate the account with the confirmation code. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Make sure WhatsApp has all permissions enabled </p>
<p> In order to make calls, WhatsApp needs your permission. Making sure that the required permission is granted is your next step. Of course, Camera permission doesn’t have much in common with the problem we’re trying to address today. However, for the sake of troubleshooting, we suggest granting all permissions to WhatsApp. </p>
<p> If you’re not sure where to check permissions, here’s the instruction: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Apps & notifications. </p>
<p> Choose WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Select Permissions. </p>
<p> Enable all permissions and try making a call again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check the connection </p>
<p> This is, far and beyond, the most probable reason why you’re not able to make a call on WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Duo, or any other VoIP app in your hands. If there’s a chance to do a test on an alternative network, do so right away. Switching to mobile data instead of Wi-Fi or vice versa should do the trick. Now, if the problem is persistent, we suggest moving to the final step. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the other network works as intended but you’re not able to make calls on your own, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Restart your phone and wireless router. </p>
<p> Delete the Wi-Fi network from your device and connect again. </p>
<p> Make sure Mobile Data is not disabled on WhatsApp’s App Data Usage. </p>
<p> Reset your router to factory values. </p>
<p> Reset phone’s Network settings. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reinstall the app </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps worked for you, the only reasonable solution we can suggest is the reinstallation. But, before you start from a scratch, try and update the app. If the problem is in the app, there will be a patch for it. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. In case you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to tell us in the comments section. Thanks for reading. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/fix-whatsapp-on-android-receives-files-but-wont-send-them" parent_folder="web1" id="file17847782" filename="fix-whatsapp-on-android-receives-files-but-wont-send-them">
<p> Fix: WhatsApp on Android receives files, but won’t send them </p>
<p> Almost every instant messenger allows users to, besides the text messages, exchange photos, videos, and every imaginable file in form of an attachment. Besides privacy and group chats, this is the biggest selling point today. Sadly, even the most-used IM, WhatsApp, has some issues with sending files occasionally. </p>
<p> The affected users said that they’re receiving files just fine, but can’t send them. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Allow WhatsApp to access the SD card </p>
<p> The most common reason why you’re unable to send photos is caused by the WhatsApp’s inability to access the external storage. If your photos are stored on the SD card, chances are you won’t be able to send them via WhatsApp. </p>
<p> That’s why you need to allow the WhatsApp app to access the external storage. Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Open Apps. </p>
<p> Select WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Choose Permissions. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear data from WhatsApp </p>
<p> The WhatsApp saves everything locally, including the chat history, recordings, and photos. These tend to pile up, and quickly so, which can slow down the app’s performance. Or, and which is more important in this case, even prevent some of the key features from working. </p>
<p> That’s probably the good reason to clear all data. Just don’t forget to backup all WhatsApp photos, as this procedure will likely relieve you of all received files. </p>
<p> Open Apps. </p>
<p> Choose WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reinstall WhatsApp or try an older version </p>
<p> Also, you can try reinstalling the app or even install some older iteration of WhatsApp. This way, if there’s some bug at hand plaguing the current version, it won’t harass you anymore. </p>
<p> Reinstallation should, preferably, be clean without loading any backups from Google Drive. Of course, later on, you won’t be able to restore your messages. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reinstall WhatsApp cleanly: </p>
<p> Uninstall WhatsApp by dragging it to the top in the App Drawer. </p>
<p> (Optionally) Open Google Drive > hamburger menu > Backups. Delete WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Open Play Store and download WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Sign in with your number and confirm the code. </p>
<p> Try sending files. </p>
<p> APK installation is an even better troubleshooting step, especially since the frequent updates tend to break this instant messenger for various Android devices. </p>
<p> And these steps should show you how to install an older APK version of WhatsApp: </p>
<p> Uninstall WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced settings > Security, and Enable installation of non-official apps. </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror and download one of the older WhatsApp versions. Avoid Beta versions. </p>
<p> Install the APK and restart your device. </p>
<p> Try sending the files again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check the connection and storage </p>
<p> Now, let’s take some time to inspect two important segments which are essential for WhatsApp performance. The first one is the network. If you use mobile data to send photos, recordings, or attachments, make sure that the Mobile Data is allowed. </p>
<p> If the upload speed is lackluster, the app will automatically prevent updates. For that reason, try restarting your device and router and, if issues still follow, reset Network settings. </p>
<p> Here’s where to look for Mobile data WhatsApp settings: </p>
<p> Tap Apps. </p>
<p> Open WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Tap Data usage. </p>
<p> The second important thing to check is the storage memory. Since WhatsApp saves all in-app interactions locally, you need to have at least some spare space in order to use it in a seamless manner. </p>
<p> If you’re dangerously low on storage space, make sure to clear some files. Backing up photos to Google Photos or removing the cache for apps should give you some extra space. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Format SD card </p>
<p> Finally, if you have enough internal storage space, you can choose to store all new photos to local storage. Just open Camera and select Device as a preferred storage. On the other hand, if you need to use the SD card but WhatsApp can’t access it and send files, we recommend formatting it. </p>
<p> Of course, you’ll need to backup all your files, preferably on a PC. After that, you can safely format your SD card while in phone or with the PC. Once you’ve dealt with it, both WhatsApp and other third-party apps should have an easier time accessing the content on an SD card. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Memory & storage (Storage). </p>
<p> Open SD card. </p>
<p> That’s should do it. Hopefully, after these steps, you’ll be able to send files via WhatsApp without any issues. Additionally, we strongly encourage you to tell us if the issue is gone in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: WiFi connection doesn’t work on my Android device </p>
<p> We tend to use the internet more on our smartphones than we do on our computers, that’s a fact. We use our phones for browsing the web, watching YouTube videos, chatting, updating our social profiles, and more. </p>
<p> However, one of the most common problems every Android user faces is the problem with the WiFi connection. There’s nothing more annoying than your WiFi stopping working when you need it, but unfortunately, that happens from time to time. </p>
<p> So in this article, we’re going to explore what can cause the WiFi connection to stop working on your Android device, and what are the possible ways to solve this serious issue. </p>
<p> How to solve WiFi connection problems on Android </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Reconnect to a WiFi network </p>
<p> As banal as it might sound, simply reconnecting to your current WiFi network can get the problem solved. There are various factors that can break the connection between your phone and the WiFi network, and the solution in most cases is to simply re-establish the connection. </p>
<p> So, go to WiFi settings on your Android phone, disconnect from the network you’re currently connected to, and connect again. If our theory was correct, everything should work fine this time, if not, try some of the solutions listed below. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check your router settings </p>
<p> In some occasions, the problem can occur because of your Wi-Fi router. If multiple devices are connected to the same wireless network, that can cause conflict and lead on to unstable connection. Additionally, you can tweak router settings. </p>
<p> Firstly, hook up your PC and router with LAN cable. Every internet provider has a specific way of entering router settings so you can inform before you start. Once you are logged in, take a good look at WLAN tab and make sure that it is enabled. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Make sure you’re using a 2.4 GHz band </p>
<p> There are 2 main frequency bands used on Android Wi-Fi: 2.4 GHz or 5Ghz. The one you want to setup is 2.4 GHz because it has slower but longer range and will suit you better. To do so, follow the instructions: </p>
<p> Tap three dots icon. </p>
<p> Choose Advanced. </p>
<p> This should repair broken connection and eventually secure stable one. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Turn off Data Connection and Bluetooth </p>
<p> Data Connection or Bluetooth can interfere with the wireless. While they are useful at specified occasions, you should turn them off while using wireless. This goes in both directions, so if you are transferring data via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi should be disabled. </p>
<p> By disabling them, your device should connect with ease to the desired network. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Turn off WiFi optimization </p>
<p> Wi-Fi Optimization is an option implemented in Android device with the task to optimize Wi-Fi usage in order to prolong battery life. Hefty usage of Wi-Fi will work against battery life but this option can suppress connection or make it unstable with certain apps. Our advice is to disable it. To do so, follow the instructions: </p>
<p> Tap three dots icon. </p>
<p> Choose Advanced. </p>
<p> Maybe it will hit your battery for few percentages, but the connection will work better. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Make sure WiFi module is working </p>
<p> The question that always rests at the end is the possible hardware malfunction. The Wi-Fi module may be a defect and the reason why you are unable to connect to a network. Try out different routers and restore the phone to factory settings. If the problem persists, be sure to take your phone for a diagnose and repair in trusted hands. </p>
<p> We wouldn’t advise you to try repairing it by yourself since you can lose your warranty and make it worse. </p>
<p> We hope that this was helpful and that you ‘ll manage to use your Wi-Fi again in no time. If you are heaving any other solutions for the problem, be sure to tell us about it in the comment section. </p>
<p> 1 COMMENT </p>
<p> Hello, I followed your instructions in solution 3 to a point then, their was no 2.4 band with button to find. Solution 5 followed your instructions to find their was no wi fi optimization spot. Why is this? Thank you </p>

<p> Most common Fortnite issues in iOS and how to fix them </p>
<p> Fortnite is more than just a game. It’s a culture. We haven’t had a game that’s so impactful on people’s lives in a long time. People play Fortnite, people talk Fortnite, people dance Fortnite, and so on. </p>
<p> Fortnite is also one of those games that leave no one indifferent. You either love it or hate it. But let’s not forget that, despite its cultural status, Fortnite is still just a game. It’s made of code and runs on your computer/mobile phone. And when something’s made of code and requires a certain platform to run, technical issues happen. </p>
<p> That’s why I conducted the list of the most common Fortnite problems in iOS. So, if even one of these issues prevents you from enjoying Fortnite with your friends or complete strangers, I hope you’ll find a solution here. </p>
<p> 1. Fortnite crashes in iOS </p>
<p> Crashing is perhaps the most common problem with just about any game, and Fortnite is not an exception. Not many things are more annoying than a game that crashes on the loading screen, or god forbid, in the midst of a battle. </p>
<p> Since you’re playing the game on your iPhone or iPad, the troubleshooting options are more limited compared to PC. But that also means there are fewer factors that could cause the game to crash. It usually comes down to stacked cache data, a bug caused by a certain update or the background refresh service. And these are exactly our troubleshooting options for the Fortnite crashing problem in iOS. </p>
<p> 1. Update the game </p>
<p> As a popular game with millions of users, Fortnite receives updates frequently. Frequent updates increase the chance of the occurrence of some bug inside the code that will cause the game to crash. But with the ongoing development and a thriving community, the patch will likely arrive sooner rather than later. </p>
<p> So, just make sure the game is up to date, and the crashing problem should eventually case to exist. </p>
<p> 2. Reinstall the game </p>
<p> Stacked up cache data can also cause the crashing problem, especially if you’re low on storage. Unfortunately, iOS doesn’t allow you to just go to settings and clear the cache and data, as Android does. </p>
<p> So, you’ll have to completely uninstall the game to clear the cache and data. After that, just head to the App Store and install Fortnite once again. I know, it’s a hassle, but it could be worth the effort if the crashes vanish after reinstalling. </p>
<p> 3. Disable background refresh </p>
<p> According to some users, iOS’ background refresh feature causes Fortnite to crash for some reason. So, disable this feature, and see if the crashes still persist. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General > Background refresh. </p>
<p> Turn Background refresh off. </p>
<p> Now, open Fortnite. </p>
<p> Go to the settings menu and check if the background refresh option is off. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> 2. Fortnite stuck on Loading Screen in iOS </p>
<p> Having your game stuck on the loading screen is equally annoying as crashing. In fact, it’s almost the same type of problem. That’s why we can apply the same principle to resolving this issue as we did with crashing. </p>
<p> Moreover, this issue is likely caused by a faulty update. So, try the same workarounds as for the crashing: check for new updates, reinstall the game and disable the background refresh service. On top of that, try closing some apps running in the background, as there might not be enough available memory for Fortnite to start. </p>
<p> 3. Fortnite unable to connect to servers in iOS </p>
<p> There are three reasons you may not be able to connect to Fortnite servers. The servers are down, you’re facing some network connection issue, or your account is blocked. </p>
<p> You can easily check the Fortnite server status on this link. If the server is down, you obviously won’t be able to connect. But don’t worry, no outage should last for too long, and the connection problem should be resolved relatively soon. </p>
<p> In case you’re not able to properly connect to the internet, try resetting your Network settings, or check this article for more solutions. </p>
<p> Epic Games now bans users who access the servers using VPN. So, if you recently used a VPN or committed some other ‘crime’, there’s nothing else you can do except opening a new account. </p>
<p> 4. Fortnite voice chat issues in iOS </p>
<p> According to Epic Games, the voice chat feature tends to cause ‘stability issues’ on Android and iOS devices. That’s why the development team temporarily disables this feature from time to time. </p>
<p> Update: After enabling voice chat on iOS we’re seeing an increase in stability issues. Due to these issues we’ve decided to temporarily disable voice chat on iOS and Android devices while we continue to investigate. </p>
<p> So, in case you’re experiencing voice chat issues on your iPhone or iPad, follow Fortnite’s official Twitter account for updates. </p>
<p> 5. Fortnite sound problems in iOS </p>
<p> Many users report strange in-game sound problems. According to one user of the Fortnite forums, sound randomly cuts every time he’s in-game. The sound briefly returns when tweaked in the settings, but the pattern seems to stay. </p>
<p> As it turns out, there’s a strange connection between Fortnite and the system’s vibration feature. Namely, if your ringer is set to vibrate, you’ll encounter sound problems in Fortnite. So, if the sound problem appears, just disable vibration, and you should be good to go. </p>
<p> 6. Party failed to connect </p>
<p> If you cannot connect to the game as a Party member, try changing your DNS settings, as a few users reported that resolves the connection issue. </p>
<p> Keep in mind that iOS doesn’t allow for changing the DNS settings for the mobile connection. So, you can only change the DNS of the WiFi network you’re currently connected to. </p>
<p> I recommend one of the two most popular DNS servers, and these are Google DNS or OpenDNS. </p>
<p> GoogleDNS: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 </p>
<p> OpenDNS: 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220 </p>
<p> Here’s how to change the DNS settings in iOS: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Go to Wi-Fi and tap the blue i icon next to your current WiFi network. </p>
<p> Tap the DNS field, and enter the address of your choice (as shown above). </p>
<p> Save the changes and restart your device. </p>
<p> After changing the DNS settings, you should be able to connect as a Party member. Additionally, if one or more of your friends are playing on their iPhone/iPad devices, they might face the same issue, so make sure to share the solution with them. </p>
<p> 7. Low FPS </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing low FPS while playing Fortnite on your iPhone or iPad, try to free up some memory by closing the background apps. Disabling the Background refresh feature could also help. </p>
<p> Of course, a faulty update could also cause low FPS. If you suspect that might be the case, you can really just wait for Epic to release a patch. </p>
<p> 8. Fortnite freezes in iOS </p>
<p> The freezing problem is the same one as crashing and getting stuck on the loading screen. So, most of the time you’ll have to wait for developers to release a fixing update. On top of that, try reinstalling the game and disabling the Background refresh service (as shown above). </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope this article helped you resolve your problem with Fortnite in iOS. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, just let us know in the comments below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/full-storage-android" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844936" filename="full-storage-android">
<p> Fix: Android phone says ‘Storage is full’ even after cleaning up </p>
<p> Space organization on digital devices is a problem as old as the first data storage. And nowadays, when we become multimedia freaks, all those photos, music or apps must fit. Storing devices are getting smaller and storage space bigger and faster to read. Sometimes the phone ‘memory’ is as important as our own with all those memorabilia. And Android is just the right showcase of the phenomenon. </p>
<p> This ‘race for storage space’ can lead to a few problems. One of them can be software error that is misinforming you about full storage even though is not. Others share the same message but are actually on point. The internal storage is really out of space for new additions, and the measures have to be taken. </p>
<p> We prepared some tips for you to clear out internal space or even expand it. </p>
<p> Use Cloud or PC storage to relief some data </p>
<p> First and foremost, online storages are your best bet to easily put away your data and reach for it whenever is needed. Additionally, it is the safest option. You may lose or break your phone or corrupt SD data. With the files uploaded, you may stay sure they will be there next day: safe and accessible. Android implements Google Photos wich offers unlimited photo storage. For other files types, you can choose between Dropbox, One Drive, Google Drive, MEGA and many others. </p>
<p> A viable option is moving data to a PC. True, you won’t be able to access it on the move, but remember, that will give you more space for new data. And there are so many new scenes just waiting to be photographed. </p>
<p> Inspect your storage for the ‘heaviest’ files </p>
<p> Android phones have built-in Storage tool that will give you an insight of what is exactly taking all that space on your storage. It is good enough for the classic clean up of the drive but won’t show all the details. There are leftovers of uninstalled apps and unnecessary or duplicated files. That is a job for third-party apps. </p>
<p> Since there is a lot of free apps, you can choose for yourself. We are using SD Maid and find it to be a brilliant solution. With user-friendly interface and a lot of valuable options, you can clean up your storage in no time. </p>
<p> Use your SD card as internal storage </p>
<p> For the beginning, the lack of internal storage can’t be replaced with SD card expansion. Sure, you can put all of your music, videos, and photos on the SD card. However, the apps aren’t functioning that way. Even if you choose to install the app on external storage, the parts of the app will be stored on the internal one. Or, rather, try to move an already installed app from the phone to SD? Nope. It will save you up some space, but you’ll still have the traces of the app in internal phone memory. Apps run trough the internal storage and that’s it. </p>
<p> But what if you can make your phone read your SD card as an internal storage? After the Android 6.0 Marshmallow, it is possible. Instead of using your SD card as external storage, you can format and adopt SD card like an internal memory with Android built-in support. While this will create more space for your apps, it has a few drawbacks. First, your SD card is likely to be slower than the standard internal storage. Second, once formatted, SD card can’t be accessed from other devices. Moreover, as the system will read it as an internal rather than external memory, it shouldn’t be removed. Still, if you are down with that, grab yourself some fast SD and try it out. </p>
<p> Select Use as internal storage. </p>
<p> Remember that you can change SD back to external storage or migrate files anytime. This can be done by accessing Settings > Storage and USB > Tap the name of the card > Settings. </p>
<p> Clear apps cache </p>
<p> Have you ever been in this specific situation: </p>
<p> You download and install an app that is around 10 MB, for example. After some time, you discover by using your built-in Storage Tool, that the app is consuming 1 GB of space. Confusing, isn’t it? </p>
<p> Well, thing is, the app, its cache, and data, are all summarized in that amount. If you are, for example, using WhatsApp and sending the photos to your friends, all the photos will be stored in apps data folder. So, cleaning the cache and data once in a while can free you a lot of space. </p>
<p> Choose All. </p>
<p> Even though we placed it at the last spot, this should be your first step in freeing up some space. Additionally, most of the apps will work faster once the cache and data are cleared. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> We hope that you’ll manage to overcome your space annoyance with this tips. If you are still having the problem or, maybe, rely some different solution on your mind, do share it with us. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy A50 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy A50 is steadily climbing the ladder to the top of the mid-range segment. It appears that the phone became an instant success, as Samsung reshaped its mid-range strategy to bring an even better pack for the value. </p>
<p> Sure, the Galaxy A50 is an all-around exceptional device. But no smartphone is perfect, as some issues arise sooner or later. And this has nothing to do with the A50 being a mid-range device. After all, the Galaxy S10 has a plethora of issues, as well. It all comes down to how you use your phone. </p>
<p> So, if you recently encountered a certain problem on your Galaxy A50, chances are I’ll mention it in this article. Just find the problem you’re looking for, and I hope you’ll find the solution, as well. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Fingerprint issue </p>
<p> Although the A50 doesn’t feature an ultra-sonic fingerprint sensor, as its flagship cousin does, we can still include it in the first generation of smartphones to boast an optical in-display scanner. As much as Samsung (and all other companies) tested it before the official launch, it’s still the first generation. And the first generation of any tech isn’t the most reliable one. </p>
<p> Users notice that in everyday use. There are numerous reports of the fingerprint sensor missing the scan or not working properly. If you too have to say a few bad words about the in-display scanner, I’m sorry, but you just have to bear with it and keep in mind it’s the first generation tech that doesn’t work as intended every time. </p>
<p> Sure, Samsung promises software updates that will supposedly improve the fingerprint scanner’s responsiveness and accuracy, but whether that will indeed be the case is questionable. The only thing left for you is to keep your phone up to date and hope for the best. Changing or removing the screen protector could also be helpful, but I honestly doubt it’s the main reason for the slow fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> 2. No LED notification light </p>
<p> If you’re wondering why the LED light doesn’t blink when you receive a notification (as it probably did on your previous smartphone), it’s because the Galaxy A50 doesn’t have one. This is not a problem per se, but maybe you missed this information when researching the A50 before you bought it, so it doesn’t hurt if I mention it again. </p>
<p> 3. Internet connection problems </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing internet connection problems, try clearing the browser cache and data. If the issue persists, check this article for additional solutions. </p>
<p> 4. Bluetooth problems </p>
<p> A few users reported an unusual Bluetooth problem that prevents them from pairing their phone with a Bluetooth device. Apparently, there’s still no real solution to this problem. Hopefully, Samsung will address the pairing issue in some of the future updates. </p>
<p> Sure, I can tell you to try generic solutions like restarting your phone, re-establishing the connection, check if the Airplane mode is disabled, but I doubt any of these will actually resolve the problem. It won’t hurt if you try, though. </p>
<p> 5. Battery drains </p>
<p> Battery drain is perhaps the biggest problem A50 owners face right now. And when your phone has a 4000 mAh battery, the last thing you have in mind is a battery drain. But it just seems to be happening. </p>
<p> Apparently, some of the recent updates messed up with battery, so there’s really nothing you can do, except waiting for Samsung to release a fixing update. Nobody knows when will it happen, so keep checking every day. </p>
<p> In the meantime, make sure some other factors don’t affect the battery life. For example, go to Settings > Battery usage, and see which app consumes the most power. If you notice something unusual, uninstall or at least limit that app. </p>
<p> 6. Can’t play Netflix in HD </p>
<p> In case you’re unable to play Netflix videos in HD, I have bad news for you. Streaming Netflix in HD is not supported on the Galaxy A50! But it shouldn’t be like this, because the Galaxy A50 supports the Widevine L1 DRM, which is enough to play HD videos on streaming platforms. </p>
<p> However, even if the phone has the prerequisites, Netflix is hesitant to allow it to stream HD content for some reason. Nobody knows when/if this conflict will be resolved. What we do know is that some older versions of the Netflix app actually allow HD content, which adds up to the confusion even more. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, if you can’t live without watching Netflix in HD, you can install an APK file of some previous version of the app. According to users, the last working version is Netflix 6.20.1 build 51 31579. </p>
<p> 7. Screen brightness too high </p>
<p> Samsung’s AMOLED displays are great, maybe the best in the business! But the vibrant colors and screen brightness might seem a bit unusual, especially for users coming from IPS displays. </p>
<p> So, if the screen on your new Galaxy A50 appears too bright, it’s just the way Samsung AMOLED displays work and should look. However, you can still adjust some settings to make the screen more appealing to your eyes. </p>
<p> Just go to settings, and change the screen mode to Basic. Even if you’re not satisfied with the end result, give it some time for your eyes and brain to get accustomed to the new vibrant screen. </p>
<p> That’s about it. If you’ve encountered a problem I didn’t list in this article or you have some additional questions, write it down in the comments below, and we’ll try to find the solution together. </p>
<p> 91 COMMENTS </p>
<p> Having trouble with SIM cards ! Had the phone 8 months. Replaced it twice and took it out and put it back in. Been telling me no sim card. The first three times that I had trouble with it I took it to the store. To have them replace it. Was wondering if anyone else had this trouble ? </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/galaxy-a70-issues" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844088" filename="galaxy-a70-issues">
<p> Samsung Galaxy A70 common problems and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung has firmly re-entered the midrange segment this year. Users already love the company’s budget champion, the Galaxy A50, and its bigger brother, the A70, only improves on an already strong base. </p>
<p> Sure, the A70 might not be the best value for money in the whole A series, but it offers something authentic. It brings a good portion of the Galaxy Note experience with its huge AMOLED display. Only for the chunk of the price. If you value big phones, but don’t want to spend a small fortune, the Galaxy A70 is a way to go. You probably think the same way, and that’s why you just bought this device. </p>
<p> But then, the first problems start to appear. And there aren’t too many things as annoying as problems on a phone fresh out of the box. That’s why I compiled a list of the most common problems with the Galaxy A70 for you. Just find the issue that’s bothering you, and you’ll either find a solution, or understand the problem better. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Touch screen issues </p>
<p> When the phone’s highlight feature is its display, the last thing you’d want or expect is some screen-related problem. Unfortunately, that appears to be exactly the biggest problem with the A70. Forums are flooded with reports complaining about touch screen issues, of whom the biggest problem appears to be the multi-touch. </p>
<p> Apparently, users are having multi-touch issues in games that use the movement stick, like PUBG. Namely, when you drag the stick to keep moving, it stops registering your finger, so you have to lift it and press the stick again. </p>
<p> I couldn’t find a solution to this problem anywhere. That means Samsung will probably address it in an update. However, there are reports about users already receiving an update that claims to fix the multi-touch issue, but it still persists. </p>
<p> I can only advise you to keep checking for new updates, and hope for the best. Hopefully, Samsung will deal with this problem once and for all in the future. </p>
<p> 2. Wi-Fi problems </p>
<p> One user has reported on Samsung forums that he’s unable to connect to his home Wi-Fi network. Other than that, Wi-Fi doesn’t appear to be the problem on the A70. Nevertheless, if you can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network, make sure everything’s okay with your router first. </p>
<p> If you can’t connect to any Wi-Fi network, try some of the solutions listed in this article. </p>
<p> 3. Overheating issue </p>
<p> Just like the reported Wi-Fi problem, overheating doesn’t appear to be a widespread problem with the Galaxy A70. However, it’s been reported, so I feel like I should include it, anyway. </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing overheating on your brand new Galaxy A70, try some of the following workarounds: </p>
<p> Disable background services, like Bluetooth, NFC, location, etc. </p>
<p> Lower the screen brightness. </p>
<p> Disable the always-on display. </p>
<p> Try a different case. </p>
<p> Install the latest updates. </p>
<p> 4. Fingerprint scanner not working </p>
<p> Another new feature the A series brings to the table is the in-display fingerprint scanner. And once again, the real-life results are great, to say the least. There are numerous reports on the forums about the A70’s fingerprint scanner either being slow or not working at all. </p>
<p> Sure, this is still a first-generation technology, and you shouldn’t expect it to work flawlessly 100% of the time. Plus, the fact that Samsung doesn’t use premium hardware in the A70 doesn’t help. But still, you want it to function to a degree where it’s at least usable. </p>
<p> Some users have reported that the fingerprint scanner started working normally after a few updates. On the other hand, some say the issue persists even on up-to-date devices. So, the only thing left for you, if you’re experiencing the fingerprint scanner issues, is to keep checking for updates and hope for the best. If the problem persists, consider replacing your phone at the store. </p>
<p> 5. Lags while gaming </p>
<p> A few reports suggest that users are expiriencing lags while gaming. Esentially, this is true, but it’s probably not a problem per se. This alleged lagging issue is actually CPU throtthling caused by a high temperature. In case you’re not familiar with the term, when your phone reaches a certain temperature, it automatically “throttles” the speed of both GPU and CPU to prevent overheating. That process is called “throttling”. </p>
<p> So, if you’ve been gaming for an extensive period of time, your phone will reach a certain temperature, and it will throttle the power of your hardware. Which means you’ll have less resources to work with, and your performance will suffer. Especially in more demanding games. </p>
<p> In that manner, if your game starts stuttering, just put your phone down for an hour, and let it cool off. You shouldn’t experience any more lagging problems afterwards. Additionally, this can also happen if your phone already overheats, like mentioned above. In that case, try some of the recommended solutions to prevent overheating. </p>
<p> That’s about it. As you can see, there aren’t too many things to worry about with the A70, which makes this phone a pretty sure bet. Sure, possible touch screen problems could get annoying but you’ll get used to it eventually. And who knows, maybe Samsung will resolve everything with a future update. </p>

<p> I frequently have the problem, whereas the whole screen of my samsung A70 is unresponsive. Can’t turn off/restart, due to the fact that you need to drag your finger across the touchscreen to select those option, on a phone, where the touchscreen is UNRESPONSIVE. This has been so frustrating. But, however, I accidentally cracked the code, on how to get the screen to respond, at least on my device. (can’t guarantee it works on all faulty devices.) Frantically press the on/off bottom on the bottom right side, while simultaneously dragging your finger across the camera symbol that’s in the bottom… Read more » </p>
<p> Today this happened for the first time on my A70 and your method has worked. Thanks very much. </p>

<p> I try to make a call. Evidently it rings on the other end but nothing on my end. I have to make a call 2 or 3 times to make a connection. I hope I don’t need to make a 911 call. Xfinity did a hard reset with no help. One lady suggested a new sim card, but her manager said that won’t help. </p>
<p> I too am having the same issue. I tried calling out I cannot hear the ringing or answer. Then I tried with the bluetooth while drivign and each time it looked like it would connect then drop. When someone calls me, I keep touching answer and it will not answer . So… just hope I do not need 911 either </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy M30s common issues and solutions </p>
<p> Samsung’s mid-range lineup in 2019 is probably the best one yet. There’s something for everyone in this more affordable segment, and if your focus is battery life, you might want to consider the Samsung Galaxy M30s. This is a well-rounded handset with quite a chunky battery. We checked out the interwebz and brought all common issues that Samsung Galaxy M30s users reported. </p>
<p> Besides that, we have some solutions along with the listed bugs and issues, to help you resolve them swiftly. Check them out below. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Phone restarts on its own </p>
<p> Among many minor bugs and temporary issues, this problem definitely took our attention. It seems that the M30s restarts on its own for some users, as reported on the official forum. When something like this happens without users meddling with the stock ROM, we strongly suspect a hardware failure to be the cause. </p>
<p> That’s why it’s more than recommended to take your device for a repair or ask for the replacement as soon as possible. </p>
<p> 2. Lags and stutters </p>
<p> Another problem we can put in the category of more major ones is frequent lags. Now, considering the Samsung Galaxy M30s has a mid-range chipset, it wouldn’t be a surprise if lags and stutters appeared in some demanding games. However, it seems that these happen even when just browsing the web or doing some regular non-demanding operations. </p>
<p> For some users, slowdowns and lags started happening after the One UI 2 (Android 10) update. Others experienced it on Android Pie, as well. If you are affected by lags and stutters on the Samsung Galaxy M30s, make sure to try these steps to fix it: </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Try booting into Safe Mode and look for improvements. If the device performs better, continue with the steps. </p>
<p> Lower the Animation scale in Developer options from 1 to 0.5. </p>
<p> Limit the number of background apps in Developer options. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 3. Battery drain </p>
<p> This is one of the phones with the biggest battery in this selling segment. The Samsung Galaxy M30s packs an enormous 6000 mAh battery which gives this device enormous endurance ratings. However, users are definitely not satisfied when the SoT (Screen-on Time) significantly dropping, and the fingers are pointed at bad network reception. </p>
<p> If you are experiencing battery drainage on the Galaxy M30s, make sure to check these steps: </p>
<p> Disable background apps. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi, Location Services, and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Ensure that the network signal is strong. If the device is constantly searching for network coverage, it will deplete the battery quickly. </p>
<p> Disable Adaptive brightness and set the brightness manually. </p>
<p> 4. Overheating </p>
<p> That powerful battery requires needs approximately 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100 with the provided 15W charger. During the charging, many users stated that the device is hot on touch. Also, it seems that the charging speeds vary for some, as it occasionally takes much more to charge the device. </p>
<p> First of all, make a habit of removing the protective case from the device while charging. Additionally, we strongly recommend using the original charger with the original cable to avoid OTG issues on the Samsung Galaxy M30s. Finally, try not to use your device while charging. </p>
<p> 5. OTG not working </p>
<p> Using the OTG (On-The-Go USB) can be quite useful for some users. You can connect a DSLR, USB flash drive, mouse/keyboard or some other Android devices smartphones or tablets. However, some users are having a hard time with OTG on their Samsung Galaxy M30s. </p>
<p> For some of them, the connected device (M30s being a host device) wasn’t showing. Now, whether that’s a mouse, keyboard, or something else, the problem can be resolved by following these steps: </p>
<p> Format USB flash drive to a different format before connecting to your handset. </p>
<p> Use the generic cable. </p>
<p> Reverse the OTG cable (it seems nonsensical but it worked for some). </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6. Camera issues </p>
<p> One issue with certain OEMs that slowly grew out of nowhere is the lack of Camera2API support. Without it, it’s really hard to port Google Camera and take full advantage of that crispy software processing. The Samsung Galaxy M30s (with Exynos chip) falls into a group of devices that, without rooting at least, can’t take the best of Google’s modded camera. </p>
<p> Now, that wouldn’t be a major issue if the stock camera is working well. Which, based on reports of some users, isn’t exactly the case. Even though the device packs a good set of lenses (standard, ultra-wide, and depth sensor + front camera), it seems that photo quality isn’t the best. Especially on the selfie camera. </p>
<p> For the time being, you can check the settings and tweak them a bit. Until a proper GCAM port becomes available, at least. </p>
<p> 7. Display issues on the Samsung Galaxy M30s </p>
<p> Samsung’s AMOLED screens are amazing, even on their mid-range devices. The 6.4-inch Super AMOLED that’s on the Samsung Galaxy M30s is great if not for minor issues some users voiced on the official forum. </p>
<p> It seems that ghost touch is bothering some, while others are not satisfied with the color precision. There’s also the yellowish tint for some. </p>
<p> If you encountered one or multiple display issues, make sure to try solving them with the steps below: </p>
<p> Remove the screen protector if you experience ghost touch. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and run it in the Safe Mode. </p>
<p> Tweak color settings in the Display > Screen mode. Choose Vivid instead of Natural. </p>
<p> Disable Night Light. </p>
<p> Reset the M30s to factory settings. </p>
<p> 8. App crashes </p>
<p> Nothing says there’s something wrong with the Android OS like random app crashes. Now, if a third-party app crashes, the problem is more straightforward. However, even the Camera and Phone apps crash regularly for some users. </p>
<p> If you are having a problem with app crashes, whether third-party apps or the system apps, make sure to follow these steps: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps and clear cache and data from the affected apps. Reboot your phone and give it another go. </p>
<p> Do the same for Google Framework Services. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition data. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 9. Mobile data not working (3G/4G) </p>
<p> Mobile Data and poor network reception issues, in general, are probably the most reported issue for the Samsung Galaxy M30s we run into. Samsung responded and offered some insights and ways to circumvent this. </p>
<p> Now, it seems that the troubleshooting steps they provided addressed the problem for some, while others are still having issues with mobile data not working at all or poor call quality due to abysmal network reception. </p>
<p> Check these steps in order to solve issues with mobile data and poor network reception: </p>
<p> Update your firmware. </p>
<p> Remove and re-insert the SIM card. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Connection > Mobile Networks > Network mode and select Auto-mode. </p>
<p> Follow the same path and open Network operators. Choose Select automatically. </p>
<p> Reset APN to defaults. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 10. Adaptive brightness issue </p>
<p> Moving on. The automatic brightness on Samsung devices is, just like their displays, usually well-configured and sensors do their job as intended. </p>
<p> However, it seems that the Samsung Galaxy M30s has a big discrepancy between the highest automatic brightness and the manual one. Users who decided to toggle brightness manually are not satisfied with this. </p>
<p> Some users suggested that the problem lies in the Device Health Service and, once you reset the app, the highest manual brightness should resemble the automatic one. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reset the Device Health Service app: </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Open Device Health Service. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> 11. The fingerprint sensor is slow </p>
<p> It’s not strange when an under-the-display fingerprint sensor underperforms as this is quite a new technology. What is strange are issues with the rear-mounted capacitive sensor, which seems to be super-slow for some users. It seems that the problems started after a system update. </p>
<p> If the fingerprint scanner is too slow on the Samsung Galaxy M30s, there’s hardly anything you can do except keep your device’s firmware up to date. However, following these steps might be worth a try: </p>
<p> Clean the fingerprint scanner with a slightly wet cloth. </p>
<p> Remove all enrolled fingerprints and add a new one. You can also add one finger multiple times to improve the reading speed. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 12. Always-on display not working </p>
<p> The AoD (Always On Display) mode is Samsung’s calling card for so many years. The South Korean giant popularized OLED displays with this among other features. It allows you to keep tabs on all notifications while not sacrificing battery life. </p>
<p> However, it seems that AoD is not working on this device for some users. To be precise, alternative options and clocks (from Samsung Themes) are not working but the default AoD works just as intended on the Samsung Galaxy M30s. </p>
<p> If that’s the case for you, check these steps to resolve it swiftly: </p>
<p> Clear the cache and data from the Always On Display app. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Lock screen > Clock style. Choose Always On Display clock from a third-party theme. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 13. Common troubleshooting steps for Samsung Galaxy M30s </p>
<p> Enable Developer options </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open About phone. </p>
<p> Then tap on the Build number 7 times until the prompt informs you that the Developer options are unlocked. You might need to enter your PIN or Password. </p>
<p> The Developer options should appear in the main Settings menu. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button until the Power menu appears. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Power Off icon until you see the Safe Mode prompt. </p>
<p> Tap again to restart your device into the Safe Mode. </p>
<p> To exit the Safe Mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> Back up your data from the internal storage (photos can be saved to Google Photos, other media can be saved to an external storage or a PC). </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > General management > Reset. </p>
<p> Select Factory data reset. </p>
<p> Follow instructions to reset your device to factory values. </p>
<p> That should be it. Thank you for reading and we hope this article pinpointed the most common Samsung Galaxy M30s issues correctly. In case you have issues we omitted from the list, or alternative solutions to recommend, feel free to do so in the comments section below. </p>

<p> My AOD ‘Biggest centered clock’ is slightly off from the center. Anyone has this issue? Sometimes after locking phone the whole screen brights up with grains seen in TV when there is no signal. This happens for a split second then the off centres Aod appears. </p>

<p> Even though we are expecting the Note 8 by the end of the year, some of the older Samsung devices are still viable options, like the Note 5, introduced back in 2015. This device recently received an upgrade to Nougat, which was indeed an upgrade and not the downgrade like for some other Samsung handsets. That made this already great device even better. </p>
<p> But, if there’s a software without an issue or missteps, then we wouldn’t need upgrades/patches in the first place, do we? And one of the best Samsung’s hybrid phones is not without issues. Namely, a lot of users reported Wi-Fi connectivity issues that are somewhat specific to this device. Some of them were able to connect but the connection was lackluster, others, well, they were not so lucky. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we prepared a list of workarounds that should fix the issue or, at least, improve your connection. You can find those below. </p>
<p> Forget Network and connect again </p>
<p> First and the simplest step you could take when addressing Wi-Fi issues is forget/establish procedure. It’s even advised to forget your trusted network occasionally even when everything works great. This is the counterpart of the router restart, so you’ll clear any possible network conflicts. And yes, while we’re at it, restart your router, as well. </p>
<p> Press and hold on Wi-Fi icon in the Notification panel to open Wi-Fi settings. </p>
<p> Click on the network you need to re-establish. </p>
<p> Tap Forget. </p>
<p> Restart your Note 5 and connect again. </p>
<p> Reset network settings </p>
<p> Another common solution for network issues is the reset of network settings. But, don’t forget that this will clear all of your saved network settings and restore them to a factory values. This is how to do it on your Note 5: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> Enter password/PIN/pattern if prompted and tap RESET SETTINGS. </p>
<p> Your device will restart and you can start from a scratch. </p>
<p> Disable IPv6 protocol on your router </p>
<p> Some users succeeded to fix connection issues by disabling the IPv6 protocol on their router and stick to the IPv4 protocol. You can make your changes to the router settings via a browser. Just open your browser and under address bar type your IP address. Insert your username and password provided by your internet provider. Now, you just got to disable Auto IPv6 protocol and you’re good to go. </p>
<p> Use 5 GHz instead of 2.4 GHz and vice versa </p>
<p> Another workaround you can apply for this issue is changing your Wi-Fi band. It’s not certain what may work for you so make sure to try both of them and hope for the improvements. Simply put, the 5 GHz band has a wider range while the 2.4 GHz is known for a more stable connection. </p>
<p> The procedure is different on different routers, so you can google your router and find the way how to switch bands. </p>
<p> Update to Nougat </p>
<p> If you’ve already obtained Nougat, you can skip this step. However, if you’re still running Lolipop or Marshmallow on your Note 5, we advise you to check for the updates immediately. Yes, there is a slight chance that something may go wrong once you install the latest update. However, if it’s to believe to numerous users, the seventh edition of Android works like a charm on Note 5. </p>
<p> If your system update is not set on auto, you can check for it manually. Follow the instructions to check for available system update: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About phone. </p>
<p> Open Software version. </p>
<p> Tap Search for updates. </p>
<p> If an update is available, click Download & Install. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition </p>
<p> One of the solutions that proved helpful for a majority of users is wiping cache partition under the recovery mode. We advise you to try it first prior to a factory reset since this operation will preserve your data. You can perform it in a few easy steps and here are the instructions how to do it: </p>
<p> Turn off the device. Make sure that your battery is not critically low. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Up key + Home key + Power button. </p>
<p> Once the logo appears on the screen, release the Power button while holding the Volume Up key + Home key. </p>
<p> Wait for the Android logo to appear and release all buttons. </p>
<p> Use the Volume Down key to find and highlight the ‘wipe cache partition’ option. </p>
<p> Use the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Now, scroll down with the Volume Down key and highlight ”Yes”. </p>
<p> Press Power button to select. </p>
<p> After the procedure is finished, restart your device and check for changes </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset </p>
<p> At the end, the one thing that no one is willingly doing may be your last resort. Factory reset should clear any of the possible issues within the system. However, it will also clear all of your data and settings, restoring them to their factory values. Nonetheless, if you’re not keen to wait for the developers to address this issue, you may as well do it. And this is how to do it in a few simple steps: </p>
<p> Back up your data, remove the SD card and make sure your battery is not critically low. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Tap Factory data reset. </p>
<p> You may be prompted to enter password/PIN/pattern before the cleanup begins. </p>
<p> That should be that. Don’t forget to share your experience with the Wi-Fi or suggest some other solution. We’ll be glad to hear from you. </p>

<p> Galaxy S10 issues with Android 10 (OneUI 2): RAM, bootloops, and more </p>
<p> Samsung has started rolling out Android 10 (or the company’s in-house skin, OneUI 2, if you like) to all Galaxy S10 devices in the US. Both unlocked and carrier-locked. The update introduces all the goodies Android 10 has to offer to S10 owners, including an improved dark mode, navigation gestures, and more. </p>
<p> On the other hand, the first public version of OneUI 2 also brings its own set of issues. There are numerous reports on various forums about all sorts of issues that came “pre-installed” with the brand new OneUI 2. </p>
<p> Since most of the issues are fresh, we still don’t have too many valid solutions. So, in case you encountered a certain problem, your best bet is to follow dedicated forums, and perhaps someone will find a way to fix your problem. </p>
<p> Assistants not working </p>
<p> Unlike most Android phones, users can play with two big assistants on Samsung devices. Bixby and Google Assistant. However, one user said that he’s unable to use “assistants” after installing the update. The user, however, didn’t precise which assistant doesn’t work with OneUI 2. </p>
<p> “So far with the new UI my device assistants aren’t working and I’m constantly being told I have no connection when I am connected to wifi, the same thing happens on and off with my mobile network connection. I hope they’re already working on a patch to fix this.” </p>
<p> Unable to install apps after updating to OneUI 2 </p>
<p> Another user reported on the XDA forums that he’s unable to update and install apps upon updating to OneUI 2. </p>
<p> “I have a Stock Xfinity S10 phone, recently I have had problems installing or updating apps. I tried everything, I even wiped out the phone, I even wiped out the phone and did not restore any settings or apps. When I do that, it worked fine for about a day or so, and then for some reason, it will not update or install apps. </p>
<p> Issues are: apps download to 99% or 100% but never get to the install phase. just sit there forever! I sometimes can install an app if it gets to 100%, it kills the app store. It somehow will show as installed when I reopen the app store. But other than that, it’s just a huge struggle. ANY IDEAS?! I am clueless, I cleared out the phone, no luck! I need help.. thank you!” </p>
<p> Ram usage issues </p>
<p> Galaxy S10 boasts 8GB of RAM, so stuttering and poor app performance is not something you’d expect. However, as one user reported, OneUI 2 appears to be causing some RAM issues. </p>
<p> “I find the recent update One UI 2.0 / android 10 making my ram management worst. Before I don’t even notice my apps reloading but now that I’m updated to android 10. I get app to reload from time to time. Are you guys experiencing it too?” </p>
<p> Bootloop after the update </p>
<p> All of the issues listed above are more or less harmless. But when your phone enters a bootloop after installing an update, there’s always a reason to worry. And that’s exactly what happened to one user of the XDA forums. </p>
<p> “This morning I saw that I can update to the new Android 10 version on my Galaxy S10. I was happy and of course, updated directly. Everything worked fine, the update was downloaded, installed and the phone rebooted. </p>
<p> And from there it hung in a boot loop. mI had already unlocked the bootloader 2 months ago, but only to flash the original firmware again because of an unsuccessful attempt to install TWRP. </p>
<p> Now the Galaxy S10 starts up, shows the information that the boot loader has been unlocked and then the boot logo and vibrates. Then it goes straight off and starts again. I cannot use the key combinations to get into the recovery or in the download mode.” </p>
<p> Right now, we still don’t know the exact solution for the bootloop problem. So, in case you’ve experienced something similar, I suggest you follow this XDA forums thread for the potential solution. </p>
<p> In case you’ve encountered a problem I didn’t list in this article, feel free to share it with us in the comments below. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy S10 pre-order goes live in the US! </p>
<p> The whole world has been crazy about the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S10 for the past few months. Samsung’s upcoming punch-hole pioneer is arguably the most leaked device ever. We already (think we) know everything about this device, from its final design to the price range. </p>
<p> And now, Samsung has made its first move towards finally unveiling this device. Namely, starting today the Samsung Galaxy S10 is available for pre-order in the US! </p>
<p> However, this offer just serves as some kind of reservation, because it won’t automatically place an order once the new device gets unveiled. Instead, signing up during the Reservation Period will give you priority in actual pre-ordering, so you’ll eventually receive your device earlier. </p>
<p> Here’s what the pre-order page says: </p>
<p> “Please note that simply reserving your device during the Reservation Period will not automatically place an order. To place the order and receive Samsung’s next flagship Galaxy device, after you place your reservation, you must return to Samsung.com or the App and fully complete the order transaction within the 72 hour period after the device goes on sale. If you do not return to Samsung.com or the App to complete your order, your reservation will be cancelled automatically and you will no longer have reserved priority for placing an order to receive the next Galaxy device, and your ability to place an order going forward will be subject to availability of devices and any shipping times available at the time of your order.” </p>
<p> Samsung also offers decent trade-in options that will reduce the price by up to $550. Eligible trade-in devices include smartphones from Samsung, Apple, LG, Google, and Motorola. You can find the trade-in value of your device on the pre-order page. </p>
<p> On top of that, Samsung also allows you to choose the desired carrier, from the list of all major US carriers. There’s also the Unlocked version, which we assume will cost more. </p>
<p> If you reserve your new Galaxy S10 device during the Reservation Period, Samsung promises the delivery by March 8th. </p>

<p> Fix: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge battery drain in Android Nougat </p>
<p> One of the best if not the best Android device of the past year must be the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. We can say with certainty that this device even revolutionized some of the aspects of the modern smartphone. Like that curved display, camera or the amazing non-removable battery (3600 mAh) never seen in a Samsung S flagship before. </p>
<p> However, while the phone opened the path for the upcoming S8 series, the adaptation to Nougat OS hasn’t gone as expected. At least for some of the users. Namely, after the update to Nougat, a lot of users encountered noticeable battery life decrease. We can’t be sure what’s the exact reason for that, but the main suspect is the unoptimized system. For the long-awaited upgrade, they indeed made some critical errors. </p>
<p> Until a new firmware patch resolves this issue, we are presenting you with a few possible workarounds that should help you resolve or at least retain this issue. You can find those in the list below. </p>
<p> Disable background apps </p>
<p> An OS update, can, besides the system preferences, change the app’s behavior. Namely, some of the apps that were less consumptive, may become resource-hogging monsters within seconds. Now, to make things even worse, a lot of apps are not optimized for Nougat, so you can either wait for the update or knowingly disable some of the permissions or background activity and risk an unstable behavior. </p>
<p> If you decide to modify some apps, you can do that this way: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Apps. </p>
<p> Open each app individually and change the permissions and background preferences. </p>
<p> Make sure to check the largest consumers like Facebook, Facebook Messenger etc. </p>
<p> Use Battery Power Saving mode </p>
<p> We are aware that this is not exactly an exceptional solution, mostly because it will set certain boundaries and affect your everyday use. However, if the leak is relentless, you can try and contain it. At least until the folks from the software department fix their broken update. This is how to enable the Power Saving mode on your S7 Edge: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery. </p>
<p> Enable Power Saving mode. </p>
<p> Additionally, you can enable Ultra Power Saving mode, but that will practically transform your flagship into a monoblock-like device. </p>
<p> As we said, this is just the temporary solution until the next update fix battery issues. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> If you performed the previous workarounds and the battery drainage is still present, we can get the big guns into the play. Namely, some users reported that the battery stabilized after they cleared the cache partition. This is more subtle approach than factory reset since your data will remain untouched after the procedure is finished. However, precaution measures are always welcomed, so back up your data and follow the steps below. </p>
<p> Make sure your device battery is at least at 20% and Turn Off the device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the combination of Volume Up, Home, and Power Keys. </p>
<p> Wait until the Android System Recovery screen appears and release all keys. It may last for about 30 seconds most of the time. </p>
<p> Use the Volume Down key to navigate to ”Wipe cache partition”. </p>
<p> Select ”Wipe cache partition” with the single press of the Power button. </p>
<p> Use the Volume Down key to highlight ‘Yes’ and press the Power button to confirm. </p>
<p> After the procedure is finished, confirm ‘Reboot system now’ with the Power button. </p>
<p> Once your S7 Edge restarts, the battery issues should be resolved. Nonetheless, if the problem is persistent, the only remaining solution is factory reset. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset </p>
<p> At the end, you can try with the ultimate DIY solution before you decide to address the problem with your carrier or the responsible service center. And that, of course, is the factory reset. The important thing to remember is to back up your data timely before everything gets completely nuked on both internal storage and SD card. After you tend to your data, follow this steps to restore the factory settings: </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Restore. </p>
<p> Select Factory Data Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Device. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and insert your passcode or PIN. </p>
<p> The process should take about 5-10 minutes. </p>
<p> That should do it. If the problem is still persistent in spite of the complete wipeout, make sure to send a ticket to your service or carrier. It’s quite sad to see that such a premium device suffers from this kind of issues after an unoptimized update. </p>
<p> Don’t forget to tell us about additional issues or post a question about the matter. The comments section is below. </p>

<p> Fix: Samsung Galaxy S7 stock keyboard issues in Android Nougat </p>
<p> Upgrades are, by default, presented as something that should improve users experience and provide the more feature-rich interface. Sadly, that’s not what happened to Samsung keyboard after the Nougat upgrade. </p>
<p> Users are reporting overall usability issues with fun-favorite part of Samsung S7. Since this isn’t exactly a secondary feature but rather a primary, we can’t shy away from criticizing the approach Samsung took in the latest changes. Some users are reporting keyboard crashes while others are supposedly missing the options that were essential in the everyday use. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we prepared a list of workarounds that should, at least, relieve you of the possible bugs that come into play after the latest update. If you have had a hard time adjusting to unpleasant changes, make sure to check the list below. </p>
<p> Update your OS </p>
<p> As we already stated, the problem with the keyboard emerged after the update to Nougat 7.0. Samsung, the market champion, somehow managed to prolong the updates and even, after a long wait, provide its users with underperforming software. The stock keyboard is only one thing that’s affected. </p>
<p> Luckily, they managed to present more firmware updates over time, and some of those are addressing the keyboard bugs. So, a logical step would be to check for the system updates and install them. Most of the time, the Android updates are automatic, but you might as well check for them manually, just in case. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap System update. </p>
<p> If the update is available, tap Install Now. </p>
<p> Restart the keyboard </p>
<p> Standard apps are many times started and closed through the everyday use. That’s not the case for the built-in features that are always active. What you can do with those can’t be done within the user interface. You’ll need to dig deep into the app settings and force them to stop. After that, they reinitialize and, hopefully, work as intended. </p>
<p> Open Apps. </p>
<p> Tap All to bring out the system apps. </p>
<p> Open Samsung Keyboard. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from the keyboard app </p>
<p> Even though the stock keyboard is obviously a pre-installed on your Samsung S7, you can still clear its data and cache. This would remove possible corruption within the essential files. Have in mind that this will erase your personalized dictionary and other keyboard-related settings. </p>
<p> On the other hand, we think that’s worth a shot, especially if you’re accustomed to the stock keyboard. Consequently, it’s better to make it work and configure it from a scratch than to switch to a third-party replacement. </p>
<p> If that’s not working in your favor, you can always reset the personalized keyboard settings from within the keyboard settings themselves. </p>
<p> Reset keyboard personal settings </p>
<p> Everything you do that in some manner includes your Samsung keyboard is stored within the app. Starting from predictions and personal dictionary going to the language of choice and similar settings — everything is stored in here. Due to some changes after the update, your Samsung keyboard might be malfunctioning. </p>
<p> In that scenario, an obvious step is to reset the keyboard to factory settings so you can hopefully use your Samsung Galaxy S7 just like before the ”upgrade” emerged. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to reset the keyboard to factory settings and resolve the issue at hand: </p>
<p> Open Language and input. </p>
<p> Scroll to the bottom. </p>
<p> Tap Reset settings. </p>
<p> Use an alternative keyboard </p>
<p> As you’re probably aware, there’s an abundance of different keyboards on the Play Store. We are well aware that the Samsung’s native keyboard was the input of choice for the majority of Samsung users, but until they sort it out, you can check for alternatives. The first keyboard that crosses our mind is Google’s solution is this department, called Gboard. Due to close relation to other Android’s Google-powered features, it should be a most viable replacement for Samsung keyboard. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can roam through Play Store and find something else. As we already stated, there are so many keyboard apps out there, that there’s a great chance you’ll find something that suits you feature-wise. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if your bond with the Samsung keyboard’s performance on Marshmallow is too strong, you can always perform a factory reset. It won’t get you back to the previous version of Android OS (that’s where flashing comes into play), but it still should clear the infringement created while upgrading. </p>
<p> We advise you to use a PC suite to backup your files, so you can later restore them with ease. On the other hand, you can backup your data on cloud service and restore it within the device itself without PC. </p>
<p> Open Backup and Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Factory Data Reset. </p>
<p> After the device resets, and the process is finished, you can restore your files. Hopefully, your keyboard will regain the previous functionality. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. We certainly hope that some of these workarounds proved helpful. Additionally, don’t forget to share your experience or post a question in the comments section below. We look forward to it. </p>

<p> Fix: Samsung Galaxy S7 won’t connect to wireless headphones </p>
<p> The headphone jack is slowly but steadily on its way to history. However, that doesn’t mean the older phones with 3.5mm audio jack won’t thrive when combined with a wireless headset: headphones or nowadays-popular earbuds. At least, when they behave. Namely, a lot of Samsung Galaxy S7 users reported connection issues concerning wireless headphones. </p>
<p> For some reason, allegedly, Bluetooth connection is simply out for good and the pairing can’t be done whatever they try. For that purpose, we prepared a list of possible solutions, in hope that one (or more) will help you resolve the issue at hand. </p>
<p> If your S7 and wireless headphones/earbuds won’t connect, make sure to check them out below. </p>
<p> How to resolve wireless headphone connection issues on S7 </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Hold Power button longer </p>
<p> The pairing sequence issues are commonly wrongly predicated on the S7 itself. Each headphone, depending on manufacturer and the model, carries different pairing sequence. And you’ll need to follow it carefully in order to pair the handset and wireless headphones. </p>
<p> For example, the common reports of the aforementioned problem include Plantronics wireless headphones. Users initially paired headphones with the Galaxy S7, but after an update, Bluetooth settings where gone and the issues emerged. They were just unable to pair it again. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to check the instructions provided with the headphones or on the official support site. One thing which seems to be commonly helpful includes holding the power button on headphones for an extra few seconds until the visual/sound signal confirms pairing is successful. </p>
<p> However, even though Samsung isn’t exactly as good as Pixel in regards to ‘fixing fixes’, some of the updates might’ve addressed this issue. Additionally, taking into consideration that this is the commonly-reported problem, chances are that updating firmware will provide the resolution. </p>
<p> Here’s how to update the firmware on your Galaxy S7: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap System update. </p>
<p> If the update is available, tap Install Now. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Restart Bluetooth service </p>
<p> On the other hand, we can’t be certain that the device itself isn’t causing the issue at hand. Namely, some users tackled the issue by resetting the Bluetooth service in the Applications menu. This can come in handy whenever you try to troubleshoot the system-related services, which Bluetooth certainly is. </p>
<p> If you’re unsure how to reset Bluetooth service, follow the instructions we provided below: </p>
<p> Expand Control pane and enable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Applications. </p>
<p> Click on the 3-dot menu and tap Show system services. </p>
<p> Choose Storage. </p>
<p> Clear both Cache and Data. </p>
<p> Restart your device and try pairing with headphones again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Disable wireless and mobile data </p>
<p> Another thing you could try out (we won’t invest too much hope in this, though) is disabling wireless and mobile data while pairing with the wireless headphones via Bluetooth. For some unknown reason, wireless and mobile data block Bluetooth connection. </p>
<p> This, of course, means that you should disable all other available connections for the time being until the handset and headphones are paired. After the pairing is finally finished, you can re-enable wireless or mobile data. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Enable NFC </p>
<p> Various modern earbuds and headphones require NFC Easy Connect in order to work in a seamless manner. Those are still rare, but if you can find the ‘N’ letter on your wireless speaker driver, make sure to enable NFC before moving to a pairing procedure. </p>
<p> The procedure is simple. Once you’re in the Main menu, you should see NFC Easy Access under the Connectivity. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Reset phone to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous solutions proved fruitful, we can only advise you to, either wipe the cache partition data or reset your device to factory settings. Samsung Galaxy S7 is a brilliant device on paper. However, after some time, due to updates and pilled cache, the problems will start occurring more frequently rather than occasionally. </p>
<p> Some even say that the full functionality is to be expected for 2 years. After that, both software and hardware can cause issues. Hardware-wise, there’s only so much you can do. On the other hand, by resetting the phone to factory settings, the software will liven up. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, don’t forget to backup your data on a PC, an external drive, or cloud service of your choice. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset S7 to factory settings and, hopefully, manage to connect to wireless headphones afterward: </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Restore. </p>
<p> Choose Factory Data Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Device. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and insert your passcode or PIN. </p>
<p> With that, we can wrap it up. We can only hope that this was an insightful article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share your suggestions, additional issues, or questions in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/galaxy-s8-fingerprint-scanner-not-responding" parent_folder="web1" id="file17845611" filename="galaxy-s8-fingerprint-scanner-not-responding">
<p> Fix: Samsung Galaxy S8 Fingerprint scanner not responding </p>
<p> Galaxy S8 is finally out! And, oh, boy, we’re in for a treat! First impressions are mostly positive and Samsung’s latest flagship is in the race for the smartphone of the year with the great battery, futuristic bezel-less design, an iris scanner, and it’s own smart assistant that promises a lot. </p>
<p> You would imagine that the premium device like S8 doesn’t have a lot of flaws. And, for all intents and purposes, it doesn’t. But there into play comes Samsung’s notorious system update that always brings out the bag of issues. Today, we’ll try to address the fingerprint scanner that got unresponsive after the update. One user posted the query and this is his explanation of the problem at hand: </p>
<p> ”After the software update that came out a few days ago, my fingerprint scanner hasn’t been responding. I used to use it to unlock my phone. Now it isn’t picking up that I have my finger there. I went into settings and deleted my fingerprints I had registered. Then when I went to re-register my prints it would not pick up that my finger was there.” </p>
<p> So, if you have similar issues with your brand new Galaxy S8, these are some workarounds that you can use to resolve this issue. </p>
<p> Clean your fingerprint scanner </p>
<p> For starters, let’s clean the fingerprint scanner. Even the smallest particles of dust can create a problem with the fingerprint readings. You can use any soft material like cloth, apply a little water on it, and wipe gently over the surface of the reader. After that, you can use the dry cloth to rub any remaining liquid from the scanner. </p>
<p> Have in mind that these are just the precaution measures and that this is, at least most of the time, a software issue. </p>
<p> Restart your device </p>
<p> Once we got the exterior of the reader sorted out, let’s move to a more reasonable culprit for this issue: annoying software bug. We won’t place our bets on the restart as the permanent solution, but, you’ll at least be able to use the fingerprint reader for some time. </p>
<p> The first step you can take when it comes to bugs is to simply turn it off and on again. After the phone is on, check for changes with the fingerprint scanner. However, if the problem is still there, check the steps below before sending the angry ticket to responsible service or carrier. </p>
<p> Disable fingerprint gestures </p>
<p> Now we have reached the climax. Most of the folks seem to neglect the fact that the Nougat upgrade is a major miss for the South Korean megacorp. Yes, some of the features are more than welcomed, but what’s with the negative effects Android 7.0 had cast upon the Galaxy devices? </p>
<p> And, for a lot of users of S8, the latest update broken the fingerprint recognition. Or, to be more exact, the fingerprint gestures that are great and quite a useful feature. Some users reported that they retrieved fingerprint function by disabling fingerprint gestures. If you’re unsure how to do that, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Advanced features. </p>
<p> Navigate to Finger sensor gestures and toggle it off. </p>
<p> Now you should be able to use only the unlock function of the fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> As you can see, this is a temporary solution and all you can do is wait for the next update to fix the bug. Then, hopefully, you’ll be able to use the gestures again. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings </p>
<p> At the end, if you’re willing to trade your custom setup and saved data for the possible resolution of this issue, the factory reset is a viable solution. We’re aware that this is an undesirable action for most of the users, but there’s a great chance that you’ll resolve your issues. On the other hand, you can wait for the next update to sort it out. </p>
<p> If you’re unaware how to perform the factory reset on your S8, the instructions are just below. Of course, don’t forget to backup your data. You can use the PC suite to back it up on your PC or the cloud services to back it up online. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset device. </p>
<p> Confirm with the Erase everything. </p>
<p> The phone will restart and, hopefully, your fingerprint scanner issue will be gone for good. </p>
<p> That’s it. Don’t forget to report the problem to Samsung, as they can’t repair something that they’re not aware of. Additionally, we’ll like to hear your first impressions of the device and are you satisfied with what you’ve got. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/galaxy-s8-led-light-notification-bug" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844256" filename="galaxy-s8-led-light-notification-bug">
<p> Fix: Samsung Galaxy S8 LED Light notifications not working </p>
<p> One of the earliest problems of the Galaxy S8 is the LED light notification problem. This has been a widespread problem, as various forums across the internet are still flooded with various complaints by users. </p>
<p> If you’re still experiencing LED light bugs on your brand new Samsung Galaxy S8, you’ve come to the right place. We’re going to discuss the issue here, and look for potential workarounds for this annoying issue. </p>
<p> There are a few workarounds you can try to fix the S8 LED light problem: </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Install updates </p>
<p> As I already mentioned, this problem hit the Galaxy S8 community by storm in May this year. Users were desperate, and there was no confirmed solution on sigth. </p>
<p> Some time after that, users have started reporting that the issue gets resolved after updating the phone. Which means Samsung acknowledged the problem, and released the proper patch. </p>
<p> If you’re still getting the same LED light problem, it’s very likely that you still haven’t installed the needed update on your phone. Which is exactly what you should do now. </p>
<p> So, head over to Settigns > About, and update the phone. If the update is available, it will get installed on your computer, and (hopefully) the LED light bug will be resolved. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the issue is still present after installing all updates, move on to another solution. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Update apps </p>
<p> There’s also a chance some of your apps are simply incompatiblile with this feature. If that’s the case, there’s really nothing you can do. But wait for the app developer to release an update that will make the app compatible with S8’s LED light feature. </p>
<p> So, go to the Google Play Store or Samsung Store, and make sure all your apps are up to date. If developers found a way to resolve this irregularity, you’ll surely receive the fix through updates. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Change the notification sound </p>
<p> In some cases, there’s no bug or issue at all. It’s just how Android and Samsung’s LED light work together. Namely, many people don’t know that LED notifications actually require sound to work. So, if your phone is set to silent, or notifications for a certain app are set to silent, your phone simply won’t get flashy. </p>
<p> So, the obvious solution in this case is to simply turn on the notification sound for the select app, and LED light should be working again. </p>
<p> To turn on the notification sound, do the following: </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Now, head over to Apps & notifications > Notifications > Notifications </p>
<p> Now, find the app you want to customize and tap it </p>
<p> Toggle Allow sound on </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Clear app cache and data </p>
<p> We’ll finsih with one general solution. A few users suggested on the forums that simple clearing of the app cache and data resolves the problem with LED light. So, if none of the solutions from above got the job done, you can try and clear app cache and data of the app that gives you problems. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope at least one of these solutions helped you with the LED light problem. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, let us know in the comments below. </p>

<p> Gboard keeps crashing on Android 11 </p>
<p> Gboard is not everyone’s cup of tea. But, truth to be told, when it is by your liking, style-wise — the overall usability and feature-richness follow. Now, we run into user reports claiming that Gboard keeps crashing on their freshly-updated Android 11-powered devices. </p>
<p> Considering that we already have encountered similar Android issues, we made sure to cover this problem with an array of applicable solutions. Check them out below. </p>
<p> Why does my Gboard keep stopping? </p>
<p> 1. Check Gboard permissions </p>
<p> If your device comes with a preinstalled virtual keyboard and you want to download and use Google Gboard, make sure to check permission settings after the installation. Chances are that Gboard is missing certain permissions and that, in certain scenarios, might lead to crashes. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to inspect Gboard permissions on your Android device: </p>
<p> Choose Apps & notifications. </p>
<p> Choose All apps (See all # apps). </p>
<p> Navigate to Gboard. </p>
<p> Make sure all permissions are granted and that Gboard. </p>
<p> Now, get back to Settings and open System > Languages & input > On-screen keyboard. Make sure that Gboard is set as the default. </p>
<p> 2. Clear Google Play Services and Framework cache </p>
<p> Moving to a brand new one (frequently unpolished) Android version without formatting your device tends to create issues. This might be the reason why Gboard is crashing on Android 11 for some users. </p>
<p> For starters, we recommend clearing Google Play Services and Google Services Framework cache and data from your device. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Navigate again to Settings > Apps & notifications > See all apps. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and tap Show system. </p>
<p> Locate Google Play Services and Google Services Framework, respectively. </p>
<p> Tap Storage & cache and clear cache and data. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and check for improvements. </p>
<p> 3. Leave Gboard Beta program </p>
<p> Many users who experienced a variety of issues with Gboard (bottom spacing, crashes, rotation, etc.), resolved the problem by leaving the Gboard Beta program on the Play Store. Beta versions of various Google services are usually stable, but that might not be the case all the time. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to leave the Beta program: </p>
<p> Open Google Play Store and look for Gboard. </p>
<p> Scroll down and, under the You’re a beta tester section, tap Leave. </p>
<p> After you are removed from the program, you should reinstall the app. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can roll back to an older version of Gboard by installing an APK from any APK-aggro site, like APK Mirror. If the issue persists and Gboard keeps crashing, make sure to try additional steps below. </p>
<p> 4. Clear cache and data </p>
<p> The next step to try considers clearing locally-stored cache and data from your device. That way, possible corruption caused by the major OS update, might be mitigated. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to clear cache and data from the Gboard on Android 11: </p>
<p> Choose All apps. </p>
<p> Navigate to Gboard. </p>
<p> 5. Wipe Cache partition </p>
<p> Alternatively, instead of tackling certain apps to resolve the problem, you can clear all system cache from the Recovery mode. This should address system-wide issues that probably started manifesting after the update. </p>
<p> Here’s how to wipe the cache partition on your Android device: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use the Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Additionally, make sure that your device is up to date. To check for updates, navigate to Settings > System > Advanced > System update. </p>
<p> 6. Disable Chat bubbles </p>
<p> Android 11 brought a few novelties to improve user experience and one of the significant new features is called Chat Bubbles. Namely, Facebook Messenger-like bubbles are now available to all instant messaging apps. </p>
<p> Some already incorporated Chat Bubbles (Telegram, Google Messages, and obviously, Facebook Messenger), while others should be adding this option soon enough. </p>
<p> But, one might ask, what that has to do with the Gboard crashing on Android 11? Well, it seems that users who were using Chat Bubbles run into issues with Gboard as soon as the screen was turned off during the conversation. </p>
<p> So, for the time being, we suggest disabling Chat Bubbles, until Google sorts things out. In order to do so, follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Navigate to Apps & notifications. </p>
<p> Choose Notifications. </p>
<p> Tap Bubbles. </p>
<p> 7. Reset your device to factory settings </p>
<p> Ultimately, if nothing worked, consider resorting to resetting your device to factory settings. In an ideal world, upgrading to a new Android iteration should work flawlessly but that’s, sadly, not always the case. </p>
<p> With that in mind, back up your data to the cloud (Google Drive system backup) or your PC and navigate to Settings > System > Advanced > Reset options > Erase all data. From there, just follow further instructions. </p>
<p> And, on that note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and, in case you have any questions or suggestions, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: Gboard keeps crashing on Android </p>
<p> All the praises to some third-party keyboards, but there are good reasons why the majority of Android users go for the Gboard – the Google Keyboard. Once you set it up, it’s quite intuitive and, more importantly, stable. However, there are users that report certain issues. For some of them, Gboard keeps crashing, sometimes even when it’s not in use. </p>
<p> If you are among affected users, we have a few steps to help you address this without too much effort. </p>
<p> What to do if Gboard keeps stopping? </p>
<p> First of all, reboot your device once. After that, make sure that the problem isn’t in the third-party gesture app that might, accidentally, close Gboard while typing. </p>
<p> If Gboard keeps crashing despite those two steps, move through our list of 4 solutions to fix it for good. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Ensure that Google Gboard is your default keyboard </p>
<p> First of all, make sure that Google Keyboard is your default keyboard. There are many reports about crashes caused by a conflict between the system keyboard (e.g. Samsung Keyboard vs Gboard). That’s why you need to ensure that Gboard is the default keyboard on your device. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to set Google Keyboard as the default keyboard on your Android device: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Select Languages & input. </p>
<p> Under the Current keyboard, select Gboard. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear cache and data </p>
<p> The next step is to clear the cache and the data from the Gboard. Namely, there’s a slight chance that the locally-stored files are causing issues with Gboard. To circumvent that possibility and reset Gboard, you should clear both cache and data. </p>
<p> Here’s how to clear cache and data from Gboard on Android: </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Select All apps (Manage apps or App manager). </p>
<p> Open Gboard. </p>
<p> Clear cache first and then clear data. Have in mind that this will reset Gboard settings. </p>
<p> Restart your phone or tablet. </p>
<p> If the Gboard keeps crashing, move to the next step. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reinstall Gboard or uninstall updates </p>
<p> In case the previous steps failed to resolve the problem, you can try and reinstall the app. If your device came with the pre-installed Gboard as the system keyboard, you can at least uninstall updates, restart your device, and allow Gboard to update again to the latest version. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Select All apps (Manage apps or App manager). </p>
<p> Tap Advanced > App Details. It’ll take you to Gboard’s Play Store page/ </p>
<p> Uninstall the app. </p>
<p> Install the app again from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> If Gboard comes with the system, navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Gboard and uninstall updates there. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Enroll in the Gboard Beta program or install older APK </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps resolved the problem with repetitive Gboard crashes, we have two more things to recommend. </p>
<p> The first one is to navigate to Gboard on the Play Store and enroll in the Beta program. Many users who are beta testers for the app claim that it is, believe it or not, frequently more stable than the public version. I personally do have a Beta version and have never run into any issues. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can navigate to APK Mirror, here, or any other APK hub that aggregates APKs for sideloading. Once there, download and install (sideload) an older version of Gboard. After that, the app shouldn’t keep crashing anymore. </p>
<p> With that said, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and, in case you have any questions or suggestions (possibly alternative solutions), make sure to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> I have resolved the Gboard problem for Android 7.0 tablet by taking wired keyboard, adding OTG (On The Go cable, has micro USB on one end to connect to tablet and USB-A female to connect to keybord’s wire on other end). So that on external keyboard I could enter the password to unlock tablet’s screen. </p>

<p> How to get coordinates from Google Maps in Android </p>
<p> Google Maps is the most advanced mapping system today. As such, it ‘knows of’ any location or property (business or private) in the world. The best thing about it is that you don’t even have to know the address of the place you’re looking for. Just enter the name of that fancy new restaurant, and chances are Google Maps will show you exactly where to go. </p>
<p> Sure, entering the property’s name is the standard way of navigating Google Maps. However, you can get even greater precision with coordinates. Imagine going to a fast food restaurant with a few franchises in the city. If you search by name, you might choose the wrong one. But coordinates will show you the exact location of the spot. That way, you can share it with your friends, for example, and there won’t be any confusion. </p>
<p> Getting coordinates in Google Maps is as easy as it gets, and here’s how you do it… </p>
<p> How to get longitude and latitude in Google Maps for Android </p>
<p> Getting the coordinates for literally any location requires a single tap. All you have to do is find a location you want to get the coordinates of on the map, and long press it with your finger. The pin will appear on the map, along with the coordinates in the search bar. </p>
<p> Keep in mind to long-press the spot on the map. If you just tap it, and the location is already marked (city, restaurant, stadium,etc.), you’ll just see its name, instead of the coordinates. </p>
<p> Speaking of which, if you long-press a ‘claimed’ location, the app will also show the name of the place at these coordinates and offer you directions. </p>
<p> How to share coordinates from Google Maps </p>
<p> Sharing coordinates is also as easy as it gets. When you select the place, the Share button will appear at the bottom of the screen. Just tap it, select the sharing method, select the recipient, and that’s it. When the person you shared the coordinates with opens the link, it’ll automatically switch to Google Maps, pinpointing to the select location. </p>
<p> That’s about it. As you can see, getting and sharing coordinates with Google Maps just can’t be simpler. You don’t even need to know anything about the coordinate system to get this to work. And since this is not a geography lesson, I won’t dive into explaining. Because there are people who will do that much better than me. For example, start with Wikipedia (ugh if you trust it ugh). </p>

<p> How to get IMEI on Android 10 </p>
<p> IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number allows your device to be tracked in case it gets stolen or lost. Also, it definitely comes in handy if you are buying a used (or refurbished) smartphone (shipped from abroad) to check for its seller’s legitimacy. </p>
<p> Besides that, and with a lot of similar (basically same and barely distinguishable) devices coming from China, you’ll probably want the Global version of the device unless you are in China (e.g. Mi 9T Pro instead of Redmi K20 Pro). The originality and legitimacy of these devices can be checked with IMEI, as well. </p>
<p> Learn how to get IMEI on Android 10 with two methods we provided below. </p>
<p> How do I get my device IMEI on Android 10 </p>
<p> Method 1: Use dialer shortcut </p>
<p> The first method is to use the dialer code which, when dialed, will show your IMEI number on Android 10. The code is usually universal, but there might be a few differences for some OEMs. If that’s the case for your device, go to the second method or Google IMEI for your particular OEM/device. </p>
<p> Just open the stock Dialer app (third-party dialer apps won’t work) and type *#06# and dial it. In case you have a dual-SIM device, you’ll see two numbers for each SIM card. </p>
<p> Method 2: Check IMEI in Settings </p>
<p> For the second method, you can navigate to Settings > About phone (or My phone > All specs > Status). Once there, just scroll to the bottom to get IMEI on Android 10. </p>
<p> But what to do with IMEI once you have it? Write it down just in case. This can be used by the police to track your device. Also, you can navigate to IMEI Info, here, or similar websites, put 15 IMEI numbers in, and confirm that you got what you paid for. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and we hope this article helped you learn something new. Don’t forget to share your thoughts in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/gmail-android-not-syncing" parent_folder="web1" id="file17843129" filename="gmail-android-not-syncing">
<p> Fix: Gmail for Android not syncing </p>
<p> Gmail is one of the most important Google services. Despite all the social networks around, many people still use mail as their main mean of communication. That’s why we treat it as a part of the phone and often forget it’s a standalone app. Well, until some problems arise. </p>
<p> One of the most common Gmail problems is the syncing issue. And I assume you’re experiencing this problem right now, as you’re reading this article. So, check out the following solutions, and I hope you’ll resolve the problem. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Update the Gmail app </p>
<p> Although not necessarily a solution to the syncing problem, keeping the Gmail app (and all other apps) up to date is essential for it to work flawlessly. And who knows, maybe there’s some interference inside the app’s code that will be resolved with an update. </p>
<p> So, head over to the Google Play Store and update Gmail. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check the servers </p>
<p> Gmail uses Google’s servers to deliver new emails to your Inbox. So, if the server is down, naturally, you won’t receive the new mail. Before moving on to other solutions, check the G Suite server status. If you find out that the server is down, don’t worry, because Google will probably fix the problem soon. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear the app’s data </p>
<p> And now, on to your favorite solution. I know clearing the app cache and data has become an unpopular solution because of its cliché status, but it may be helpful after all. </p>
<p> Here’s how to clear Gmail’s app data and cache in Android: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Apps or Apps Manager (depending on your phone). If you can’t find it, simply search for installed apps in the Settings search bar. </p>
<p> Locate Gmail in the Apps Manager (if you can’t find it, choose Show all apps or Show system services from additional settings). </p>
<p> Tap Gmail and choose Clear cache. If clearing the cache doesn’t resolve the syncing problem, repeat the procedure, but this time choose Clear data. </p>
<p> Just keep in mind that clearing the app’s data will erase everything, so you’ll have to set up Gmail on your phone once again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check your settings </p>
<p> There are numerous settings that may interfere with the Gmail app, thus preventing it from receiving new emails or syncing. So, you’ll need to tweak these settings to make Gmail function again. </p>
<p> The ones most likely to cause trouble are Airplane mode and Data Saver. Here’s what you need to do with these features to prevent them from blocking Gmail: </p>
<p> 1. Turn off the airplane mode </p>
<p> As you probably know, airplane mode drastically restricts the level of communication your device can establish. Meaning there are no calls or the internet connection in the airplane mode. </p>
<p> Sure, you won’t have this mode enabled all the time, but as it’s most commonly placed in the top settings panel, accidental taps may occur. So, disable airplane mode and check Gmail once again. </p>
<p> 2. Check the data saver settings </p>
<p> If your phone has the data saving feature, it will limit the performance of almost every app when you’re not connected to WiFi. There are two solutions in this case. You can either whitelist Gmail in data saver, or only receive new emails when you’re connected to WiFi. </p>
<p> Sure, whitelisting Gmail will eat up more data, but Gmail itself is not a data-hungry app, so you won’t have to worry about it. Just make sure not to open any media-heavy emails. </p>
<p> Here’s how to whitelist Gmail in Data saver: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Network & Internet > Data usage > Data saver (this step may differ on your phone). </p>
<p> Tap Unrestricted data. </p>
<p> Find Gmail and toggle it on. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Check the internet connection </p>
<p> Obviously, if you’re not properly connected to the internet, Gmail won’t work. So, make sure you don’t have any internet connection problems. </p>
<p> If you notice a certain problem, check out this article for additional solutions. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Enable automatic sync </p>
<p> The automatic sync feature should be enabled by default. But if none of the previous solutions resolved the problem, check this option, as well. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Open Gmail. </p>
<p> Tap the menu button in the upper left corner. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > account (your email address). </p>
<p> Make sure the Sync Gmail option is enabled. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the Gmail syncing problem on your Android phone. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, just write them down in the comments below. </p>

<p> None of the solutions above work. This includes uninstalling and reinstalling the app. </p>

<p> Fix: Gmail keeps crashing on Android </p>
<p> Gmail is easily the most used mail client on Android. Mostly because it comes with the OS and the fact that once-great Inbox is no more. Many people dislike it, as the app is not as intuitive as some other clients. To add insult to injury, it seems that Gmail keeps crashing for some Android users. </p>
<p> Why does my Gmail app keep crashing? </p>
<p> There are various reasons why the Gmail app might keep crashing repeatedly on Android. The most common reasons are the corruption of locally stored cache and a variety of bugs. One of the common reasons is the Dark theme. </p>
<p> In order to fix this, make sure to follow the steps we listed below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear cache and data from the Gmail app </p>
<p> The first step you should take to address the issue at hand is to clear cache and data from the Gmail app. Pilled up locally-stored data might cause this issue. Especially if the app is unstable to start with due to a bug. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from Gmail for Android: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Gmail again. </p>
<p> Select Storage. </p>
<p> Clear the cache first and then clear the data. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Disable and re-enable the app </p>
<p> If the Gmail app keeps crashing, you can try to reinstall the app or, if it’s a system app, disable it and re-enable it again. Most users who run into issues with Gmail for Android fixed the problem this way. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reinstall or disable/re-enable Gmail for Android and prevent further crashes: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Gmail. </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall or Uninstall updates. </p>
<p> Now, open the Play Store and locate Gmail. </p>
<p> Install Gmail and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Sign out of your Google Account and sign in again </p>
<p> This solution might look like a long shot but it seemingly works for some. What you need to do is sign-out of your Android account and then sign in again. This, in combination with previous troubleshooting steps, should address the problem. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to sign out and then sign back into your Google Account on Android: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select Accounts & sync. </p>
<p> Select Google. </p>
<p> Tap on the menu at the bottom and remove the account. </p>
<p> Reboot your device, add the account and check for improvements with Gmail notifications. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Disable Dark mode </p>
<p> One frequent and well-documented reason for this occurrence is the dark mode for Gmail on Android. Namely, after Android 10 was introduced, Google made sure to provide the dark theme for the majority of its apps for Android. When the long-awaited dark them for Gmail was introduced, many users reported crashes. </p>
<p> Now, Google removed the dark theme temporarily and added it again after it was fixed, but we can’t say with certainty whether this feature is definitely stable on all those Android devices. It is currently exclusively available on Android 10. </p>
<p> So, we recommend disabling the dark theme and looking for improvements: </p>
<p> Tap on the hamburger menu and then open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose General settings. </p>
<p> Tap on Theme and select Light. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Update the app </p>
<p> Finally, this is more of a reminder and a continuation of the previous step. Always make sure to keep your apps up to date. You can open Play Store > hamburger menu > My apps & games. Once there, make sure to update all pending apps. </p>
<p> And, on that note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and we certainly hope the here-provided steps helped you resolve the issue. If your Gmail still keeps on crashing, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: Gmail notifications not working on Android </p>
<p> Imagine having an email client that doesn’t notify you about received messages? Yep, that’s what some Gmail users on Android experienced recently. If you are among the affected group and Gmail notifications are not working for you, make sure to check the solutions we listed below. </p>
<p> Why am I not getting Gmail notifications on my phone? </p>
<p> There are various reasons why Gmail notifications are not working on your Android smartphone. Starting with a system bug (or Gmail bug) that some Samsung users run into. </p>
<p> Moving on, notifications might be disabled in the app or the system optimization measures are forcibly preventing Gmail from working in the background. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check in-app notification settings and system settings </p>
<p> Let’s start by thoroughly inspecting both system and in-app notification settings. There are small chances that certain alerts are disabled by mistake or by a system bug. Additionally, ensure that the DND (Do Not Disturb) is disabled. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to check notification settings for Gmail: </p>
<p> Tap on the hamburger menu and then open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose General settings. </p>
<p> Open Mail under your Gmail address and make sure that notifications are enabled. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and check for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Whitelist Gmail from system optimization </p>
<p> The battery life/SoT race has led many OEMs to create quite annoying system utilities that tend to kill background apps. </p>
<p> This comes with the intention to make everything smoother while saving some battery juice, especially when idle. However, these utilities tend to kill some important apps and thus prevent important push notifications from coming through. </p>
<p> The procedure might differ based on your device (Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi all have this background optimization built-in). </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Check the Time </p>
<p> Another important thing is to ensure that your time and date are properly set. The best way to do so is by using the automatic time zone settings, based on your geo-location. This should prevent issues with certain apps. </p>
<p> Here’s how to enable Automatic time on Android: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Open Date & time. </p>
<p> Ensure that “Use network-provided time” and “Use network-provided time zone” are enabled. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Grant necessary permissions to Gmail </p>
<p> Moving on, you can try and set Gmail as the default app and ensure that it autostarts. This is usually far from being a necessity for an email client to work on Android. </p>
<p> However, we read a bunch of reports from Samsung Galaxy S10 users that had issues with Gmail. For some, tweaking permissions and using Gmail as the default client helped. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to check permissions for Gmail: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps and then select App manager, Manage apps, or All apps (depends on device’s manufacturer). </p>
<p> Locate and open Gmail. </p>
<p> Choose Permissions. </p>
<p> Grant all necessary permissions. </p>
<p> Now, get back to the list of all apps, tap on the 3-dot menu and open Default apps. </p>
<p> Set Gmail as the default email app. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Enable Sync </p>
<p> This might sound like a shot-in-the-dark kind of solution but craziest things happened by mistake. Namely, if Gmail Sync is erroneously disabled, now emails won’t come through to you. </p>
<p> This doesn’t apply exclusively to Gmail notifications not working, but it’s still an essential troubleshooting step worth following. </p>
<p> Here’s where to check whether Gmail Sync is enabled: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Accounts & sync. </p>
<p> Ensure that Auto-sync data is enabled. </p>
<p> Then select Google. </p>
<p> Locate Gmail and ensure that sync for Gmail is indeed enabled. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Clear cache and data from Gmail </p>
<p> Another thing you can do is clearing cache and data which will reset the app. If you have any non-Gmail address linked to the Gmail account, you’ll need to set them up again after this procedure. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from Gmail on Android: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Gmail again. </p>
<p> Select Storage. </p>
<p> Clear the cache first and then clear the data. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Update the app and device firmware </p>
<p> Moving forward, make sure that your Gmail app is up to date. Also, do the same for your handset firmware. When the issue massively occurred for hundreds of Samsung users, the problem was addressed with a patch. </p>
<p> Both OS and respective apps should update automatically by default. However, you can check for updates manually by following these instructions: </p>
<p> Open the Google Play Store and search for Gmail. </p>
<p> If there’s an update available, install it. </p>
<p> Now, open Settings > System. </p>
<p> Check for system updates and install them, too. </p>
<p> Solution 8 – Sign out of your Google account and sign in again </p>
<p> Finally, you can try and remove your Google account and add it again. That way, a possible Gmail halt might stop occurring and your push notifications should come through. Just make sure to back up your data before logging out. </p>
<p> Here’s how to remove Google account and add it again: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select Accounts & sync. </p>
<p> Select Google. </p>
<p> Tap on the menu at the bottom and remove the account. </p>
<p> Reboot your device, add the account and check for improvements with Gmail notifications. </p>
<p> With that said, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and we certainly hope one of these solutions helped you with Gmail notifications not working. If you have anything to add or take, do so in the comments section below. We look forward to your feedback. </p>

<p> This is the only thing that worked for me regarding not getting gmail notifications for a new email on my android . After doing all the other obvious stuff to make sure you are going to get notifications, you have to change the setting for syncing the labels. For some unknown reason, the default doesn’t set them all be synched. </p>
<p> For my google pixel 3– </p>
<p> 1) Go to Settings 2) Go to the Gmail address in question 3) Go to Manage Labels 4) Change any that are not synched to sync ‘Last 30 days.’ </p>
<p> Did not work. This is what I hate about Androids. They work, they work, they work – and then they don’t work and you have “factory reset” them and spend an entire day rebuilding the phone from scratch. </p>

<p> Fix: Gmail not receiving emails in Android </p>
<p> Gmail’s Android app is nothing more than a mail client. So, there shouldn’t be too much space for potential issues. Its only job is to deliver emails from the server to your phone. But what if it fails to do its only job? What if Gmail stops receiving emails? </p>
<p> Well, in that case, you have a problem that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. If you recently encountered this issue, try some of the following solutions to make Gmail start delivering emails to your Android phone once again. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Update the Gmail app </p>
<p> Gmail for Android is still just an app. And android apps are bug-prone. So, when you stop receiving emails through Gmail, the first precaution you need to take is check for app updates before proceeding with some more drastic measures. </p>
<p> If there’s a problem inside the app’s code, Google will surely address it sooner rather than later, so you should be covered. Just head over to the Play Store, and check for Gmail updates. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check the servers </p>
<p> Gmail uses Google’s servers to deliver new mail to your inbox. Obviously, if the servers are down, you won’t be getting any new emails. Now, this doesn’t happen quite often, and it’s unlikely servers will remain down for an extended period of time. </p>
<p> However, it won’t hurt if you check the server status, just to be sure. If the problem was indeed caused by a server outage, just wait some time until Google fixes it, and you’ll start receiving emails again. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear the app’s data </p>
<p> Now, let’s move to the oldest trick in the book (well, as old as updating the app). Whenever you have a problem with any Android app, clearing the app cache or data is a potential solution. </p>
<p> So, why not give it a shot here, as well? Here’s how to clear Gmail’s cache and data in Android: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Apps or Apps Manager (depending on your phone). If you can’t find it, simply search for installed apps in the Settings search bar. </p>
<p> Locate Gmail in the Apps Manager (if you can’t find it, choose Show all apps or Show system services from additional settings). </p>
<p> Tap Gmail and choose Clear cache. If clearing the cache doesn’t resolve the syncing problem, repeat the procedure, but this time choose Clear data. Just keep in mind this will erase all your data, and you’ll have to set up the app from scratch. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Enable automatic sync </p>
<p> As you can guess from the feature’s name, it allows you to automatically sync your mail across all your devices. Automatic sync should be enabled by default, but in case it isn’t, let’s check it out: </p>
<p> Open Gmail. </p>
<p> Tap the menu button in the upper left corner. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > account (your email address). </p>
<p> Make sure the Sync Gmail option is enabled. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Check the filters </p>
<p> One of the possible reasons you’re not receiving emails is filters! If your filters are not properly set, they’ll automatically redirect your ‘good’ mail to the Spam folder or some other folder like All Mail. All in all, it doesn’t deliver emails to where it should, and that’s the Inbox folder. </p>
<p> So, you’ll probably want to check the filter settings, and remove all the filters that are blocking the email flow. </p>
<p> You can manage filters in the Android app, so you’ll have to do it in your computer’s browser. Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Keep in mind that deleting filters won’t automatically move existing mail to the Inbox folder, so you’ll have to do that manually. But for the incoming mail, you’re good. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Disable data saver and Airplane mode </p>
<p> Turn off the airplane mode </p>
<p> As you probably know, the airplane mode drastically restricts your phone’s functionality. Especially when it comes to the internet and communications. Since there are no calls or the internet connection in the airplane mode, you obviously won’t be able to receive any emails. </p>
<p> Sure, the airplane mode won’t be enabled all the time, but as it’s usually placed in the top settings panel, accidental taps may occur. So, disable the airplane mode and check Gmail once again. </p>
<p> Check the data saver settings </p>
<p> If your phone has the data saving feature, it will limit the performance of almost any app that requires data. There are two solutions in this case. You can either whitelist Gmail in data saver, or disable the data saving feature. </p>
<p> Sure, whitelisting Gmail will eat up more data, but Gmail itself is not a data-hungry app, so you won’t have to worry about it. Just make sure not to open any media-heavy emails. </p>
<p> Here’s how to whitelist Gmail in Data saver: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Network & Internet > Data usage > Data saver (this step may differ on your phone). </p>
<p> Tap Unrestricted data. </p>
<p> Find Gmail and toggle it on. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Re-sync your account </p>
<p> And finally, if none of the solutions above resolved our issue with Gmail, our last resort is to simply try and re-sync your Gmail account with your phone. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Accounts. </p>
<p> Tap your Gmail account (it’s usually your email address). </p>
<p> Go to Remove account and confirm. </p>
<p> Now, head over to Gmail, you’ll see the “Account sync is off. Turn it on in Account settings” message. Tap the message. </p>
<p> Tap Manage your Google Account > Add account. </p>
<p> Log in to your Google Account again. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I certainly hope at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the problem with Gmail not receiving new emails. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, just let us know in the comments below. </p>
<p> tried everything it still does not sync! I have emails sent 2 hours ago and do not notify me! </p>

<p> Fix: Gmail not sending emails on Android </p>
<p> Gmail as a service might be quite solid but the Gmail app for Android is not everyone’s cup of tea. Since Google discontinued Inbox (which was a fun favorite), Gmail for Android has hardly been a worthy replacement. Especially if there are essential issues like Gmail not sending emails. </p>
<p> If you are unable to receive emails via Gmail, check our article about that, here. On the other hand, if you are unable to send emails as they get stuck in Outbox, follow the steps below. </p>
<p> Why is Gmail not sending my emails? </p>
<p> There are multiple reasons why this would happen. Usually, there’s a temporary server-side issue and your emails will, after some time in Outbox, get sent eventually. However, the problem might lie in the app, connection, or badly configured POP/SMTP server. </p>
<p> Whatever it is, we are sure you are quite annoyed by it. Make sure to follow the troubleshooting steps we listed below in order for Gmail to start sending your emails again. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Double-check recipients and email details </p>
<p> Firstly, and we are here pointing the obvious, but double-check your recipient’s email address and the subject field. Even a small mistake will prevent sending and your email message will be permanently stuck in Outbox. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you are sure that everything is on point, but your Gmail emails still won’t send, continue troubleshooting. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Make sure you’ve configured Gmail server properly </p>
<p> If you are using other email accounts (non-Gmail accounts), make sure that you are properly signed in with your credentials. Furthermore, ensure that POP/SMTP Servers are using appropriate ports. </p>
<p> You can learn more about how to set and configure a third-party email account on the Gmail client, here. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear cache and data </p>
<p> In order to resolve usual issues with third-party apps on Android, the best first step is clearing the locally-stored cache and data. These are stored to keep your files, speed up the loading speeds (so not everything needs to load every time you access an app), and more. </p>
<p> However, after some time, having an abundant cache and data might bring more bad than good, slow down the app, make it fail to initiate or crash. That’s why we recommend clearing cache and data. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from Gmail on Android: </p>
<p> Then open App Manager, All apps, or Manage apps. </p>
<p> Reboot your device, open Gmail again, and try sending emails. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall Gmail </p>
<p> If the previous step fell short, you can try and uninstall Gmail. Of course, some OEMs with their close-to-stock Android experience make Gmail a system app. This means that you are not able to uninstall it but rather uninstall its updates and they’ll install again. </p>
<p> One way or another, it’s worth a try. Follow these steps to reinstall Gmail on your Android handset: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Gmail. </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall or Uninstall updates. </p>
<p> Now, open the Play Store and locate Gmail. </p>
<p> Install Gmail and reboot your device. </p>
<p> You’ll be signed in automatically so check for improvements in regards to email-sending issues. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Remove the Google Account and add it again </p>
<p> Finally, you can try to start with a clean slate — remove your Google Account and add it again. This way, Gmail and other Google services on your device will reset. The procedure is simple and you won’t lose anything as everything is cloud-based. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to remove the Google Account from your device and add it again: </p>
<p> Choose Accounts. </p>
<p> Select Google. </p>
<p> Tap More and remove the Google account. </p>
<p> This is the last thing we can suggest. If the problem persists, make sure to reach out to Google support and ask for resolution. </p>
<p> Just have in mind that Gmail, like many of Google’s platforms, is an object of constant change. Changes that are supposed to make things better but bring a lot of isolated or even public issues to end-users. </p>
<p> With that, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and make sure to tell us about your issues with Gmail or possible solutions that we forgot to mention. You can do so in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: Google app not working on Android </p>
<p> It’s hard to imagine any Android device without the Google app and all things coming with it, including ever-expanding Assistant, Podcasts, Feed, and more. However, due to frequent updates and changes, the app itself is often ridden with bugs. Now, this might depend on the OS version and other factors, but many users reported that the Google app is not working on Android. </p>
<p> Not to worry, we got your back. Check the steps below and resolve the problem in no time. </p>
<p> Google app not working on Android? Here’s a fix </p>
<p> There are various reasons why Google App won’t work on Android. Starting with cache corruption and a temporary bug, and leading to Google Play Services issues. </p>
<p> Have in mind that the steps we listed below apply only to stock ROMs. It’s not unusual for Gapps (Google Apps in Android OS) to fail on custom ROMs. If that’s the case, we suggest reinstalling (flashing) Gapps. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear cache and data from the Google app </p>
<p> Let us start with troubleshooting by clearing cache and data from the Google app. There might be corruption at hand and, considering Google piles up a lot of data locally, it’s not unusual for the app to execute as intended. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from the Google app on Android: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Then, open App manager, Manage apps, or All apps (it depends on the phone’s OEM). </p>
<p> Now, locate and open Google from the list of apps. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Finally, clear cache and then tap Manage space and clear all data. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Uninstall updates and update the app </p>
<p> If the previous step failed to address the problem and the Google app is still not working on your Android device, let’s try with the reinstallation. Now, since the Google app is pre-installed on every device (sorry, Huawei), as an integral part of the OS, it can’t be uninstalled. </p>
<p> What you can do is reset it, remove all updates and update it again. That usually deals with all hickups users regularly run into. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset (reinstall) the Google app on Android: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for and expand Google. </p>
<p> Uninstall Google (this will uninstall updates since the Google app is a system app). </p>
<p> Reboot your device and update the app. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Leave the Google Beta program </p>
<p> If you like to be an early adopter of the latest additions to the Google app (this includes Google Assistant and Google Feed), you probably enrolled in the Beta program. And, truth to be told, Beta releases are usually as stable as public updates. </p>
<p> However, to tackle this problem from all sides, try leaving the Beta program. Follow these steps to leave the Beta program for the Google app: </p>
<p> Scroll down and, under the You’re a beta tester section, tap Leave. </p>
<p> Wait until you are excluded from the Beta program and update the app. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reset Google Play Services </p>
<p> One more thing worth inspecting that’s related to the Google app is Google Play Services. This system component provides core functionality and it’s essential for stable work of all Google services on an Android handset. </p>
<p> Therefore, you can try and clear cache from the Google Play Services app, as well. This might help address issues with the Google app. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset Google Play Services: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Then, open App manager, Manage apps, or All apps (it depends on the phone’s OEM). </p>
<p> Once there, tap on the 3-dot menu and enable all system processes. This will add hidden system apps and services to the App list. </p>
<p> Now, locate Google Play Services entry and open it. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Finally, clear cache and data. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Check the permissions </p>
<p> Additionally, and despite Google apps usually take all necessary permissions from the get-go, it’s suggested to check permissions for the app. We suggest inspecting permissions and granting them all, just for the sake of troubleshooting. You can disable certain permissions later. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to check permissions for the Google app: </p>
<p> Select All apps (App manager or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Open Google again. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Sign out of Google Account and sign in again </p>
<p> Another thing you can try is signing out of your Google account assigned to your device and signing in again. This is a long-shot solution but it might help. It did help some users with similar issues so it’s worth a try. </p>
<p> Here’s how to sign out of your Google Account on Android and sign in again: </p>
<p> Select Google. </p>
<p> Tap More and remove the Google account. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Install an older version via an APK </p>
<p> Finally, you can try and downgrade the Google app with an APK downloaded from a third-party website and sideloaded on your device. Have in mind that Google might insist on updating the app, so you should also navigate to Google app in the Play Store and disable Auto-updates. </p>
<p> Here’s how and where to get an older version of the Google app: </p>
<p> Uninstall Google app updates as explained above. </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror, here, or any other APK hub online. </p>
<p> Download an older APK version but not older than two months. </p>
<p> Grant permission to install apps from untrusted sources. </p>
<p> Install the APK and give it a go. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to tell us if the instructions we presented helped you resolve the problem. You can do so in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Translate speech in real-time with Google’s Interpreter Mode </p>
<p> Google recently released its Interpreter Mode on both Android and iOS. In case you’re not familiar with this feature, it allows you to translate words, sentences or even whole conversations just by talking to your phone. Interpreter Mode is, of course, powered by Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Interpreter Mode made its debut in January, during this year’s CES event, and was originally only available on smart displays, like the Google Nest Hub. </p>
<p> As most people will probably use this feature to communicate with locals while on vacation, you’d agree that it only being available on smart speakers was not at all convenient. So, Google finally decided to do this feature justice and bring it to mobile devices. </p>
<p> The introduction of this feature marks another milestone on Google’s continuous journey of improving its translation services, and more importantly its already extremely smart Google Assistant. Only this time, it’s a crossover in form of Interpreter Mode. </p>
<p> How to use Interpreter to translate conversations in real-time </p>
<p> A great thing about Interpreter Mode is that it’s integrated with Google Assistant. Which means you don’t have to install an app to use it. The only requirement is the properly configured Assistant. </p>
<p> To activate Interpreter Mode, just initiate Google Assistant and say a command like “Be my Italian interpreter” or “Help me speak Japanese”, and you’ll enter Interpreter Mode. Once you’re there, the Assistant will automatically translate your speech to a chosen language and read it out loud. </p>
<p> But that’s not all, Interpreter Mode works both ways. So, you can actually have a conversation with someone, and it will translate both of your speeches, as there’s no need to switch languages manually. </p>
<p> Right now, Interpreter Mode is compatible with 44 different languages (full list here). But with Google database’s constant growth, it shouldn’t be for too long before the feature becomes available in even more languages. </p>
<p> Instant translation has been one of the most desirable features for many travelers, and now it’s available on your Android phone. Combine it with Lens and Maps, and it will be very hard for you to get lost in a foreign city, no matter how far from home you are. </p>

<p> The majority of reported cases suggests that the problem occurs mostly on headphones. Users are listening to music, podcasts, or something third and the Google Assistant just pops-up with that annoying sound, stopping the playback. </p>
<p> This usually happens when they press and hold the Play/Pause button on the headphones. Which, by default, should trigger Google Assistant. Of course, it depends on what kind of headphones you use, but those are, in general, global settings. </p>
<p> Now, the first and simplest solution is to prevent Google Assistant triggers on both wired and wireless headphones. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Google. </p>
<p> Select Account services and then Search, Assistant, & Voice. </p>
<p> Tap on Voice and disable Bluetooth audio recording, Allow Bluetooth requests with device locked, and Allow wired headset requests with device locked. </p>
<p> Restart your device and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Disable Voice trigger for the Google Assistant </p>
<p> If the problem is global and Google Assistant is popping up without you summoning it, the next thing we can do is disabling the Voice trigger. That way, it won’t be summoned by voice (or at least it shouldn’t). </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to disable Voice match > Hey Google on your device: </p>
<p> Navigate again to Settings > Google > Account services > Search, Assistant, & Voice. </p>
<p> Open Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Select the Assistant tab. </p>
<p> Scroll down and tap Phone. </p>
<p> Toggle off the Hey Google option. </p>
<p> Just to be sure, get back to Search, Assistant, & Voice section. </p>
<p> Select Voice and then Voice Match. </p>
<p> Toggle off the Hey Google option if available. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Turn off Google Assistant completely </p>
<p> In case even that doesn’t prevent nasty intrusive pop-ups, you can completely disable the Assistant on your handset. Re-enabling it is simple if you want it back but, considering how much trouble is causing to some users, that’s not highly probable. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to disable Google Assistant entirely: </p>
<p> Navigate again to Settings > Google > Account services > Search, Assistant, & Voice. </p>
<p> Open Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Select the Assistant tab. </p>
<p> Scroll down and tap Phone. </p>
<p> Toggle off the Google Assistant option. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Revoke permissions and voice access to Google Assistant </p>
<p> Finally, if you are still, after all these previous steps, unable to abolish Google Assistant from your device, make sure to revoke all permissions from Google and disable Voice Access in Default apps settings. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > App manager or All apps > Google. </p>
<p> Revoke Microphone permission under Permissions for the Google app. </p>
<p> Now, get back to the list of all apps and tap on the 3-dot menu. </p>
<p> Select Default apps. </p>
<p> Scroll to the bottom and open Voice assistant. </p>
<p> Under both Wake with button shortcuts and Wake with Bluetooth audio select anything else but Google. </p>
<p> Open Assist & voice input. </p>
<p> Open Assist app. </p>
<p> Select None and exit Settings. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and make sure to tell us if the aforementioned steps helped you address the problem in the comments section below. </p>

<p> You can go to default programs and pick a different assistant since Samsung has a competing product in Bixby. </p>
<p> The nice thing about that is you can choose “none” which stops all of it. </p>

<p> Haven’t tried the last(disabling access), but the first options didn’t help me. I use earbuds when riding my bike and it’s not easy to keep turning it off, rebooting, etc. Now that I’ve learned from others it’s about headphones I’m going to just try and play music/etc with no headphones. It didn’t use to have this behavior, but it is every time I use the headphones lately. </p>

<p> I have tried all of the above, nothing works. My headphones have a microphone and Google Assistant continuously pops up even after I have removed turned off everything and restarted my phone. I’m using my a Nokia 6.1. It’s like Google is forcing Google assist on us. This has been occurring since I downloaded the latest Android software update. </p>

<p> Toggling off doesn’t work, will try the second method to try to stop Google assistant from popping up. I even have a pop up blocker and that doesn’t work. In fact it has popped up 3 times since typing this. </p>

<p> Fix: Google Assistant is not available on this device </p>
<p> Google Assistant is probably the best AI-powered digital voice assistant out there. And with the largest market share due to obvious reasons (every Android 5+ device has it). However, some users reported a certain error informing them that Google Assistant is not available on this device. If you are among them, you can find the swift solution below. </p>
<p> Why is Google Assistant not available on my device? </p>
<p> There are multiple reasons why users are getting this error when trying to use Google Assistant on their Android devices. Of course, there are some limitations considering device specs and overall Google Services support. </p>
<p> Here are the system requirements for Google Assistant: </p>
<p> Android 5.0+ with at least 1.0GB of available memory or </p>
<p> Android 6.0+ with at least 1.5GB of available memory </p>
<p> Also, if you are using a custom ROM (or Chines ROM) with sideloaded Google Play services, sometimes the Assistant won’t work. So, the steps below only apply to stock official ROMs. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Make sure Google Assistant is enabled </p>
<p> Firstly, go and reboot your device once. There might be a temporary halt at hand and it gets resolved after restarting the device. If that doesn’t help, make sure that Google Assistant is enabled in the first place. </p>
<p> Most of the time, Google Assistant initializes and configures during the first startup. However, if you refused some of the license terms by accident, Google Assistant won’t work. </p>
<p> So, here’s how to enable Google Assistant on your device: </p>
<p> Open Google Assistant from the Home screen. </p>
<p> Tap on the Account icon in the top right corner. </p>
<p> Choose the Assistant tab. </p>
<p> Scroll down and select Phone. </p>
<p> Make sure that both Google Assistant and Hey Google options are enabled. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and give voice commands another go. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Disable Bixby or alternative assistants </p>
<p> If you are using a Samsung handset, we recommend disabling Bixby and selecting Google Assistant as the default option. This way, you’ll not only resolve possible issues but also get the extra physical trigger button to use with Google Assistant instead of sub-par Bixby. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to disable Bixby on your device: </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Home screen until the launcher menu appears. </p>
<p> Swipe right on the bottom to reach the -1 Bixby screen. </p>
<p> Toggle the Bixby screen off. </p>
<p> Now, from the Quick actions area, tap on the Power icon. </p>
<p> Open Side key settings. </p>
<p> Make sure that Bixby is not set under both Double-press and Press and hold sections. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Check Default app settings </p>
<p> Another thing you should check in local settings are settings for the default Voice assistant and Assist & voice input. Both options should be set to Google in order for Google Assistant to work as intended. </p>
<p> With that in mind, here’s where to find and change the aforementioned settings on your Android device: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Open All apps (Manage apps or Apps Manager). </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and open Default apps. </p>
<p> Under the Voice assistant and Assist & voice input sections, set Google as the preferred service. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Clear cache and data from the Google app </p>
<p> If you are still stuck with the same error and the prompt is saying that Google Assistant is not available on your device, we suggest clearing the cache and data from the Google app and configuring everything from scratch. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from the Google app: </p>
<p> Select All apps (App manager or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Open Google. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Uninstall updates from the Google app </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can uninstall updates from the Google app and reset the app completely. Since the Google app is a pre-installed system app on the majority of Android devices, you won’t be able to remove it completely. What you can do is uninstall updates (reset it to stock version) and update it again. Hopefully, this will resolve the bug. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to uninstall updates from the Google app on Android: </p>
<p> Navigate yet again to the Google app via Settings > Apps. </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall updates. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and update the Google app from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Leave Beta program </p>
<p> Finally, if you are a part of the Beta program for the Google app, we suggest leaving it. Although Beta releases are fairly stable, they are not as stable as the public ones. There might be a bug at hand causing the “Google Assistant is not available on this device” error. </p>
<p> You can leave the Beta program for the Google app within the Google Play Store. Just look for the Google app, scroll down, and tap Leave under the “You’re a beta tester” section. </p>
<p> You can also reset the device to factory settings, although we can’t say with certainty that this will help. </p>
<p> And, on that note, we can wrap this article. Thank you for reading and, in case you have any questions or suggestions, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-assistant-not-responding" parent_folder="web1" id="file17842434" filename="google-assistant-not-responding">
<p> Fix: Google Assistant not responding </p>
<p> Google Assistant is, in many aspects, the best personal assistant out there and the fact that’s available on every post-Android 6.0 smartphone heavily works in its favor. The best thing about it is the voice access, however, many users state that Google Assistant is not responding after the trigger word on their devices. </p>
<p> What to do when Google Assistant is not working? </p>
<p> There are more than a few ways to tackle this problem. Make sure that your device runs on Android 6+ and has Google app above version 6. If you meet those requirements, try restarting your device. Additionally, you can leave the Beta Program if you have enrolled and stick to the public releases. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t help, continue with the troubleshooting by following the steps we provided for you below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Make sure that the Voice Match is enabled </p>
<p> In order for Google Assistant to be summoned by voice commands, you’ll need to enable this option first. The Voice match, if previously enrolled, should work by default. However, certain system changes (firmware updates) tend to toggle off this option. </p>
<p> So, here’s how to enable Voice match on your device: </p>
<p> Open Google Assistant from the Home screen. </p>
<p> Tap on the Account icon in the top right corner. </p>
<p> Choose the Assistant tab. </p>
<p> Scroll down and select Phone. </p>
<p> Make sure that both Google Assistant and Hey Google options are enabled. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and give voice commands another go. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Retrain the Voice model </p>
<p> Moving on, we might be looking at a bug and the next step to take is to retrain your voice match. Based on many reports by users, retraining the voice model is a viable fix for the problem at hand. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to retrain Google Assistant’s Voice model: </p>
<p> Follow the same path as in the previous solution. </p>
<p> On the Assistant settings screen, under the Hey Google option, tap Voice model. </p>
<p> Tap Retrain voice model. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear cache and data from the Google app </p>
<p> Before reinstalling the app, we always recommend clearing cache and data from it. There might be a cache corruption at hand so this should deal with it. Since the majority of settings are stored in the cloud, clearing data won’t relieve you of anything valuable. </p>
<p> Here’s how to clear cache and data from the Google app: </p>
<p> Select All apps (App manager or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Open Google. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and follow through with a fresh setup of the Assistant. </p>
<p> If Google Assistant is still not responding to your voice commands, continue troubleshooting by following the steps below. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check the permissions </p>
<p> Now, the Google app usually has all the necessary permissions granted by default. However, chances are that a system update made certain changes and is preventing access to the microphone. The microphone is, obviously, essential for the voice commands so make sure to check permissions and grant the mic permission again. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to check permissions that the Google app has: </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Select All apps (App manager or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Open Google again. </p>
<p> Make sure that the Microphone permission is granted. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Make Google Assistant your default Assist app </p>
<p> Some OEMs offer alternative built-in smart assistants and there might be a conflict between the two (e.g. Samsung Bixby and Google Assistant). What you need to do in that case is set Google Assistant as your default Assist and Voice app. </p>
<p> This is usually done within the Default apps settings menu. Once you ensured that Google is your default Assist app, the problem with non-responsive Google Assistant should cease to bother you. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Uninstall updates from the Google app </p>
<p> In case the Google Assistant is still not responding to your voice commands, make sure to uninstall updates from the Google app. Or, if possible, uninstall the app completely and then install it from scratch. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to uninstall updates from the Google app: </p>
<p> Navigate yet again to the Google app via Settings > Apps. </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall updates. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and update the Google app from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Reset your device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps worked for you, the only thing we can suggest is resetting your device to factory settings. This is the last resort and we don’t recommend doing it unless it’s absolutely imperative for you to run Google Assistant with voice commands. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and, hopefully, these solutions helped you in resolving issues with Google Assistant. In case you have anything to add or take, feel free to do so in the comments section below. </p>

<p> How to make Google Assistant read aloud web articles </p>
<p> In recent years, Google invested a lot in AI and the biggest recipient of vast improvements definitely is Google Assistant. Many features are still limited to Pixel devices, but they are slowly finding their way to the general public. </p>
<p> One of the features that’s, at the moment, available on Android 5+ devices is the Read aloud. This feature allows Android users to ask Google Assistant to read web articles for them out loud. You can just open an article in Google app or Chrome and ask Google Assistant to read it by saying: “OK, Google, read it” or “OK, Google, read this page”. </p>
<p> After a few tests, we can conclude that this is not your ordinary text-to-speech feature, as the voices are more natural (users can choose between 4 different voices) and it brings a whole player-like menu (like Google Podcasts or Google Books). In addition, it focuses solely on the article, so it won’t read ad banners or something similar. </p>
<p> The aforementioned player allows you to control reading speed and rewind or skip forward. Also, it highlights words as they are read and scrolls down for you. You can turn this off from the 3-dot menu > Text sync. It also has a permanent mini-player in the Notification shade, but this feature might be reserved for Android 10 devices. </p>
<p> You can also translate articles written in a foreign language and, at the moment, this feature supports 42 world languages. It is still in the early stages but the overall functionality is already there. </p>
<p> As we are writing this, we run into a small bug. If you trigger the Assistant with a button or a shortcut from the Home Screen, the Read aloud function won’t work. Also, make sure to enable Screen context in Assistant > Phone settings. </p>
<p> To get this feature immediately (if you don’t have it already), open the Play Store > Google and enroll in the Beta program for the Google app. </p>
<p> With that said, we can wrap it up. Do you see yourself using this feature? Tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: Google Calendar not syncing on Android </p>
<p> Multiplatform reminders are one of the most used options for the users of Android. Especially, if your work demands to organize your time and to keep track of different valuable errands. Both enterprises or personal users can find a lot of use for them. </p>
<p> Google Calendar is one of the most popular solutions for the majority of users, because of its great usability and performance. However, it doesn’t seem to be the case every time. One of the repeating issues is syncing of Google Calendar on Android devices. </p>
<p> ‘‘Until two weeks ago, I had no problem with using my Google calendar on my Samsung Galaxy S6. However, my boss uses a shared calendar to update our schedules, and for two weeks now I am only able to access the updated version on my laptop. My phone continues to show only the oldest calendar. I have tried all of the “help” section suggestions for syncing problems, including clearing my calendar data. Nothing seems to be working. Help, please!” </p>
<p> Sometimes Google Calendar won’t sync at all, sometimes it stops syncing without any special reason. We found some solutions that might be helpful. </p>
<p> Update Google Calendar app </p>
<p> Besides checking your Wi-Fi connection, the main step is updating Google Calendar app. To do so follow this instruction: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Applications or Application manager. </p>
<p> Find Google Calendar app and open it. </p>
<p> Select Update if available. </p>
<p> Unsync Google Calendar app temporarily </p>
<p> Maybe the problem lies in the misfunctioning of the all-around synchronization. This way you can reset it and, possibly make it work again. To do so, follow presented instructions: </p>
<p> Tap Google. </p>
<p> Choose your account. </p>
<p> Follow the same path and check previously unchecked Calendar tab. </p>
<p> Remove and re-establish your Gmail account </p>
<p> You can also try to reset your Gmail account because sometimes the problem occurs with Gmail synchronization. To do that, follow the instruction below: </p>
<p> Tap Accounts. </p>
<p> Select Google. </p>
<p> Choose your account. </p>
<p> Follow the same path and sign again with your Gmail account. </p>
<p> Enable Calendar Storage </p>
<p> If this option is disabled, Google Calendar won’t sync or show any events. So, be sure it is enabled. To enable Calendar Storage, follow the instructions: </p>
<p> In the top right corner tap More </p>
<p> Open Show System </p>
<p> Clear Google Calendar data </p>
<p> Clearing Google Calendar data may help you with re-establishing synchronization. However, have in mind that this may erase some unsynced data. To Clear Google Calendar data, follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps or Application manager. </p>
<p> In list of the apps installed, select Google Calendar </p>
<p> Tap Clear Data and confirm. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Stop any other app that uses connection </p>
<p> Many users found the social apps as one of the sources of the problem. These apps use a lot of system resources while maintaining background connection as well. This can create a problem for both syncing or auto-updating apps. To stop the apps from working in the background, do as follows: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps or Application manager. </p>
<p> Select preferred app. </p>
<p> Choose Force Stop. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings </p>
<p> Last resort in any problem related to Android is factory settings reset. Some of the issues tend to stack up over time. To do the factory reset, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup and Reset. </p>
<p> Backup your settings and data to Google servers via Google account. </p>
<p> Select Factory Data Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Device. </p>
<p> Choose Erase Everything. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this fix-list satisfying and helpful. Do you have any other solutions for the Google Calendar syncing problem? Please tell us in the comments. </p>

<p> Yes, this is a little LONG, but I hope it helps when trying to sync pre-installed calendar apps with Galaxy S series phones. Don’t know if it’ll work w/ all, but it did PERFECTLY w/ mine. I had a Galaxy S3 & it began hanging up during calls & suddenly shutting off for no reason, etc. Had it for abt 5 yrs, so I figured it was time for a “new” phone. I found a Galaxy Stellar (I know, it’s older than the S3) well worth the $$ & covered under my cell contract. I was trying to sync the… Read more » </p>
<p> Use the app Copy My Data. MUST BE INSTALLED ON BOTH DEVICES TO WORK! Copies ALL Calendar info, Contacts, Photos, & 1 other thing (can’t remember) (has a list of the ‘categories’ ie Calendar, w/ a check box beside it). Check the box next to the info you want to copy (it goes MUCH quicker if you copy 1 @ a time). MUCH EASIER & QUICKER THAN ANYTHING ELSE I’VE TRIED! Good luck folks!! </p>

<p> Fix: Google Calendar not working </p>
<p> Google tends to start a bunch of new projects and neglect them, but there are some overall good solutions, including Google’s own calendar. Google Calendar is there for ages and it’s an integral part of the ecosystem. However, many Android users posted about Google Calendar not working on their handsets. </p>
<p> We listed some common applicable solutions for Google Calendar issues below. Continue reading to find out how to tackle a variety of issues this app might run into on Android. </p>
<p> Why is my Google Calendar not loading on Android? </p>
<p> There are various reasons why Google Calendar won’t load, open, or is generally sluggish on Android. The most common reasons are connectivity issues and pilled up cache and data. Although, some server-side issues might occur as well. </p>
<p> Either way, if you have any problems running Google Calendar on Android, make sure to check the steps we provided below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear cache and data from Google Calendar </p>
<p> The first thing you should do is completely clear locally-stored cache and data. Due to the abundance of stored cache, apps might start misbehaving. This step is simple and, since Google Calendar is a cloud-based service, you won’t lose anything. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from Google Calendar: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps (open App Manager, All apps, or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Tap Clear Cache and then tap Clear Data. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Inspect the connection </p>
<p> The next probable culprit for Google Calendar syncing issues is quite an obvious one. The problem is a wireless connection (or lack of it, to be precise) and you can test it inside the app with ease. </p>
<p> Just tap on the 3-dot icon at the top and then tap Refresh. If you get the No connection prompt, double-check your network or try switching to Mobile Data. </p>
<p> Moreover, if you have global issues with a network connection (slow loading speeds in other network-dependent apps), we recommend following these steps in order to troubleshoot it: </p>
<p> Reboot your handset and router/modem. </p>
<p> Disable VPN or proxy. </p>
<p> Enable Airplane mode for a minute or so and then disable it. Look for improvements. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to System > Reset & backup > Reset Network settings. From there, reset Network settings. Have in mind that this will erase all saved SSIDs and Bluetooth pairings. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reinstall Google Calendar </p>
<p> Moving on. If the problem persists and Google Calendar is not working after previous steps, you should reinstall the app. If the Calendar comes pre-installed as a system app, you still can uninstall all updates and then update it again. This should, hopefully, resolve the problem at hand. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reinstall Google Calendar on Android: </p>
<p> Open Settings and then Apps. </p>
<p> Choose All apps, App manager, or Manage apps based on OS skin you are using. </p>
<p> Open Google Calendar and uninstall the app. </p>
<p> Now, navigate to Google Play Store, look for Google Calendar and install it. </p>
<p> Reset your handset and check whether the Calendar is working properly. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Install an older APK of Google Calendar </p>
<p> Now, if the current version of Google Calendar is flawed for some reason, and that’s not exactly unusual for Google’s apps, you can try and install an older version. </p>
<p> There are third-party websites that keep versions of commonly used Android apps, including Google Calendar. Once you download the APK, grant permission, and install it, Google Calendar should work without problems. </p>
<p> We suggest avoiding old versions, so nothing older than 2 months should be used. If a certain app version isn’t working, you can always uninstall it and go for another one. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to install an older APK of Google Calendar: </p>
<p> Open your preferred mobile browser. </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror’s Google Calendar section, here. </p>
<p> Download any APK that’s not too old nor the latest version. </p>
<p> Tap to install it and, when prompted, grant permission to install from third-party sources. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Use the web-based Google Calendar client </p>
<p> Until now, the problem should be resolved. However, if the Google Calendar app just refuses to work, you can access the web-based client. Just open Chrome, tap on the 3-dot menu and check the Desktop site box. After that, just search for Google Calendar. </p>
<p> This might be unrelated, but if you access Google Calendar for the web on your PC and experience issues, make sure to clear browser’s cache or try logging in when in the Incognito mode. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Send user report to Google Support </p>
<p> Finally, if you want to help with identifying problems or provide Google with some constructive feedback, you can do so through the app. Just open the hamburger menu from the Google Calendar and then tap Help & feedback. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thanks for reading and don’t forget to post any questions or suggestions in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: Google Drive keeps crashing on Android </p>
<p> Using Google Drive is mandatory on Android devices, which is probably the biggest reason why this cloud storage solution is usually a go-to service for so many users. However, there are user reports scattered online about Google Drive crashing on Android. </p>
<p> We ensured to provide you with a few applicable solutions for this problem so make sure to continue reading. </p>
<p> Why does Google Drive keep crashing? </p>
<p> Google Drive might keep crashing for a variety of reasons. It can happen either due to a pilled up cache and data stored locally that causes slowdowns. Alternatively, the current version of Google Drive might be buggy or corrupted. </p>
<p> Now, we have to mention that these solutions solely apply to stock ROMs. A lot of Google apps integration is failing on custom ROMs, so have that in mind. If you are on a stock ROM and Google Drive is repetitively crashing, make sure to check the solutions below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear Cache and Data </p>
<p> First of all, close Google Drive from the Recently used apps. After that, we recommend clearing app cache and data. This should resolve certain issues caused by piles of data stored locally on your device. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear Cache and Data on your device: </p>
<p> Open Google Drive from the apps list. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Reinstall the app </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can reinstall the app and move from there. In case Google Drive comes pre-installed as a system app, you can always uninstall updates and move from there. This usually fixes the problem with Google Drive crashing on Android. </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for Drive. </p>
<p> Uninstall the Google Drive app. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Besides the locally stored cache and data, chances are cache partition corruption is causing crashes of apps on your Android. That’s why we suggest wiping cache partition. This operation is safe so you don’t have to worry about losing any data during the procedure. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to wipe the cache partition on your Android device: </p>
<p> ower off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Install an older version via APK </p>
<p> There’s a chance that there’s a certain rare issue with the current version of Google Drive installed on your device. What you can do about it, besides reinstalling the app, is switching to an APK. An APK of the older Google Drive version. </p>
<p> Here’s what you have to do in order to downgrade Google Drive to an older version: </p>
<p> Uninstall Google Drive from your device as previously explained. </p>
<p> Download an older APK (not older than 2 months preferably) and grant permission to install from third-party sources when prompted. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if you tried all the previous recommendations and you are still getting Google Drive crashing repetitively (or any other app for that matter), we recommend performing a system reset to factory settings. </p>
<p> Just have in mind that this procedure will delete all files from the internal storage so ensure to back up everything before proceeding. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reset your Android handset to factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Use Google Drive for the Web </p>
<p> Now, this isn’t a solution per se but more of a workaround. In order to avoid obvious shortcomings of Google Drive for Android, you can use the desktop version on your phone or just use your PC. </p>
<p> Don’t forget to use the incognito mode while accessing Google Drive from the PC browser. This will help you avoid certain issues with add-ons and piled up browser cache. </p>
<p> If you are, on the other hand, determined to use Google Drive on your Android device, there’s a way to trick the system and use the web-based client instead of the app. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to use Google Drive for the Web on your Android: </p>
<p> Open Chrome on your Android device. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and check the Desktop site box. </p>
<p> Navigate to Google Drive. </p>
<p> Download files to your device from there. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this, hopefully, informative piece. Thank you for reading and make sure to tell us whether these steps helped you or not in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-drive-download-not-working" parent_folder="web1" id="file17849408" filename="google-drive-download-not-working">
<p> Fix: Google Drive download not working </p>
<p> Google Drive is a go-to cloud storage solution for millions of users around the world. It supports the Offline mode that allows you to access files locally or you can always download them to your Android device. However, some users report that Google Drive download is not working at all. </p>
<p> If you are unable to download files from Google Drive after multiple tries, check the solutions we provided for you below. </p>
<p> Why can’t I download Google Drive files? </p>
<p> There are more than a few reasons why Google Drive won’t download files. Starting with connectivity issues. There might be a temporary problem on the server-side or, if you are trying to access other people’s shared files, chances are you don’t have necessary download permissions. </p>
<p> Ensure you have enough storage space and permission to download the file. If you meet those requirements and Google Drive has permission to access Storage, the next thing is to wait some time because Google Drive might be down temporarily. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if Google Drive download is still not working, use the troubleshooting steps below to fix it. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear cache and data from the app </p>
<p> The first thing that you can go for is clearing cache and data from the Google Drive app. Due to crammed data, chances are the app is not functioning as intended. This is quite a common reason for a variety of errors on the Android platform. </p>
<p> So, let’s clear the cache and data from Google Drive and move from there. Here’s how to do it on your handheld device: </p>
<p> Open Google Drive from the apps list. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Reinstall Google Drive </p>
<p> The next step you can try if Google Drive download is not working is to reinstall Google Drive. This usually helps users when certain apps start misbehaving. If you have Google Drive as a system app, you can uninstall updates and update the app later on. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to reinstall Google Drive on Android: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for Drive. </p>
<p> Uninstall the Google Drive app. </p>
<p> Install the app again and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Log out and log in again with your Google Account </p>
<p> The problem at hand might be related to your Google Account. Things can go awry for a variety of reasons and the best way to tackle them is by resetting your Google Account. That way, you should be able to access and download files stored in Google Drive without further issues. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to remove and re-add your Google Account on Android: </p>
<p> Select Google. </p>
<p> Tap More and remove the Google account. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check the connection </p>
<p> This is self-explanatory. In order to access remote cloud servers and access or download your files, you need a stable network connection. Many errors with a variety of codes are caused by connectivity issues. So, firstly, disable VPN or Proxy and then inspect your connection. </p>
<p> You can try downloading files with the Mobile Network, although we don’t recommend that if you have a limited data plan. </p>
<p> If you are able to connect and browse via, say, Chrome, move to the last solution. On the other hand, if you can’t connect to a wireless network, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Disable and re-enable Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Restart your device and router/modem. </p>
<p> Enable Airplane mode and disable it after a minute or so. </p>
<p> Reset the Network settings. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Use the web-based Google Drive client on your handset or PC </p>
<p> Finally, if you are unable to download files on your mobile device via the standard Google Drive app, consider using a browser. Even better, try downloading files on your PC. </p>
<p> Here’s how to use Chrome for Android to access Google Drive on the Web: </p>
<p> Open Chrome on your Android device. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and check the Desktop site box. </p>
<p> Navigate to Google Drive. </p>
<p> Download files to your device from there. </p>
<p> Just don’t forget to use the Incognito mode on your browser when accessing Google Drive on a PC. You might also want to use Google Chrome as Google’s services have certain limitations on alternative browsers. This is arguably unfair, but that’s a monopoly for you and we can hardly do anything about that. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thanks for reading and we sincerely hope these steps helped you address the problem with Google Drive downloads. In case you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-drive-keeps-going-offline" parent_folder="web1" id="file17847629" filename="google-drive-keeps-going-offline">
<p> Fix: Google Drive keeps going offline on Android </p>
<p> Google Drive is the default Android cloud drive and probably the most used one by Android users around the world. It’s usually quite a reliable solution for both regular or paying users but it does have occasional issues from time to time. Recently, users reported that Google Drive keeps going offline even when they are connected to a Wi-Fi network. </p>
<p> Why does my Google Drive keep going offline? </p>
<p> There are multiple reasons why Google Drive might keep going offline even if you want to access online content. Failing network connection and a temporary bug in the current version are just some of them. </p>
<p> If you are affected by this problem, make sure to check the steps we provided below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Disable Offline files </p>
<p> The first thing to do if you repetitively get this problem is to disable certain files that you made available offline. It seems that there’s a glitch that prevents online access for files that are made available offline. </p>
<p> Once you’ve disabled offline files, make sure that you are connected to a stable Wi-Fi network and try accessing them again. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check the connection </p>
<p> This goes without saying but Google Drive requires a stable Wi-Fi or mobile data network in order to access files. Now, most of the time the problem is not in the connection but we must, for the sake of troubleshooting, add it to the list. </p>
<p> Here are some things you should check: </p>
<p> Reboot your router and phone/tablet. </p>
<p> If you are using Mobile Data, open Google Drive > hamburger menu > Settings and disable the “Transfer files only over Wi-Fi” option. </p>
<p> Disable and re-enable Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear cache and data from Google Drive </p>
<p> The next step is rather obvious, as well. Cached data can and will occasionally cause issues with Android apps. Cached data is locally stored and used to speed up loading when accessing apps. However, if it gets corrupt, it might lead to issues. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from the Google Drive app for Android: </p>
<p> Open Google Drive from the apps list. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall Google Drive and check the permission </p>
<p> In case previous steps were in vain, we recommend reinstalling the app and then checking permissions. If Google Drive comes as a system app, you won’t be able to uninstall it. However, you can uninstall all updates, reboot your device, and wait for it to update. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reinstall (or reset) Google Drive on Android: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for Drive. </p>
<p> Uninstall the Google Drive app. </p>
<p> Install the app again and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Additionally, you should probably check the permissions after reinstalling the app. Make sure to grant every permission under Settings > Apps > All apps > Google Drive > Permissions. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Install an older version of Google Drive via APK </p>
<p> Now, it’s not unusual for Google to release an unfinished app and that might, of course, lead to a variety of issues. In their defense, most major changes are added via server-side updates and in batches. That way, they can protect the majority of users. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, if the current version of Google Drive is not working for you no matter what you try, you can sideload an older version via an APK and fix it that way. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to sideload an older version of Google Drive on your Android device: </p>
<p> Uninstall Google Drive from your device as previously explained. </p>
<p> Download an older APK (not older than 2 months preferably) and grant permission to install from third-party sources when prompted. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Sign out and then sign in with your Google Account </p>
<p> Also, some users who tend to use multiple Google Accounts on their Android device reported that signing out and signing back again to Google Account resolved the error completely. After that Google Drive stopped going offline. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to sign out and sign back into your main Google Account: </p>
<p> Choose Accounts. </p>
<p> Select Google. </p>
<p> Tap More and remove the Google account. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Try Drive on the web </p>
<p> Finally, this might be a global issue that’s temporary preventing all users from accessing their cloud-based files. You can try and access your files from on the web-based client on your device, by checking the Desktop box before searching for Google Drive. </p>
<p> You can check if Google Drive is down by navigating, here. And, with that, we can call it a wrap. In case you have any questions or suggestions, make sure to share them with us in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-drive-not-syncing-android" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844242" filename="google-drive-not-syncing-android">
<p> Fix: Google Drive won’t sync in Android </p>
<p> Google Drive is one of the most-used cloud services in the world. In its favor goes the fact that this service is available on most, if not all Android devices as a preinstalled app. Additionally, with 15 Gb of free storage space and multi-platform support, it’s not unusual for you to choose it over, say Dropbox or Microsoft’s One Drive. </p>
<p> However, a cloud backup software that can’t sync isn’t of great use to no one. Namely, it’s not uncommon for Google Drive on Android to stop syncing, and for some users, that’s a nightmare to cope with. So, for that purpose, we prepared a list of workarounds that should help you resolve this issue. If your One Drive app has a problem with syncing, you’ve come to the right place. </p>
<p> Check the connection </p>
<p> The first step you should take when troubleshooting any connection-dependent app is to, obviously, check the connection. If your connection is unstable or the app permission is blocked in the system, Drive won’t be able to connect to the storage server, and there so, won’t be able to sync the data. For that purpose, make sure to check these steps: </p>
<p> Connect and make sure that the connection is stable. </p>
<p> Use Wi-Fi for syncing rather than mobile data. </p>
<p> If you’re in need to use the mobile data, make sure that the ”Transfer files only over Wi-Fi” option is disabled. Navigate to Drive > 3-line menu > Settings, and toggle off Transfer files only over Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Restart your device to clear bugs that may occur from time to time. </p>
<p> Make sure that the sync is enabled. Navigate to Drive > 3-line menu > Settings > Backup & reset, and enable ”Back up my data”. </p>
<p> Update the Drive app </p>
<p> Additionally, you should make sure that the app is up to date. Even though the auto-update of the Play Store tends to do that work for you, it won’t hurt if you check for the updates manually. That’s as simplistic procedure as they come, and here is how to do it: </p>
<p> Tap Play Store app. </p>
<p> Open 3-line menu. </p>
<p> Open My Apps and Games. </p>
<p> If there’s Drive update available, tap Update to download and install it. </p>
<p> Check for changes with the sync procedure. </p>
<p> Clear app’s data </p>
<p> Another usual workaround that comes into play when the certain app won’t function as intended is related to accumulated data that, occasionally, may cause issues. Namely, the data that certain app collects can get corrupted and that will result in malfunction. Even the slightest file can stall the whole sync process, in this case. So, make sure to clear data before moving on with other steps. </p>
<p> Navigate to Drive. </p>
<p> Tap to open App info. </p>
<p> Reset your device and sign in again. Additionally, you can download the cache within the app settings. This is how to do it. </p>
<p> Open the Drive app. </p>
<p> Tap 3-line menu. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Clear cache. </p>
<p> This process won’t delete any of your data, but rather clear the cached documents. </p>
<p> Sign out and sign in again with the Google account </p>
<p> This may be too obvious, but it may be worth a while. There’s a good chance that, if you’re using Drive on multiple platforms, something went wrong during the backup procedure, some kind of corruption. Moreover, some of the files you’re trying to sync on Google Drive for Android may not be updated from the other device. So, stop the syncing/backup procedure and log out from PC/Mac/Android clients or browser extension, and log in again. </p>
<p> Once you’ve finished with this, your problem should be gone. However, if you’re sure that the problem is strictly app-related, there’s still one thing you can do. </p>
<p> Use Drive trough the web browser </p>
<p> This is far away from the solution, but it may prove as the simplest temporary workaround. You can log in with your credentials in any given Android web browser and access your data. If the app isn’t doing the job as intended, you can always turn around to good old browser. This is how to use Google Drive via the browser: </p>
<p> Open the browser of your choice. </p>
<p> Navigate to drive.google.com </p>
<p> Enter your credentials to log in. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app </p>
<p> At the end, you can try and resolve syncing problems with Google Drive by resetting to factory values. In other words, Android is the system as any other and there are cases when something suddenly went wrong with the individual app or all-around performance. Especially if you have multiple backup solutions, e.g. Huawei Backup or Samsung Cloud. So, your last resort is to restore the factory settings. </p>

<p> Fix: Google Earth not loading on Android </p>
<p> Google Earth never fails to amaze as it offers a complete virtual exploring of various places. It’s available on a web-based platform, Earth Pro for desktop, or Android and iOS apps. Now, although the Android app is a true pocket version of this amazing app, it does have some issues. Users report that Google Earth is not loading at all after they run the app. </p>
<p> No worries, though, as we have a way to solve this without too much hassle. </p>
<p> How do I fix Google Earth not loading on Android? </p>
<p> Even though it usually works just fine, there are instances when Google Earth is not loading on Android for no apparent reason. The most common culprits for that are connectivity issues and corrupted local cache. </p>
<p> If you are experiencing similar issues with Google Earth, we have 4 solutions for you. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear app’s cache and data </p>
<p> The first thing you can do is clear persistent cache and data from the Google Earth app. Cached files can get corrupted which will ultimately lead to issues with the app itself. After you completely clear them, the Earth will reload everything and probably work as intended afterward. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from Google Earth on Android: </p>
<p> Locate Google Earth and open it. </p>
<p> Select Storage. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check the network connection </p>
<p> Moving on, the most common and rather obvious reason why Google Earth won’t load on Android (or anywhere else for that matter) is a failed network connection. Google Earth requires a stable connection in order to load and render everything. </p>
<p> So, if you are unsure whether or not your connection is working as intended, make sure to check these tips to improve it or fix possible issues: </p>
<p> Disconnect and connect again to your wireless network. </p>
<p> Restart your phone/tablet and router or modem. </p>
<p> Disable VPN or proxy temporarily. </p>
<p> Make sure that no other devices are straining the network. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth or NFC temporarily. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings to factory values. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Turn off flight animations and reduce Rendering quality </p>
<p> If you are running Google Earth on an older Android handset with lower specs, chances are you’ll run into slow loading. The suboptimal RAM and an outdated chipset might cause this. Now, don’t worry, there’s still something you can do. </p>
<p> There are two options you can tweak to optimize Google Earth a bit and make the experience a bit more fluid. The first one is Flight Animations that should be disabled. The second is Rendering Quality which should be set to Fastest. You can experiment and see what works best. </p>
<p> Here’s how to turn off Flight Animation and lower the Rendering Quality on Google Earth: </p>
<p> Tap on the hamburger menu and open Settings. </p>
<p> Toggle off the Turn on flight animations. </p>
<p> Scroll down and open Rendering quality. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall Google Earth </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps worked for you, we recommend reinstalling the app. Even though this step is, by all means, similar to the first one, it still might help. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to reinstall Google Earth from the Play Store: </p>
<p> Open the Play Store and look for Google Earth. </p>

<p> You’ll soon be able to use your camera to navigate Google Maps </p>
<p> Oh, Google Maps. Sometimes you can’t live without it, but then there are moments when it’ll put your life in danger. And I mean literally. I remember when I was on holiday in Spain, and Google Maps has sent me straight to the highway, instead of the way to the beach. </p>
<p> Sure it was also my fault to some extent, as I should’ve been more careful. But nevertheless, I’m sure you got tricked by Google Maps at least once, and at the worst possible moment. In fact, even Google admits in its latest blog post that using just the compass and GPS is not the most convenient way of getting around in an unknown surrounding. </p>
<p> Hopefully, these misjudgments (on both sides) should happen less often now that Google is working on a new technology that should put your unintended wanderings to an end. </p>
<p> Namely, Google is developing a new project called Global Localization. This technique, as Google calls it, combines Visual Positioning Service (VPS), Google Street View, and of course AI to more accurately identify your current position, and give you more precise routes that won’t lead you to a blind street or into a canal. </p>
<p> So, how does this feature work? Well, as said above, it combines the three mentioned features. First, there’s the Visual Positioning System, which is used by Google to create maps by combining pictures of landmarks with their coordinates. Then, there’s Street View which uses the VPS index to accurately determine your location and give you the preview of it. And finally, there will be some AI touches that will make sure you’ll get as accurate results as possible. </p>
<p> On paper, the method of using your camera to re-orientate surely seems more convenient than relying solely on the compass calibration and GPS. Will it be more effective and less error-prone? The time will tell. </p>
<p> Google has started testing this technology with select Local Guides, and we expect the public rollout sometime this year. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-maps-crashing-android" parent_folder="web1" id="file17849443" filename="google-maps-crashing-android">
<p> Fix: Google Maps crashing on Android </p>
<p> Google Maps is one of the most used apps in the extensive Google ecosystem found on Android. It usually works as intended and brings navigation, exploring, and much more to millions of handsets. However, we run into more than a few reports about Google Maps crashing on Android. </p>
<p> Why does Google Maps keep crashing on Android? </p>
<p> There’s a variety of reasons why this would happen so it’s hard to pinpoint the exact culprit. What you should do immediately is reboot your device and try accessing Google Maps again. </p>
<p> In case that doesn’t work, make sure to go through the steps we listed below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Update the app </p>
<p> The first step to take if Google Maps is crashing or won’t open is to ensure that the app is up to date. Updates are usually automatically administered but it won’t cost you to check for the latest version of Google Maps in the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need do: </p>
<p> Open the Play Store. </p>
<p> Tap on the hamburger menu and open My apps & games. </p>
<p> Under the Updates tab, tap Update all. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear app’s cache and data </p>
<p> The next applicable step is to clear the locally stored cache and data from Google Maps. That way, you’ll reset the app and make it re-initialize. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from Google Maps on Android: </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reinstall the app </p>
<p> If the previous steps failed to resolve Google Maps crashing on Android, make sure to give a go to reinstallation. Many users were able to resolve the problem by simply reinstalling the app. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reinstall Google Maps and avoid further crashes: </p>
<p> Navigate to the Play Store. </p>
<p> Locate Google Maps. </p>
<p> Uninstall the app. </p>
<p> Install the app again and then reboot your phone. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Leave the Beta program </p>
<p> In case you are a beta tester for Google Maps, make sure to leave the program. The Beta versions might bring new features faster but the public version is the way to go if you want to avoid issues. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to leave the Beta program for Google Maps: </p>
<p> Open the Play Store again. </p>
<p> Search and select Google Maps. </p>
<p> Scroll down and, under the You’re a beta tester section, tap Leave. </p>
<p> Wait until the changes are made and reinstall the app. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Check permissions </p>
<p> Alternatively, make sure that all the necessary permissions are granted. Usually, Google Maps require solely the Location Services permission, but for the sake of troubleshooting, we recommend enabling all remaining permissions. </p>
<p> Here’s how to check permissions for Google Maps on Android: </p>
<p> Navigate again to Settings > Apps > All apps > Maps. </p>
<p> Tap Permissions. </p>
<p> Ensure that all required permissions are granted and try opening Google Maps again. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Install an older APK version </p>
<p> Finally, if the current version won’t work, we can only recommend downgrading via an older APK. All app versions to date are available on third-party websites and can be downloaded and sideloaded onto your device. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to install an older APK version of Google Maps: </p>
<p> Uninstall Google Maps. </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror, here, or any other APK hub online. </p>
<p> Download an older APK version but not older than two months. </p>
<p> Grant permission to install apps from untrusted sources. </p>
<p> Install the APK and give it a go. </p>
<p> That’s it. Thank you for reading and tell us if this was helpful or not in the comments section below. We look forward to your feedback. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-maps-not-showing-directions-android" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844203" filename="google-maps-not-showing-directions-android">
<p> Fix: Google Maps not showing directions in Android </p>
<p> Google Maps is unpredictable. It will be your friend and trustful guide 99 times out of 100, but there’s always one time when it will turn into a trickster and lead you to a dead end or completely out of the way. </p>
<p> Showing you the wrong turn one time isn’t a big deal. But what if it turns completely against you and stops showing directions altogether? That’s not something you want, especially if you’re in a foreign city or unknown surroundings. </p>
<p> Luckily, there’s a solution in case Google Maps stops showing directions. So, don’t panic. Instead, check out the following workarounds. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Reset Google Play services </p>
<p> Like any other Google app, Google Maps is tightly connected to the Google Play services. So, if the services aren’t functioning properly, you won’t be able to use Google Maps to the fullest, with most features out of order. In this case, the directions. </p>
<p> The easiest solution is to reset the Google Play services. And here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Apps or Apps Manager (depending on your phone). If you can’t find it, simply search for installed apps in the Settings search bar. </p>
<p> Locate Google Play Services in the Apps Manager (if you can’t find it, choose Show all apps or Show system services from additional settings). </p>
<p> Tap Google Play Services and choose Clear data. </p>
<p> Wait for the process to finish, and sign in to the Play Store once again. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear the cache </p>
<p> I know you hate when you see clearing the cache as one of the offered solutions, but it works. Sometimes. Anyway, it won’t hurt if you try clearing the cache. You can either resolve the problem or stay where you are. </p>
<p> Now that we’re over this, let’s move on to the actual work. Here’s how to clear the Google Maps cache in Android: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Apps Manager (as explained above). </p>
<p> Find Google Maps and tap it. </p>
<p> Tap Clear cache. </p>
<p> If clearing the cache doesn’t resolve the problem, you can also try with clearing data altogether. However, keep in mind that deleting all data will erase all your offline maps, so only do this if you have internet access. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Make sure Location is on </p>
<p> Here’s a quick one. The Location service needs to be running for Google Maps to draw directions from the server. So, go on and make sure the Location service or GPS is enabled. You can easily enable this service by tapping its shortcut in the top settings panel. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check the internet connection </p>
<p> Unless you’re navigating an offline map, Google Maps won’t work without a stable internet connection. So, just make sure you’re properly connected to the internet before moving on to another solution. </p>
<p> In case you notice there’s something wrong with your internet connection, check out this article for additional solutions. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Calibrate the compass </p>
<p> Google Maps will almost exclusively point you in the wrong direction if the compass isn’t calibrated properly. So, if none of the above-mentioned solutions resolved the problem, make sure to calibrate or re-calibrate the compass. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Open Google Maps. </p>
<p> Tap the blue dot that indicates your location. </p>
<p> Follow the on-screen instructions (make a figure 8 with your phone). </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Enable the High Accuracy mode </p>
<p> There’s one more thing you can do to ensure Google Maps receives as accurate signals as possible. And that is enabling the High Accuracy mode. Here’s how to enable this mode: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Location. </p>
<p> Go to Mode, and enable High Accuracy. </p>
<p> Bonus: Download offline maps </p>
<p> To avoid connection problems in the first place, you can always download the offline maps of the area you’re navigating. Having offline maps requires neither GPS nor internet connection, so it’s a perfect solution for roaming foreign cities, where you have limited internet availability. </p>
<p> To download the offline map, go to Google Maps > Settings > Offline maps. Select the area you want to download and you’re good to go. </p>
<p> Just keep in mind that offline maps are quite limited compared to ‘regular’ maps. For instance, you’ll only be getting driving directions instead of walking or cycling, and you won’t have traffic info, alternate routes, or lane guidance. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the problem with Google Maps not showing directions, and that you don’t feel like you’re in a maze anymore. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-maps-not-talking" parent_folder="web1" id="file17843115" filename="google-maps-not-talking">
<p> Fix: Google Maps not talking in Android </p>
<p> If you’re on holiday in a foreign city, you probably rely heavily on Google Maps. So, the last thing you want is something to go wrong. But it could happen. For example, Google Maps might suddenly stop showing directions or telling you where to go. </p>
<p> In case you stop hearing voice directions from Google Maps, you’ll probably want to solve this problem quickly. Because navigating unknown surroundings while constantly staring at your phone is neither safe nor convenient. </p>
<p> So, check out some of our solutions for the voice directions problem in Google Maps, and you should quickly resolve the issue. At least I hope so. </p>
<p> How do I get voice directions in Google Maps? </p>
<p> As a quick reminder, let’s first see how can you get voice directions in Google Maps in the first place. Here’s how to enable voice directions: </p>
<p> Open Google Maps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Navigation settings > Voice level. </p>
<p> Choose Guidance volume (Softer, Normal, or Louder). </p>
<p> If you’re using Bluetooth earbuds, make sure to enable Play voice over Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Now that you know voice directions are enabled, let’s see what we can do if this feature stops working. </p>
<p> What to do when Google Maps voice navigation stops working </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check your device’s volume </p>
<p> I know this one sounds obvious, but I cannot tell you how many times I had my sound on mute without noticing. So, tap the volume button or go to settings and make sure your ringer is on. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Make sure voice is turned on in the Maps app </p>
<p> Another obvious one, but let’s exploit all our options. Here’s how to check if the sound is turned on inside the Maps app: </p>
<p> Enter your destination, and tap Start. </p>
<p> Tap the sound button in the upper-right corner, and make sure it’s enabled. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear the app’s cache </p>
<p> We move from obvious solutions to clichés now. If you still can’t hear any voice from Google Maps, clearing the app’s cache could be a solution. Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Apps or Apps Manager (depending on your phone and ROM). </p>
<p> Locate Google Maps in the Apps Manager (if you can’t find it, choose Show all apps or Show system services from additional settings). </p>
<p> Tap Google Maps and choose Storage. </p>
<p> Tap Clear cache. Note: This process may vary on your phone, but you have an idea of what to do. </p>
<p> You can also try and Clear data instead of cache, just keep in mind it will completely reset the app, so all your settings and downloaded maps and routes will be deleted. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check your Bluetooth headphones </p>
<p> If you’re using your Bluetooth headphones or earbuds to listen to Google Maps, make sure these are properly connected. I already showed you above how to enable Google Maps voice over Bluetooth, so if that one’s in check, try reconnecting your wireless headset once again. </p>
<p> If everything’s in place, move on to the next workaround. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Disable navigation over Bluetooth </p>
<p> If you don’t use a Bluetooth headset and have Google Maps ‘talk’ through your phone’s speaker or wired earbuds, you might want to disable the Play voice over Bluetooth option. In fact, a few users reported that disabling this feature actually resolved the problem. </p>
<p> So, just go back to Settings > Navigation settings > Voice level, and disable Play voice over Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Update Google Maps </p>
<p> Even though it’s a full-fledged service, you still use Google Maps as an app on your phone. And apps tend to go a little mad sometimes. If something inside the app’s code is preventing Google Maps from sending voice directions, Google will probably notice it. </p>
<p> And when it does, you can expect the patching update to arrive soon. So, besides trying all these workarounds, make sure Google Maps is up to date, as well. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Reinstall Google Maps </p>
<p> If you still can’t make Google Maps to ‘talk’ to you, maybe it’s time to ‘break the wheel’. Go on and delete the app, and then install it from the Play Store once again. Yes, you’ll lose all your settings and downloads, but a few users reported that reinstalling the app actually solved the problem, so it might be worth it. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the Google Maps voice navigation problem. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, just let us know in the comments below. </p>
<p> 9 COMMENTS </p>
<p> Your solution does not work. Why isn’t Google fixing their issue? It is life threatening to have no voice while you are driving in traffic and Google closes the voice directions off. Google made the product, they need to fix it. I will never TRUST Google again. </p>

<p> Drove through Northern Italy on Google Maps. Map directions at most roundabouts were different to the voice instructions. One would say ok wave at the second exit but the map would say take the first exit. Happened regularly. Now I get no voice instructions. Just a loud noise before each junction </p>

<p> Fix: Google Maps not working on Android </p>
<p> One of the most used Google apps must be Google Maps, an exquisite mapping service that, over years, grew to be so much more than a convenient navigation tool. However, some Android users claim that Google Maps are not working for them. </p>
<p> We made sure to explain how to resolve this in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Why is Google Maps not working on Android? </p>
<p> Google Maps usually won’t work on Android due to connection and GPS issues. Although, there are instances when a bug is causing issues with the app. </p>
<p> In case Google Maps are not working for you, check the steps we listed below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear cache and data from Google Maps </p>
<p> The first thing to do is clearing cache and data locally. Google Maps tend to pile up a lot of locally stored pre-loaded data that tends to get corrupt over time. In order to address a large spectrum of issues that might occur, we suggest starting with this. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to clear cache and data from Google Maps on Android: </p>
<p> Select Manage apps, App manager, or All apps. </p>
<p> Locate and open Google Maps. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check the Network and inspect Location settings </p>
<p> In order to use the full potential of Google Maps, you’ll need both a stable network connection and GPS Location Services. You can, indeed, download and use offline maps, but they still depend on Location Services. Also, based on the region of an offline map, the overall experience (navigation and exploration) isn’t all that good in smaller areas. </p>
<p> So, if there’s any loading-related issue, we recommend thoroughly inspecting the network and GPS before moving on. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to ensure that both GPS and Wi-Fi (or mobile data) are working as intended: </p>
<p> Make sure the Location is on and Google Maps have permission to access Location. </p>
<p> Enable the “Use assisted GPS” in Location settings. </p>
<p> Reboot your router or make sure that your APN is properly configured for Mobile Data. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reinstall Google Maps </p>
<p> If the previous steps failed, you can try and reinstall Google Maps from the Google Play Store. That way, you’ll get the latest version of Google Maps while clearing possible local issues, too. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reinstall Google Maps on your Android: </p>
<p> Navigate to the Play Store. </p>
<p> Locate Google Maps. </p>
<p> Uninstall the app. </p>
<p> Install the app again and then reboot your phone. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Download an older version of the app </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the steps helped you address the problem, we suggest downloading an older APK version of Google Maps. You can do so on any APK-aggregate website, like APK Mirror or any other. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to download an older APK of Google Maps and install it on your Android handset: </p>
<p> Uninstall Google Maps. </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror, here, or any other APK hub online. </p>
<p> Download an older APK version but not older than two months. </p>
<p> Grant permission to install apps from untrusted sources. </p>
<p> Install the APK and give it a go. </p>
<p> You can, alternatively, use Google Maps Go for the time being. It’s a lighter alternative but it might come in handy until Google Maps issues are sorted out on the developer’s end. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to post your suggestions or questions in the comments section below. </p>
<p> My Google Maps stopped working at one stage – it would find my initial location and calculate a route, but after that it could not find a GPS location. I tried everything and nothing worked. Then I switched my Save Location History back ON, and all of a sudden it worked fine again. So basically if I want more privacy and not save my locaiton history, Google Maps will not work for me.. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-photos-not-backing-up-videos" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844942" filename="google-photos-not-backing-up-videos">
<p> Fix: Google Photos not backing up videos </p>
<p> Google Photos cover everything your camera takes. Both photos and videos are automatically backed up to cloud storage, so you can preserve your storage space while being able to access them everywhere. However, there seems to be an issue which comes and goes for a few years. Namely, some users are unable to back up videos. </p>
<p> We made sure to shed some light on this issue and help you resolve it as soon as possible. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Make sure the backup is enabled and check the network </p>
<p> Firstly, try taking a photo and confirm it’s successfully backed up to Google Photos. If that’s the case, double-check the Backup folders and confirm that videos are set to back up. Open Assistant in the Google Photos app to learn more about the cause. </p>
<p> Open the Google Photos app. </p>
<p> Tap on the hamburger menu and choose Settings. </p>
<p> Open “Back up & sync”. </p>
<p> Confirm that the backup for the folder containing videos is indeed enabled. </p>
<p> Tap on the Assistant card and confirm there aren’t any errors. </p>
<p> Open Albums and find the video in device folders. Tap on it and then on the cloud icon to back it up manually. </p>
<p> If, on the other hand, you’re not able to back up both photos and videos, we suggest investigating global Backup settings. Navigate to Settings > Advanced settings > Back up & reset. Disable Backup and re-enable it to deal with the possible stall. </p>
<p> In addition, confirm that the current network connection is working properly. If you use Mobile Data for uploading, navigate to Google Photos > Settings > Back up & sync and allow the app to upload files on Mobile Data. Restart your device and continue with the steps below. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Confirm that you have enough space in Google Drive </p>
<p> Google Photos service offers unlimited photo and video storage. But that stands only for the “High Quality” option. If you want your content in its original resolution, it’ll take out of those 15 gigs of free storage. </p>
<p> Therefore, make sure that you have enough free storage space in Google Drive assigned to Google account. Also, even though it’s superfluous to say, make sure that the video at hand isn’t larger than 10 GB. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear Google Photos cache </p>
<p> Even though the Google Photos app is rather consistent, there are some bugs here and there. Every new iteration comes with improvements, but it can bring up certain issues, as well. Also, due to piling up of the cached data, the app can start misbehaving. </p>
<p> Those should be good enough reasons to navigate to Apps and clear the data from Google Photos. Here’s how to do it in a few simple steps: </p>
<p> Tap Apps (Apps Manager on some devices). </p>
<p> Navigate and open Photos. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Restart your device and open the Google Photos app. </p>
<p> Sign in with your account and navigate to Settings. </p>
<p> Set backup folders to your preference and try uploading videos again. </p>
<p> You can also try resetting Google Photos to factory version and try uploading video in that state. Just navigate to Settings > Apps > Google Photos > and click Disable. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Try backing up videos on a PC </p>
<p> Finally, if you’re unable to upload a certain video (or videos), we suggest giving Google Photos for Web a try. Just transfer the video from your handset to a PC first. After you’ve done that, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Drag the video files from your PC to in-browser Google Photos. </p>
<p> Wait until the upload ends. </p>
<p> With that, we can conclude this article. If had the same or similar problem and dealt with it in a different manner, we encourage you to share it with us in the comments section below. </p>
<p> Note: This article is a part of our Google Photos coverage. If you want to learn more Google Photos tips and tricks, or you have a certain problem with this app, visit our Google Photos Hub for more content. </p>

<p> Fix: Google Photos not showing all photos </p>
<p> With the recent Material redesign and improvements in the machine-learning department, Google Photos are looking slick. But, the interface look and Assistant gimmicks won’t do you any good if the elementary purpose is failing you. Like, when the Google Photos app is not showing all photos. </p>
<p> Now, back in the October of 2017, this was a general issue for all users. It seems that Google sorted it out, but there are still some users unable to find certain photos on their phone app. Even if they’re, for some reason, easily found on Google Photos for Web. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear Google Photos cached data </p>
<p> Even though there were major issues with missing photos, pilled up data and minor bugs are the most common reasons for this issue nowadays. And, with an app as Google Photos is, you don’t need all that cached data at all. </p>
<p> The app might load faster, but nothing of importance is lost if you delete it. Furthermore, that should resolve the issue at hand and show all photos you already have in Google Photos for Web. </p>
<p> Here’s how to clear the cached data in the Google Photos app: </p>
<p> Tap Apps (Application Manager). </p>
<p> Find and open Photos. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Choose what folders you want to backup </p>
<p> In usual circumstances, Google Photos will locate the folders containing photos and ask you whether you want to back them up or skip them. Chances are that you’ve skipped a folder and the Google Photos app avoids it like a plague. </p>
<p> Also, even if you’ve already set the folder and uploaded a few photos, there’s a chance that something changed and thus, the folder isn’t backing up no more. This can be regulated with ease, by simply re-assigning the device folders in the Google Photos app. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to choose which folders Google Photos should backup: </p>
<p> Tap on the hamburger menu and select Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Back up & sync. </p>
<p> Choose Back up device folders. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Activate Google Drive integration </p>
<p> Even though Google Photos is a service on its own, it’s still, basically, a moderately advanced photo gallery. All uploaded photos are still stored in Google Drive > Google Photos folder. Therefore, if you’ve backed up photos to Google Drive, it doesn’t mean that those photos will show in Google Photos gallery. That need’s to be enabled on its own. </p>
<p> For that reason, we suggest enabling Google Drive sync to Google Photos. Here are the exact steps you need to follow: </p>
<p> Open the Google Photos app. </p>
<p> Tap on the hamburger menu and select Settings. </p>
<p> Under the Google apps, toggle on Google Drive. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check the Archive and Trash Bin </p>
<p> Now, what if you’ve already successfully uploaded photos, but they’re nowhere to be found? Our best guess is to check both Archive and Trash Bin. Besides identifying faces and reordering the photos, Google Photos Assistant can suggest archiving photos. </p>
<p> Now, don’t worry, they are safe from any harm in the Archive. On the other hand, if you’ve deleted them, you have only up to 60 days to restore them. After that, they’re gone for good, so have that in mind. </p>
<p> To access the Google Photos Archive and Trash Bit, just open the app and tap on the hamburger menu. There you should find both options. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Move folders containing photos to internal memory </p>
<p> Me, personally, store all camera photos on the external memory. But that’s a built-in app. Other apps and services hardly allow changing the folder in which they store photos. Now, there’s a good reason for that. Most of the handsets require special permissions in order to access the SD card. And that, in this scenario, pose a difficulty for Google Photos. </p>
<p> Some user’s reports state that Google Photos can’t even locate the folder. And for that reason, we suggest moving the folder from the SD card to the internal storage. You can do it with the built-in file explorer (Files or My Files) which comes pre-installed on the device. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Open the Files app. </p>
<p> Access the SD and tap-and-hold on the folder you want to move. </p>
<p> Choose Move from the available options. </p>
<p> Get back to internal memory and just tap Move to paste the folder there. </p>
<p> Open Google Photos and navigate to Settings > Back up & sync > Back up device folders. </p>
<p> Toggle on the newly-transferred folder and wait for the photos to upload. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Use your PC to re-upload photos </p>
<p> Finally, the only remaining solution we can suggest is re-uploading photos to Google Photos for Web via PC. Now, what you’ll need to do primarily is to transfer photos to your PC. Afterward, you shouldn’t have a hard time dragging them to a Google Photos. </p>
<p> Select all photos and drag-and-drop them into a web browser. </p>
<p> Wait for the upload to finish. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data on your handset, open Google Photos and log in. </p>
<p> The troublesome photos should appear now. </p>
<p> After that, repeat the steps from the first solution and reset cached data in the Google Photos app. The missing photos should appear the next time you open Google Photos. </p>
<p> With that said, we’re through with this error. Make sure to tell us whether the enlisted solutions helped you in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: Google Photos not uploading photos in Android </p>
<p> Google Photos is probably your go-to option when it comes to backing up your photos. But, what if the app simply stops uploading photos to the server? That puts you at risk of accidentally deleting a precious image and lose it forever. </p>
<p> However, even if Google Photos stops uploading photos, there’s no need to panic. Try some of the solutions presented below, and I hope you’ll manage to resolve the problem. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Make sure sync is enabled </p>
<p> Google Photos Sync is a feature equally important for both uploading and downloading photos on your Android device. Before we move on to other solutions, make sure this integral feature is enabled. Here’s how: </p>
<p> Open Google Photos. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Back up & sync. </p>
<p> Make sure Back up & sync is enabled. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check the connection </p>
<p> If your internet connection isn’t stable, you won’t be able to upload photos to the cloud, especially if they’re larger files. So, just make sure you’re properly connected to the internet. In case you notice any issues, check this article for additional solutions. </p>
<p> On top of that, Google Photos isn’t automatically set to upload your photos when you’re using cellular data. Obviously, this is not recommended due to possible overuse of data, but if you want to enable this option, just do the following. </p>
<p> Open Google Photos. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Back up & sync. </p>
<p> Under Cellular data back up, toggle Photos and/or Videos. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear the cache </p>
<p> Clearing the app cache (and data) is one of the oldest tricks in the book. Sure, it falls under the “generic solutions” category, but it could actually resolve the problem, so you should try it nevertheless. </p>
<p> Here’s how to clear Google Photo cache in Android: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Apps or Apps Manager (depending on your phone). </p>
<p> Find Photos. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Tap Clear cache. </p>
<p> If clearing cache doesn’t resolve the problem, you can come back and Clear storage (data). Just keep in mind this will completely reset the app, and you’ll have to set it up from scratch again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Update apps </p>
<p> It’s possible that the uploading issue is actually a widespread problem that was caused by some error in the code. If that’s indeed the case, Google will probably deliver a fixing update soon. So, just make sure you keep all your apps up to date, and the problem might ‘solve itself’. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Check the storage </p>
<p> By default, Google allows you to store an unlimited number of pictures and videos in Photos, but at the expense of quality. When setting up the backup, you can choose whether you want to upload as many photos as you want, but in High quality, or you want to retain the original quality, but you get to use only 12GB of the storage space. </p>
<p> In case you opted to upload your photos in original size, you may run out of storage space sooner than you think. If that’s indeed the case, you have two options. You can purchase additional space, or switch to uploading High quality photos. </p>
<p> If you want to purchase additional storage, visit Google’s Storage page to see how much space you’re using and the available plans to purchase more. </p>
<p> But if you don’t want to purchase additional space, you can always switch to the unlimited option and upload (lower) High quality photos. Don’t worry, the difference is barely noticeable, so you’ll be fine most of the time. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change the upload size in Google Photos: </p>
<p> Open Google Photos. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Back up & sync. </p>
<p> Tap Upload Size. </p>
<p> Choose High quality (free unlimited storage). </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Reinstall the app </p>
<p> If none of the previous solutions resolved the problem, try reinstalling the app. Who knows, maybe that will resolve the uploading issue. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the problem with uploading images and videos to Google Photos. If you have any additional questions or comments, just let us know in the comments down below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-photos-shows-blank-photos" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844940" filename="google-photos-shows-blank-photos">
<p> Fix: Google Photos shows blank photos </p>
<p> Google Photos is popular because it’s convenient. It allows you to access all your photos from all your devices with literally one tap. The idea is simple in design, and it should work flawlessly, right? </p>
<p> Well, issues actually occur, more or less often. Because Google Photos on your Android phone is still just an app. The particular problem we’re talking about in this article is when Google Photos shows blank photos. It may not be a big and complicated issue, but it sure is annoying. </p>
<p> So, if you just see blank containers when you open Google Photos, check out the following solutions. I hope you’ll resolve the problem. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Change the page style </p>
<p> Sometimes, solving the problem could be as simple as changing the Gallery layout. A certain bug might have occurred, causing photos to appear blank. Just try a different layout, and the problem might magically disappear. </p>
<p> To change the Gallery layout in the Google Photos app, tap the three dots in the search bar, go to Layout, and change one of the Layouts (Day view, Month view, or Comfortable view). </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check your internet connection </p>
<p> If your internet connection is unstable or ‘weak’, Google Photos might not be able to display all your photos properly, especially if they’re all on the cloud, and not in your device storage. </p>
<p> So, before moving on, make sure you’re properly connected to the internet. In case you notice any issues, check out this article for additional solutions. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Disable Data Saver </p>
<p> Speaking of the internet connection, if you’re on a cellular network with the Data Saver on, Google Photos might not work properly, because it’ll try to save as much data as possible. So, if you want to access your photos while using the cellular data, go on and disable Data Saver. </p>
<p> Just keep in mind, accessing Google Photos without a data saver can eat up a huge chunk of your data, so handle with care. </p>
<p> Here’s how to disable Data Saver in Android: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Network & internet. </p>
<p> Tap Data usage > Data Saver. </p>
<p> Disable the Use Data Saver option. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Clear the app cache and data </p>
<p> I know clearing the app cache and data is a generic solution, but it really helps sometimes. So, it won’t hurt if you try it, in case no other workaround resolves the issue. </p>
<p> Here’s how to clear Google Photo cache in Android: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Apps or Apps Manager (depending on your phone). </p>
<p> Find Photos. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Tap Clear cache. </p>
<p> If clearing cache doesn’t resolve the problem, you can come back and Clear storage (data). Just keep in mind this will completely reset the app, and you’ll have to set it up from scratch again. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Update the app </p>
<p> Updates solve problems! That’s the main purpose of an update, besides improving an app’s functionality and features. There’s a chance the problem with blank photos was caused by the very last update you installed, and the next update will deal with it. So, just make sure the Google Photos app and all other Google apps are up to date. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the problem with blank photos in Google Photos. If you have any comments or questions, feel free to write them down in the comments below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-pixel-2-market-share" parent_folder="web1" id="file17842040" filename="google-pixel-2-market-share">
<p> Google Pixel market share: Should you bet on the Pixel 2? </p>
<p> According to the latest market research from comScore, the Google Pixel currently holds just 0.7 percent of the US smartphone market share. Google’s very first flagship device is way behind devices from Apple, Samsung, and even LG, Motorola, and HTC. </p>
<p> These results are quite surprising for everyone who follows the ongoings at Google. Experts, reviewers, and even users all agree that the Google Pixel is a quality device. It comes with exceptional hardware, the purest form of Google’s stock Android, and is packed into a nicely designed box. </p>
<p> But apparently, none of that is enough for even 1 percent of the biggest smartphone market in the world. </p>
<p> The trend sells </p>
<p> The hype about the Pixel devices in all the major media outlets is real. Google’s smartphones are very well-covered, and journalists absolutely love them. It’s a fact. </p>
<p> However, that’s not the case with regular users. Besides a wide coverage, people are still not convinced they should buy a Pixel device. </p>
<p> We’re just talking about the US here. Because, truth be told, the Pixel devices aren’t so widely available to everyone on this planet. But the US customers have relatively easy access to them. </p>
<p> So, why exactly are Google’s smartphones less popular than the competition? Two words – trend, and trust. </p>
<p> In the Pixel case, the actual quality of the phone has nothing to do with its popularity. In plain English, Apple and Samsung have simply developed a strong trend among users, and it’s extremely hard (nearly impossible) for other vendors to come even close. Even for a powerhouse like Google. </p>
<p> Another reason is, I believe, the trust people have in Google’s first in-house phone. </p>
<p> Many users don’t feel like early adopters. The way they see it, they simply don’t want to be ‘lab rats’ for Google’s first mobile phone. People simply weren’t ready to take the risk. Even though Google made a legitimately great phone. </p>
<p> Combine all of this, and you have 0.7 percent of the US mobile market share! </p>
<p> But abysmal sales didn’t discourage Google, as the company unveiled the Pixel 2. The company certainly hopes the new flagship will set them on the right path. But will that actually be the case? </p>
<p> Will the Pixel 2 score better? </p>
<p> If Google were first to ditch the headphone jack, I’d easily say that will be the biggest dealbreaker with the Pixel 2. However, as ‘jackless’ is becoming the industry standard, that’s not going to decide in which way the Pixel 2 sales go. Users won’t either have headphone jacks on Samsung and Apple devices. </p>
<p> So, what will play the role now? Once again – trend and trust! It’s all about these two, all over again. </p>
<p> Honestly, I don’t believe the Pixel will jeopardize iPhone’stitle of ‘the coolest phone to own’. So, Google can’t count on that aspect. </p>
<p> However, now that the world has already seen the first generation of Google’s phones, people could actually have more trust in them. As Google proved it can deliver high-quality premium phones. </p>
<p> To wrap this all up, I believe the Google Pixel 2 will see some increase in sales. But that still won’t be enough to come at the major players in this field. Only Google knows if that’s what fulfils the goal. </p>

<p> What are Google Play Achievements and why keeping track might be fun </p>
<p> Playing a multiplayer game without any rating isn’t as half as interesting. The competitive nature of PvP games is encoded deep (no pun intended) in the current meta-state of the mobile gaming. And that’s, basically, the function of the overlay called Google Play Games. </p>
<p> To track all in-game statistics, keep a hold of your progress and, to show you the achievements you’ve gathered over the course of playing. The last one is the one we’ll try to further explain. </p>
<p> You don’t need the Google Play Games to play the majority of MMO games available in the Store. But, for some of them, the presence of this app is a requirement. To expand on that, the Google Play Games is the ‘game’ itself. How so, you might ask, curiously? Well, by reaching accomplishments in various games, you’ll unlock achievements in the Play Games app. </p>
<p> Additionally, you’ll have several built-in classic games in Google Play Games, like Snake and PacMan. All installed games should be shown on the My Games menu, once you access the app. </p>
<p> Albeit, the more you play the game, the more achievements you’ll get. So, it’s not always about the progress or skill. The time you spend playing a game will be paid off in XP. The rewards differ and you’ll get them based on unlocking new in-game levels or setting a high score. </p>
<p> The harder the level, the more of XP you’ll gain. And, just after you’ve done something notable, the Play Games app will show you your accomplishment. That’s what’ll hook you to improve your skills or invest more time in a certain game. </p>

<p> Full Guide: How to fix common Google Play issues </p>
<p> Google Play is the heart and soul of each and every Android device. Now, imagine what would happen if that vital organ stopped working. Your phone would basically become an empty shell. </p>
<p> Luckily, such drastic Google Play issues rarely happen. So, you really don’t have to worry about not being able to download any apps on your phone. On the other hand, various minor problems with the Google Play Store can happen occasionally. And that can be quite annoying. </p>
<p> Once they happen, your device will become almost unusable, as the foundation of the Android system lies in Google Play’s associated services. We decided to dig deep into the user reports and enlisted the most common issues and their respective solutions. The list is below so feel free to check it out. </p>
<p> Fix – Google Play Services has stopped </p>
<p> This is one of the most reoccurring issues concerning Google Play Services and Google Play Store. Even though we’re referring to a built-in application and essential part of the Android platform, the Google Play Services is still prone to occasional errors. And sudden crashes are nothing strange, although not as expected as with some third-party apps. </p>
<p> What Google Play Services do is connect all installed apps with your Google account and it tends to pile up a lot of data. This application can’t be deleted or reinstalled. </p>
<p> If you’re seeing the “Google Play Services has stopped working” error, it means that something is probably wrong with the locally stored data or the app is not up-to-date. Of course, if this is an isolated case, you can just restart your device and everything should be fine. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the problem is persistent and Google Play Services crash often, here’s what you can do to resolve it: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Clear cache from the Google Play Store and Google Play Services. Open Settings > Apps & notifications > All apps > Google Play Store > Storage and tap Clear Cache. </p>
<p> Clear data from the Google Play Store and Google Play Services. Navigate to Settings > Apps & notifications > All apps > Google Play Store > Storage and tap Clear Data. </p>
<p> Do the same with the Google Services Framework. Go to Settings > Apps & notifications > All apps > tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Show system > open Google Services Framework and clear cache and data. </p>
<p> Reset the Google Play Store to factory settings. Just access the app in App settings, tap on the 3-dot menu and uninstall updates. </p>
<p> Fix – Google Play Services is updating </p>
<p> This is a quite rare issue but it affected and it might affect a lot of Android users. Moreover, it affects almost exclusively users who enrolled in the Beta program for the Google Play Services. This issue was distinctively bothering Huawei and Honors users, but it might happen on various devices, nonetheless. Google is the one to partially blame, as that Beta update wasn’t well-optimized. But, we all know that the Beta versions are for testing and not exactly recommended on daily-driver devices. </p>
<p> By any case, if you run into this problem where the Google Play Services app is constantly updating, we recommend taking these steps: </p>
<p> Clear Google Play Services cache and data. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps & notifications (Application manager). </p>
<p> Select All apps. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data. </p>
<p> Leave the Beta program for the Google Play Services and reinstall the app. </p>
<p> Open Google Play Services in Settings again and open App details. </p>
<p> Under the “You’re beta tester” section, tap Leave. </p>
<p> Wait until the Google Play Services reinstall a stable version and restart your handset. </p>
<p> Uninstall Google Play Services updates and update the app again. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Security & location. </p>
<p> Open “Apps with usage access”. </p>
<p> Re-enable it again and wait until it installs. </p>
<p> Restart your handset. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Fix – Google Play Services battery drain </p>
<p> Battery drainage is a grave problem, especially since modern-day handsets already have larger screens which are major consumers on their own. And that’s why most users have zero tolerance when some rogue app takes a substantial part of their SoT (Screen-On Time). This can happen with the Google Play Services, too. But, in comparison to all third-party apps, you can’t prevent this essential app from working in the background. </p>
<p> What you can do is make sure it’s performing as intended and, that way, avoid it draining both your battery and taking too much of other system resources. </p>
<p> Here are some steps you should try in order to reduce battery drains: </p>
<p> Clear Google Play Services cache and data. </p>
<p> Disable Auto-update. Open the Google Play Store > 3-line menu > Settings > Auto-update apps, and disable it. </p>
<p> Leave the Beta program for the Google Play Services and reinstall the app. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Fix – Google Play not available in your country </p>
<p> Due to various regulations, the Google Play Store and all associated services are not available in some countries. Those countries are scarce, but some of them have an enormous user base. China is probably the best example. This directly prevents the access to all 2.9 million apps, some of them essential for the true Android experience. </p>
<p> Now, if you’re in dire need for Android’s native services, there’s a way to install the Google Play Store via the APK. We made sure to explain the whole procedure below: </p>
<p> Open Settings (pre-Oreo Android versions). </p>
<p> Choose Security and enable installation of Unknown apps. </p>
<p> Download and install the latest version of the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Fix – Google Play authentication is required </p>
<p> Another quite common problem. The Google Play authentication is dealt with the moment you’ve set up your device and administered a Google account. It shouldn’t appear again unless you’ve logged in with your Google account to an alternative device or restored the device to factory settings. Which certainly points out we’re looking at an error, a bug if you like. </p>
<p> This issue isn’t exactly complex to resolve as the troubleshooting includes all basic steps. If you’re not sure what to do, feel free to check our recommended solutions: </p>
<p> Reboot your device and try again. </p>
<p> Remove your Google account and sign in again. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Users & accounts. </p>
<p> Remove the Google account and restart your device. </p>
<p> Go back to User & accounts and sign in again. </p>
<p> Clear data and cache from the Google Services Framework. Go to Settings > Apps & notifications > All apps > tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Show system > open Google Services Framework and clear cache and data. </p>
<p> Fix – Google Play billing not supported </p>
<p> Purchasing an app, game, book or a music track on the Google Play Store is usually quite a simple task. It’s configured that way that you can do it in one tap and authorize the purchase with the fingerprint scanner. As simple as that. However, some users have run into the “Google Play billing not supported” error. </p>
<p> The problem might be on your side, so we suggest checking your payment methods and available funds. Of course, if the error is persistent after that, we encourage you to take this steps and hopefully resolve it: </p>
<p> Remove your Google Account and sign in again. Open Settings > Users & accounts, and delete your Google Account. Restart the device and sign in again. </p>
<p> Try another paying method, if available. Open Google Play Store > 3-line menu > Account > Payment methods, and add another payment method. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Fix – Google Play certification status </p>
<p> The next spot is reserved for a certification error which prevents users from accessing the Google Play Store. You’ve might’ve seen the error message “Device is not Certified by Google” if you’ve purchased the device from the unsupported market, like China. A lot of devices purchased there don’t come with the Global versions out of the box. </p>
<p> And without the Google-certified Android version, you’ll be deprecated of all Google apps, including the Google Play Store, Google Photos, Gmail etc. Also, this applies to some custom ROMs which are not certified by Google, but we’re sure that journeymen users will know what to do in this scenario. </p>
<p> For the rest, there’s a way to make your handset certified, but this isn’t a permanent or even reliable solution. Follow the steps below to give it a try: </p>
<p> Install the APK and find out your Google Service Framework (GSF) code. Copy it. </p>
<p> Now, open Chrome and navigate to the Device registration website, here, and paste the code. </p>
<p> Click Register and wait for some time. </p>
<p> Try downloading Google Play services to your device again. </p>
<p> Kudos to XDA for this solution. Albeit, it might not work on all devices and you might need to flash the current foreign ROM to a certified OS release. </p>
<p> Fix – Google Play Services crash </p>
<p> This problem is rather similar to the first one we enlisted with only slight nuanced differences. Usually, the Google Play Services crash during the backup or after the badly-administered system update, but chances are that a bad Beta update is conflicting with your Android. </p>
<p> The solutions are similar as well, and here are the instructions to follow: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Clear cache from the Google Play Store and Google Play Services. </p>
<p> Select All apps. </p>
<p> Open Google Play Store and choose Storage. </p>
<p> Reset Google Play Store app to default values. Open Settings > Apps & notifications > All apps > Google Play Store, and tap Disable and then choose to restore to factory values. Restart your device and update the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Update your system. Open Settings > System > System update, and check for updates. </p>
<p> Fix – Google Play no connection </p>
<p> Of course, in one way or another, all Google Play’s associated services require the stable connection in order to work. The Google Play Store, for example, is completely blank and offers no options without a stable Wi-Fi or Mobile Data network. Which makes the “No internet connection” error quite common. </p>
<p> Now, of course, this looks like a certain connection problem. You need to sort out the network and we’re back in the game. However, some affected users singled out the Google Play Store as the only app or service having connectivity issues. All other apps were successfully accessing the online content. </p>
<p> With that in mind, we enlisted all possible solutions, both related to connection troubleshooting and the Google Play Store itself. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth and confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Fix – Google Play couldn’t sign in </p>
<p> Another commonly-reported issue concerns the sing in error into the Google Play services. We already mentioned in one of the previous steps that the authorization is done automatically via the Google Play Services and the Google Play Framework. However, if any of the two fails, the sign in process will fail, too. </p>
<p> This, of course, can be resolved with a few steps, depending on what’s exactly causing the problem at hand. The steps you should follow are below: </p>
<p> Remove and add the Google Account again. Go to Settings > Users & accounts and remove the Google Account. After you reboot the device, sign ina gain and try accessing the Google Play. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from the Google Play Store, Google Play Services and Google Services Framework. </p>
<p> Leave the Beta program for the Google Play Services and install the stable release. </p>
<p> Error codes ( 924, 500, 927, 505, 491, 492, 963) </p>
<p> Now, besides the direct prompts, the Google Play store also has a fair number of error codes, which might come in confusing for some users. Although every error code means a different thing (network issues, failed authentication, Play Store for web issues etc.), one set of solutions is applicable to most of them. </p>
<p> Of course, you can always check for additional information online to determine what’s the exact cause as these errors appear scarcely. Here’s the list of all applicable solutions for the majority of Google Play error codes: </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from the Google Play Store and Google Play Services. </p>
<p> Open Google Play Store and choose Storage. </p>
<p> Check the connection settings. Switch from Mobile Data to Wi-Fi and vice versa, reset Network settings if necessary. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps & notifications. </p>
<p> Select All apps. </p>
<p> Click on the Disable and restore the app to factory values. </p>
<p> Restart your handset and administer updates. </p>
<p> Fix – Google Play Store “item not found” error </p>
<p> You don’t have to be a power user to spend fair chunks of time roaming through Google Play Store sections. And, sometimes, just as you’ve found a handy app, the “Item not found” error pops up suddenly. This is not an uncommon error as some others here, but it’s fair to say it won’t bother you too often. </p>
<p> There’s always a small chance that the app/game/book is removed, but that’s hardly a common case. What’s more likely is the Google Play Store and Google Play Services having some issues with the locally stored data. The Google Play Store cached data allows you, as with any other Android app, access everything faster. But, as you can see, that’s not always working the way it’s intended. </p>
<p> For that reason, we suggest following these instructions in order to resolve this error: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Clear app’s cache and data in the Google Play Store, Google Play Services and Google Services Framework (Settings > Apps & notifications > All apps > Show system > open apps one by one, access Storage and Clear Cache and Data). </p>
<p> Sign out of your Google Account and sign in again. </p>
<p> Fix – Google Play Store “insufficient storage” error </p>
<p> If some of the errors here got you bamboozled, this one is as straightforward as they come. The problem might be caused by a minor bug occasionally, but most of the time it occurs because you simply lack storage space to administer updates. </p>
<p> That’s why we encourage you to back up your data to an external storage or Google Drive (or any other cloud of your choice) and give the internal storage some space to breathe. </p>
<p> With that said, we can call it a wrap. If there’s something we forgot to enlist, don’t shy away from telling us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: Google Play Store error 963 when downloading apps </p>
<p> We all sometimes take Android user experience for granted. I mean, we can install hundreds of apps and never run into a single issue. Although the Google Play Store is not perfect, it is quite reliable. Unless it suddenly isn’t. There are Google Play Store errors like error 963 which are quite a headache. </p>
<p> If you are having a hard time fixing this error, check the steps we provided for you below. </p>
<p> How do I fix Google Play error 963? </p>
<p> If you got this error, then you are probably aware that the full error reads “App couldn’t be downloaded due to error (963)”. So, it basically prevents users from downloading or updating apps on the Google Play Store. But why it occurs? </p>
<p> The most common reason is the location of the app, as the affected app is probably located on external storage. On the other hand, it’s not impossible that the error 963 appears due to an abundance of the locally stored cache. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Remove SD card and move apps to local storage </p>
<p> This exact error and many similar issues that occur when downloading apps on the Play Store occur due to the SD card. Namely, some older Android iterations allowed for a lot of apps to be transferred to external storage (SD card) in order to relieve some internal storage. </p>
<p> Although both cache and data are still stored locally, this was quite helpful. At least for large games that can take a lot of storage space. And it still is, at least for some devices and certain apps. </p>
<p> However, some things changed in the meantime and many apps that worked and got updates seamlessly, won’t work from external storage these days. That’s the cause of our problem right there. </p>
<p> Firstly, you can try and move the app that’s causing the Google Play error 963 to local storage. If that doesn’t help, remove (unmount) your SD card and try updating again. That should address the issue. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to unmount an SD card from your device: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Storage. </p>
<p> Under the External storage, tap on the SD card and then select Unmount. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear Store’s cache and data </p>
<p> Now, if the issue persists, we suggest clearing the cache and data from the Google Play Store and the associated system app, Google Play Services. This should resolve the problem completely, as there are reports of piled up data causing the halt in system apps. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear the cache and data from the Play Store and Play Services: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Then open All apps or App Manager. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose to show system processes. </p>
<p> Locate the Google Play Store and open it. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> Clear cache first and then all data. </p>
<p> Get back to the all apps list, locate Google Play Services and clear cache and data as well. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Uninstall Play Store updates </p>
<p> In case the Google Play error 963 keeps reappearing, you can uninstall updates to Google Play Store and Google Play Services. They will update automatically and, hopefully, without the issue this time. Since we can’t reinstall system apps clean, this is the closest thing to starting from scratch. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to uninstall updates from the Play Store and Play Services: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > App manager. </p>
<p> Open the Google Play Store and tap Uninstall updates. </p>
<p> Get back to all apps (make sure that system apps are being shown), open Google Play Services and uninstall updates there as well. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and try downloading the affected app again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Download an APK of the app </p>
<p> Finally, if the error keeps popping every time you try to update or install a particular app on the Google Play Store, you can try and install it from the third-party source. Just navigate to APK Mirror, here, or any other APK aggregate website and download whatever you need. </p>
<p> You will be prompted to grant the system permission to install apps from third-party sources. Once you’ve done that, the APK installation will be done in no time. </p>
<p> There are plenty of versions of most popular apps, some dating months back. You can make your choice and avoid Google Play Store altogether. Now, we don’t recommend this for all apps or to make it standard practice for obvious security reasons. However, in this scenario, we thought to suggest it as an option. </p>
<p> With that said, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and make sure to report other Play Store issues or post your questions in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-play-error-rh-01" parent_folder="web1" id="file17845546" filename="google-play-error-rh-01">
<p> Fix: Google Play error ‘rh-01’ in Android </p>
<p> Using the Google Play Store should be a simple task. Everything is at your disposal, well organized and neat. You open it, look up for whatever you need, inform if needed, and download it to your device. </p>
<p> However, it’s not always bread and butter with the Store, even though there’s only so much it can go awry. One of the common errors goes by the “rh-01” code and it, basically, points towards the connection issues with the Store’s dedicated server. </p>
<p> If you’re troubled by this error, make sure to check the steps we enlisted below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Restart your device </p>
<p> Let’s start with the essential step. Android, like any other OS out there, is prone to temporary bugs. The execution of various applications can fail from time to time and there’s nothing to worry about. </p>
<p> Most of the time, a simple restart should resolve the problem. And since this isn’t exactly a widely-spread and persistent error, it should be resolved after you reboot your handset. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check Network settings </p>
<p> Now, if the error “rh-01” keeps reappearing every time you access Play Store, there might be something else at hand. Usually, this error means that you’re unable to connect to Play Store’s dedicated server. There’s a small possibility that the server itself is indeed down, but that’s hardly the case. At least, it won’t go down for an extended period of time. </p>
<p> On the other hand, your own inability to connect can cause this error occasionally. Even though the offline prompt for Store differs, this is still a far-fetched possibility. That’s why we encourage you to double-check whether you’re able to connect by trying out any other app. Browsing the internet with Chrome should do it. </p>
<p> If you’re unable to connect, follow the steps we provided below: </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Try connecting with the Mobile Data to determine whether the Wi-Fi is the cause. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth and Mobile Data for the time being. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. This option is easily found if you navigate to Settings > Advanced settings > Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear data from Play Store and Play Services </p>
<p> All apps store data. This includes the system-related services like Play Store and Play Services. Both apps are an essential part of the Android and they keep on piling cache and temporary files like there’s no tomorrow. This can lead to bugs, errors, or overall underperformance of the device as a whole. </p>
<p> What you can do to address this is clearing stored data accumulated by both Play Store and Play Services, respectively. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Tap Apps (Apps Manager). </p>
<p> Open the Play Store app. </p>
<p> Open Storage and clear Data. </p>
<p> Restart your device and give Play Store another go. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check the Date and Time </p>
<p> Another possible reason for this occurrence might lie in the discrepancy between the server time and the time on your device. If that’s indeed the case, and your date is, for example, set to 2017 instead of the present year, you won’t be able to access Play Store and download its content. </p>
<p> For that reason, we encourage you to navigate to Time and Date settings, manually configure both, and look for errors. Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Open Advanced settings. </p>
<p> Choose Date & time. </p>
<p> Toggle off Automatic date & time option. </p>
<p> Restart your device and look for improvements within the Store. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reset and update Play Store </p>
<p> Finally, there’s the one viable solution which is applicable to this error. Of course, some might recommend resetting your phone to factory settings, but we find it a ted unreasonable in this scenario. </p>
<p> What you can do, on the other hand, is ‘uninstalling‘ the Play Store app and updating it again. Since you can’t remove Play Store, you can at least reset it to its factory values. Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Play Store. </p>
<p> Click Disable and confirm the selection. </p>
<p> After the Play Store is restored to factory values, try using it again. </p>
<p> Later on, you can either wait for the update or download and install the APK version. </p>
<p> That’s a wrap. As a side note, we must remind you that these steps are probably of value for users using stock Android ROMs. If you’ve meddled with your handset, we’re afraid these steps might work, but that’s not certain. </p>
<p> Don’t forget to share alternative solutions or post a question. It’s more than welcome and it might help the affected community members. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-play-services-stopping" parent_folder="web1" id="file17842714" filename="google-play-services-stopping">
<p> Fix: Google Play services keeps stopping </p>
<p> Google Play Services is an integral part of Android and thus it’s necessary in order for the Play Store to work without problems. However, many Android users report issues with it, reporting that Google Play services keep stopping repeatedly. </p>
<p> If you are affected by this, don’t worry. We have a few applicable solutions for you. </p>
<p> What to do if Google Play services keep stopping? </p>
<p> There are multiple reasons why Google Play services will keep stopping. The most common reason is data corruption, although we might be looking at the system-wide problem considering this is a built-in system service. </p>
<p> Learn how to fix this by following the steps below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear data from Google Play Services and the Play Store </p>
<p> The best way to start with app troubleshooting (be that a system service or a third-party app) is by clearing cache and data. This way you’ll reset the app and fix possible cache corruption that’s not uncommon. </p>
<p> Google Play Services tend to pile up the most of data and that’s a reason more to clear your local storage. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data fro Google Play services and the Google Play Store: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Then, open App manager, Manage apps, or All apps (it depends on the phone’s OEM). </p>
<p> Once there, tap on the 3-dot menu and enable all system processes. This will add hidden system apps and services to the App list. </p>
<p> Now, locate Google Play Services entry and open it. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Finally, clear cache and data. </p>
<p> Do the same for the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Uninstall Google Play services updates </p>
<p> Alternatively, since you can’t reinstall a system app like Google Play services, you can reset it to factory values. That is done by uninstalling updates that the app got over time. </p>
<p> Here’s how to uninstall Google Play services updates in a few simple steps: </p>
<p> Navigate back to Settings > Apps > All apps > Google Play services. </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall updates. </p>
<p> Confirm when prompted and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear data from Google Services Framework </p>
<p> Moving on, there’s another Google’s system service we need to tackle in order to resolve the problem. Google Services Framework is the main component of Android and as that it relates to all included services. </p>
<p> You can’t reinstall it but we can try and clear cache and data from Google Services Framework and look for improvements. Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Navigate back to Settings > Apps > All apps and open Google Services Framework. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Clear cache first and then all Data. Restart your phone or tablet. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Install an APK of Google Play services </p>
<p> If these previous steps failed to resolve the problem with Google Play services and the app keeps stopping, there’s a way to work around it. What you can do is navigate to a third-party APK hub of a sort and download an older version of Google Play services. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to install an APK of Google Play services on your Android device: </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror, here, or any other websites that offer apps for sideloading. </p>
<p> Now, you can either go for the latest version of Google Play services or you can download an older one. We suggest downloading an older version, not older than 2 months. </p>
<p> Download the APK and run it. Once asked for permission to install apps from untrusted sources, make sure to grant it. </p>
<p> Install Google Play services and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reset your device to factory settings </p>
<p> And, finally, if none of the previous steps worked out for you, the only remaining solution we can recommend is resetting your device to factory settings. First, ensure that all your data is backed up and then proceed to reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset your device to factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and we hope that Google Play services are not stopping anymore. In case you have any questions or suggestions, we encourage you to post them in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-play-store-checking-updates" parent_folder="web1" id="file17841026" filename="google-play-store-checking-updates">
<p> Fix: Google Play Store keeps checking for updates </p>
<p> Google Play Store changed a lot since its introduction almost 12 years ago. And, being an essential part of the Android ecosystem, classic Android experience is unimaginable without the Store. Now, this app (it is an app at the end of the day) usually works without issues. However, recent user reports state that the Google Play Store keeps checking for updates. </p>
<p> Affected users usually encounter this error whenever they open the Play Store. We made sure to learn more about the problem and provide you with some applicable solutions in the list below. </p>
<p> Google Play Store says Error Checking for updates </p>
<p> There are multiple reasons why the Google Play Store keeps checking for updates. To fix it, we suggest clearing cache and data from the Store or uninstalling updates. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t help, there are a few more steps here you should try. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear cache and data from the Play Store </p>
<p> The first step to try is to clear the cache and data from the Play Store app within System Settings. Cached data might cause issues with the Play Store, especially if some significant changes are made to the Store recently via background updates. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from the Google Play Store: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Then open All apps or App Manager. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose to show system processes. </p>
<p> Locate the Google Play Store and open it. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> Clear cache first and then all data. </p>
<p> If the Google Play Store keeps checking for updates after this step, move to the next one. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check the network </p>
<p> The unstable network is usually not the primary reason for error like this one, but it’s worth checking it out. We’ll need you to ensure that your device is connected to a stable network. This can be tested within any other app that uses network connectivity (e.g. Chrome). </p>
<p> If your Wi-Fi network is not working properly, try these troubleshooting steps to fix it: </p>
<p> Disable and re-enable Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Disable VPN or Proxy. </p>
<p> Restart your device and router/modem. </p>
<p> Enable Airplane mode and disable it after a minute or so. </p>
<p> Reset the Network settings. </p>
<p> Additionally, if you are using Mobile Data to navigate through the Store and download/update apps, make sure to check the in-app Settings and allow Downloads over any network. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. If it doesn’t open, boot your device in Safe mode. To access the Safe mode, press the Power button. Tap and hold on the Reboot button until you get the Safe mode prompt. Then tap Safe mode and your device will restart without third-party apps and services. </p>
<p> Tap on the hamburger menu. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Under the App download preference, select Over any network. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reset the Google Play Store </p>
<p> If the previous steps failed to address the issue and the Google Play Store still keeps checking for updates, we recommend resetting the Google Play Store. On basically all stock ROMs out there, users can’t reinstall the Store. What you can do, on the other hand, is reset all updates and wait until it updates again on its own. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to reset the Google Play Store by uninstalling its updates: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > App Manager or Manage Apps > Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall updates and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Connect to a network and install updates again. </p>
<p> Look for improvements the next time you open the Store. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reset Google Play Services </p>
<p> Besides tackling the Google Play Store, you can also reset Google Play Services which are associated with the integration of all Google apps within the Android system. First, you should clear the cache and data. Alternatively, you can reset the app by uninstalling its updates. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cached data from Google Play Services or reset it by uninstalling updates: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Then, open App manager, Manage apps, or All apps (it depends on the phone’s OEM). </p>
<p> Once there, tap on the 3-dot menu and enable all system processes. This will add hidden system apps and services to the App list. </p>
<p> Now, locate Google Play Services entry and open it. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Finally, clear cache and data. </p>
<p> You can also try some of the steps we listed in this article dedicated to Google Play Services-related issues. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Sign out and sign in again with your Google Account </p>
<p> The next step to try if the issue persists is to log out of your Google Account (or remove it) and log in again. It’s a long shot but it won’t cost you anything to give it a try. Don’t forget to reboot your device after removing the Google Account but, prior to that, make sure to create a back up to Google Drive. </p>
<p> With that in mind, here’s how to remove and add Google Account on Android: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select Accounts. </p>
<p> Choose Google. </p>
<p> Remove Google Account and restart your device. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings > Accounts and sign in with your Google Account. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Reset your device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous solutions helped you out with the problem at hand, we can only suggest resetting your device to factory settings. This especially applies to users who started getting the error when upgrading to Android 10. Don’t forget to back up everything on your device before performing the factory reset. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to reset your Android device to factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> And, on that note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to tell us about alternative solutions or post questions about the ones we listed. You can share your thoughts in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix Google Play Store error 505 </p>
<p> The Google Play Store is the soul of the Android platform. The diversity and multitude of apps there allowed Android to take almost 90% of the mobile OS market. However, there are errors affecting the Google Play Store and undermining the foundation of Android. One of them goes by the code 505 and it prevents users from accessing the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing this or similar Google Play Store errors, we suggest checking the solutions we enlisted below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear data from the Google Play app and Google Play Services </p>
<p> Let’s start with the solution which usually helps to address all kinds of Google Play Store errors. Of course, first, try restarting your device and accessing the Google Play Store again. Then, try updating it with an APK file. You can find those here. Just don’t forget to navigate to Settings > Security, and enable installation from unknown sources. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t solve the problem, we’ll need you to clear all locally-saved data files from both the Google Play Store and Google Play Services. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Remove Google account and add it again </p>
<p> This is another viable solution to traverse the “505” error code. Resetting the Google account usually won’t get you far when it comes to troubleshooting, but there are some hints that in this case, it resolved the error. </p>
<p> Here’s how to remove and set up your Google account again: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Users & accounts. </p>
<p> Select the Google account. </p>
<p> Remove the Google account and restart your device. </p>
<p> Add your Google account again and try accessing the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Check the connection </p>
<p> What makes this error rather peculiar is that, for some users, it only appears when using a Wi-Fi network. It works just fine on a Mobile Data but that’s a mere workaround and not the permanent solution. </p>
<p> Although some affected users resolved it by disconnecting and re-connecting again to the same Wi-Fi network, this doesn’t apply to all. We suggest some additional network-related troubleshooting steps. </p>
<p> Here’s what to do to be secure your Wi-Fi network isn’t causing the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Restart your device and router. </p>
<p> Switch between the Wi-Fi and Mobile Data. </p>
<p> Remove the current network and re-establish it again. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> Switch between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz wireless frequencies. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check the date and time </p>
<p> All OS services depend on your regional time zone and date. If those are misconfigured, most of Android services won’t work as intended. So, in order to avoid that, we suggest you check your time and date settings and make sure they are properly set. The best way to avoid time discrepancy is to go with the Automatic settings. </p>
<p> Here’s how to enable them: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Tap Date & time. </p>
<p> Toggle on both Automatic date & time and Automatic time zone. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reset apps preferences </p>
<p> After the installation and the initial setup which includes granting access permissions, an app is ready for use. However, changes in some default, pre-installed apps might affect how the main Android services work. In order to avoid that possibility, we suggest resetting apps preferences to their default values. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Apps & notifications. </p>
<p> Open App apps. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Reset Google Play Store to factory values </p>
<p> If the current iteration of Google Play Store doesn’t fit your OS for some reason (and that seems to be the case for Marshmallow and older), you might as well reset it to factory settings. You won’t be able to keep it that way for too long, but this procedure is a reinstallation of a kind, as you can’t uninstall completely essential Android apps. It just might help you address the notorious 505 error. </p>
<p> Choose Apps & notifications. </p>
<p> Open All apps. </p>
<p> Restart your device and try accessing the Play Store again. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Reset your device to factory settings </p>
<p> In the end, you can wait it out for some time for Google to update the Store and address the issue. Of course, if you’re in a hurry, there’s still one thing you can do. </p>
<p> If the issue is persistent, the only remaining thing we can suggest is resetting your device to factory settings. The absence of fully-functional Google Play Store is a grave problem and this might be the only option remaining. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset your device to factory settings: </p>
<p> Select Settings. </p>
<p> Open System. </p>
<p> Choose Reset options. </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> That should do it. If you’re still bothered by the error code 505 in Google Play Store (or any other code, for that matter), share your questions or alternative solutions in the comments section. We’ll be pleased to hear from you. </p>

<p> Fix: Google Play Store keeps crashing on Android 11 </p>
<p> Google Play Store is the heart and soul of Android. It’s an integral part of the platform since the beginning and an irreplaceable puzzle-piece bringing the well-known user experience with millions of available apps. However, the significance of the Google Play Store makes even small issues quite troublesome. Users reported that Google Play Store keeps crashing on Android 11. </p>
<p> If you are among affected users, try to solve the problem by following the steps we provided below. </p>
<p> Why does my Google Play Store app keep closing? </p>
<p> 1. Clear cache and data from Google Play Store </p>
<p> Let’s start by clearing the locally-stored cache and data from the Google Play Store. There might be a problem caused by updating to Android 11. OTA updates of major upgrades are not always working as intended and can result in many issues. </p>
<p> So, the simplest way to tackle this is to start with removing cache and data from Google’s native Play Store. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Select All apps. </p>
<p> Navigate to Google Play Store. </p>
<p> 2. Clear cache and data from related system services </p>
<p> If the issue persists, there are a couple of essential services that are a crucial part of Android. Those two are Google Play Services and Google Services Framework. You’ll need to clear cache and data from those two services, as well. Hopefully, this will resolve the problem. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from related system services: </p>
<p> Repeat steps from the previous step until you get to All apps. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and tap Show system. </p>
<p> Navigate to Google Play Services and clear the storage. </p>
<p> Now, do the same for Google Services Framework. </p>
<p> Restart your device and check for improvements. </p>
<p> 3. Rollback to an older version of the Store </p>
<p> You can also disable and re-enable Google Play Store in Settings. Some users managed to resolve the issue that way. However, you can also navigate to APK Mirror and download an older version of the Google Play Store. That way, issues with the latest version can be avoided. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to do so: </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror’s Google Play Store section, here. </p>
<p> Download an older version of the Google Play Store. Make sure that the version you are downloading is present on Android 11. </p>
<p> Allow installation from external sources once prompted. </p>
<p> Install APK and restart your device. </p>
<p> If Google Play Store keeps crashing on Android 11, make sure to continue with the steps below. </p>
<p> 4. Sign out and sign in again with your Google Account </p>
<p> An alternative way to take on the problem is to sign out of your Google Account and sign-in again. Sometimes, the problem lies in the connected account and it should be addressed by removing the account and signing in again. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to sign out/sign in to your Google Account on your Android device: </p>
<p> Choose Accounts. </p>
<p> Tap on Google. </p>
<p> Tap Remove account. </p>
<p> 5. Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if Google Play Store keeps crashing on Android 11, we can only recommend resetting your device to factory settings. After that, the problem should stop appearing. As we already mentioned, major OTA updates often cause issues that even OEMs recommend resetting your device to factory settings after you move to a newer version of Android. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset your Android to factory settings in a few simple steps: </p>
<p> Back up your data to Google Drive or a PC. </p>
<p> Navigate again to Settings > System > Advanced and select Reset options. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data. </p>
<p> And, on that note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to reach us for additional help or share your thoughts. You can do so in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: Goole Play Store not opening </p>
<p> Goggle Play Store is an essential part of the Android platform. One of the main reasons Android got traction in the early days and reached this point of success today. Without it and millions of apps it has, the user experience would suffer. The reason more to worry if the Google Play Store is not opening for you, which I assume is exactly the case. </p>
<p> Don’t worry, though. We have a list of solutions that should help you address this with rather ease. </p>
<p> How do I fix the Google Play store not opening? </p>
<p> There’s a variety of causes and associated errors regarding the faulty Google Play Store. The most common reason is the abundance of pilled up data. Additionally, Google Play Store might not open due to inaccurate time and date, lack of permissions, or full-blown system corruption. </p>
<p> With these 9 steps, we made sure to tackle all possible causes. Move through the list and follow the instructions closely. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear the app data </p>
<p> Let’s start by clearing the app data. Even though it comes preinstalled as a system service, the Google Play Store is still an app. It piles up cache and data to speed the loading processes, but it actually gets slower once the stored data significantly grows. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear the app data from the Play Store: </p>
<p> Choose Apps and then Apps Manager or Manage apps. </p>
<p> Locate and tap the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and try accessing the Google Play Store again. </p>
<p> If the Google Play Store still won’t open, move to the next step. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Inspect the connection </p>
<p> The Play Store usually opens without the network connection if it’s cached in RAM. However, it won’t work without a stable Wi-Fi connection or Mobile Data. That’s why we encourage you to inspect the network, try connecting to an alternative one, or reboot your router. </p>
<p> Here are some tips to troubleshoot the connection on Android: </p>
<p> Disable and re-enable Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Restart your device and router/modem. </p>
<p> Enable Airplane mode and disable it after a minute or so. </p>
<p> Reset the Network settings. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear Data from Google Services Framework </p>
<p> If the Play Store still won’t open, we suggest clearing the date from the Google Services Framework. This is another essential part of the Android platform and has a big role in a lot of system functions. It is also known to break certain other Google services on Android devices. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to clear Data from Google Services Framework: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps and then Apps Manager or Manage apps. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and select Show system processes or All apps. </p>
<p> Choose Storage. </p>
<p> Clear Data and confirm when prompted. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and try accessing the Google Play Store again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check the Date & time settings </p>
<p> In case the system time or date is inaccurate, you won’t be able to use Google services. This, of course, includes the Play Store. What you need to do is disable and then re-enable the automatic time. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to set date and time automatically: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System or Additional settings. </p>
<p> Open Date & time. </p>
<p> Toggle OFF the “Use network-provided time” option. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Navigate to the same path and toggle the “Use network-provided time” again. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Remove and add your Google account again </p>
<p> Some users suggested a simple but effective solution. They were able to access the Google Play Store again after removing and then adding their Google Account again. This should resolve the issue completely. </p>
<p> Here’s how to remove and add your Google account again: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select Accounts. </p>
<p> Choose Google. </p>
<p> Remove Google Account and restart your device. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings > Accounts and sign in with your Google Account. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Disable proxy or VPN temporarily </p>
<p> The Google Play Store region options are usually not affected by VPN or proxy working in the background, switching DNS to an alternative. However, for the sake of troubleshooting, disable proxy or VPN and try accessing the Google Play Store again. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to disable VPN or proxy on your handset: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select Network (or VPN directly). </p>
<p> Disable VPN or Proxy and try accessing the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Check Play Store permissions </p>
<p> Even though the Play Store is a system app and it shouldn’t be affected by permissions like third-party apps, it’s still recommended to go to App settings and grant all permissions. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to grant permissions to the Google Play Store: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > App Manager or Manage Apps > Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Select Permissions. </p>
<p> Grant all permissions to Google Play Store. </p>
<p> In addition, some custom Android firmware (MIUI, EMUI, etc.) are quite restrictive and might kill off even system processes. Make sure to whitelist the Google Play Store in the Phone Manager. </p>
<p> Solution 8 – Uninstall Google Play Store updates </p>
<p> With most stock ROMs, you won’t be able to reinstall the Google Play Store. However, you can always uninstall all updates and restore the app to factory values. </p>
<p> That way, once the updates are readministered, you should be able to open the Google Play Store without issues. </p>
<p> Here’s how to remove Google Play Store updates: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > App Manager or Manage Apps > Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall updates and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Connect to a network and install updates again. </p>
<p> If you are still bothered by this issue, make sure to try the final step we provided below. </p>
<p> Solution 9 – Reset your device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, since the presence and functionality of the Google Play Store don’t have an alternative, you need to make it work. </p>
<p> The last solution we can recommend is to reset your device to factory settings. Just make sure to back up everything as all stored data will be deleted after the reset. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reset your Android handset to factory settings: </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> That should do it. After that, the Google Play Store should open and work as intended. Thank you for reading and tell us in the comments section below if this was of any help or share your solutions with the community. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-play-waiting-for-wi-fi" parent_folder="web1" id="file17842992" filename="google-play-waiting-for-wi-fi">
<p> Fix: Google Play Store stuck on “Google Play waiting for Wi-Fi” </p>
<p> If you’re an Android user, the device is hardly useful without Google Play Store. Downloading and updating apps is of the utmost importance, of course. It requires connection and it’ll inform you if fails to connect with the “Google Play is waiting for Wi-Fi” prompt. However, some users are seeing this prompt even though they can confirm both Wi-Fi and Mobile Data are working perfectly. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check your connection </p>
<p> Let’s start with a rather obvious troubleshooting step. This might be just another of those network issues, and we need to check it in order to confirm that there’s nothing wrong. Of course, we’ll look into both Wi-Fi and Mobile data (4G), as the reports state that neither of those works for Play Store. </p>
<p> Here are some steps we need you to follow: </p>
<p> Try using any other app which depends on connection. If everything is fine, move to Solution 2. If not, continue with the steps below. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Restart phone. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Play Store > Data usage and make sure Background Data is enabled. </p>
<p> Open Play Store and tap on the 3-line menu. Choose Settings and, under the App download preference, set Over any network and give it a try. Don’t forget to disable it later on to avoid data charges. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. Open Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset. </p>
<p> With that out of the table, let’s continue with the troubleshooting. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear Play Store data and cache </p>
<p> Just as any other Android app, Play Store app collects data and cache to speed up the loading speeds and retain your searches. However, piling up data on local storage can eventually lead to some bugs and errors. </p>
<p> That’s why we need you to clear all data and cache from the Play Store. Don’t worry, it won’t change a thing. </p>
<p> Open the Google Play Store app. </p>
<p> Choose Storage. </p>
<p> If the Store is persistent claiming you’re not connected, move to the next step. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reset Google Play Store </p>
<p> As you’re probably well aware, without flashing your phone, you won’t be able to uninstall pre-installed Google’s apps from your phone. This concerns Google Play Store and Play Services, especially. </p>
<p> What you can do, on the other hand, is reset it to default values. To a version which was pre-installed on your device at the time of the production. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Apps (Apps Manager). </p>
<p> Open the Google Play Store app. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and then Uninstall updates. It’ll ask you do you want to restore the app to factory values. Confirm you do and wait until everything is done. </p>
<p> Restart your handset and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Update Google Play Store </p>
<p> This can be more than helpful, especially if only the current version of the Play Store app is giving you a hard time. With that said, there’s only one effectual way to update Google Play Store with this error at hand. </p>
<p> And, for better or worse, it requires sideloading an up from the third-party source. The source is APKMirror, which is a safe and secure way to install official app releases. </p>
<p> Here’s how to update Google Play Store with a third-party APK: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Security. </p>
<p> Enable “Unknown sources”. This will allow you to install non-Store apps. </p>
<p> Download the latest version of Play Store to your device. </p>
<p> Open it and install APK. </p>
<p> Restart your device and check whether the “Google Play is waiting for Wi-Fi” error is re-appearing. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reset Google Play Services </p>
<p> Google Play Services is the vital part of every Android device. It grows larger over time, and the more apps you have the larger it’ll get. It mostly unifies all accounts and apps you’ve used those accounts to log into. This goes for the Play Store app, as well. </p>
<p> So, we suggest resetting Google Play Services. There are no drawbacks, except you might need to establish a certain account in some third-party apps. Also, don’t expect its size will reduce substantially. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Update your firmware </p>
<p> Finally, the only remaining thing we can recommend is updating your firmware. Some Xiaomi users reported that the updating the OS helped in this matter. Afterward, they were able to access the Play Store without any errors. </p>
<p> Choose Settings. </p>
<p> Select System update. </p>
<p> Tap Check for updates. </p>
<p> With that said, we can wrap it up. Don’t shy away from sharing your thoughts on this particular Play Store error, especially some alternative solutions we overlooked. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/google-play-wishlist" parent_folder="web1" id="file17846488" filename="google-play-wishlist">
<p> What is Google Play Wishlist and how to use it </p>
<p> The sheer abundance of digital content the Google Play Store offers makes it hard to keep track of all books, albums, apps, or games you like. And while you roam mindlessly through that multimedia content, chances are you’ll forget what you were looking for in the first place. </p>
<p> Luckily, there’s something like a digital shopping list in the Google Play Store. It’s called Wishlist and we made sure to explain how to take advantage of it. </p>
<p> How to use Google Play Wishlist </p>
<p> Let’s start with a random example based on my own experience. I’m really into the phone customization, with Nova Launcher and KWGT widgets. All that stuff. And, for an extended period of time, I’ve probably used around 50 custom icon packs offered on Play Store. I’ve paid for some, got others for free. </p>
<p> Finally, I ended up with the Whicons, a completely free white icon pack and ditched all others. Lots were nice but without timely updates. Mostly because developers gave up on those projects, and updates are quite important when it comes to icon packs. </p>
<p> Now, you may ask, what this has to do with Wishlist? Well, Google Pay on Play Store works in a particular way. You can purchase a certain app and refund it without issues in the first 24-hours period. But this works only once. </p>
<p> Next time you purchase that app, you won’t be able to ask for a refund. At least, not in this standard way. Contacting the developer is also an option. </p>
<p> So, I bought dozens of icon packs, tried them out and, after I’ve determined they don’t sit well on my wallpaper, I’ve asked for a refund. Then I added them to a Wishlist, so I’ll know which exact pack I’ve tried out. </p>
<p> So I won’t mistakenly purchase the same icon pack again. Why spend your money (albeit packs have a nominal price), on something you won’t use? </p>
<p> That’s only one useful way to use the Wishlist feature. If you are an avid reader or you prefer Google Play Music over some other streaming services, you can use Wishlist to keep track of every future purchase. Everything there is on Play Store can be added to Wishlist and inspected later on. Just look for the “Checkmark” icon beside the title. </p>
<p> But, ok, we explained what Wishlist in the Play Store is and how to use it to your advantage. Now we need to mention where to find it. Just open the Play Store app and tap on the hamburger menu in the top left corner. And there it is. Open Wishlist and choose what to do with the digital content you’ve added. You can access it on your PC as well, by following this link. </p>
<p> Albeit, there are no categories or order in the Wishlist, so if you keep on piling up apps or games, it can become cluttered quite fast. So, keep it tidy and it’ll prove quite a helpful tool. </p>
<p> Are you using Wishlist on a frequent basis? How can Google make Wishlist better? Tell us in the comments section below. </p>
<p> 1 COMMENT </p>
<p> wishlist could have an auto install function added for early access so that when it becomes availiable it starts the download and notifies you your wait for the app is now over and your now in access to that app. </p>

<p> Fix: ”Googlequicksearchbox:interactor can’t open at the moment” error on Huawei P9 </p>
<p> Huawei’s Android variation called EMUI is amazingly optimized software-wise. It suits all produced devices, starting from mid-budget phones and moving to flagships, like P9 or latest P10. </p>
<p> However, even though EMUI 4 and EMUI 5 are solid variations of Marshmallow and Nougat, there are some system infringements that caused issues for users lately. Certain users are frequently seeing the ”Googlequicksearchbox: interactor can’t open at the moment” error prompt that informs them about the specific Google Search issue while using the camera or 3rd-party apps. We’ll try to elaborate the reasons for this issue and tell you how to fix it in the list below. </p>
<p> Reasoning behind the error </p>
<p> Why this error occurs? There are multiple reasons, but our best bet is that Google Now and similar microphone-dependant pre-installed and 3rd-party apps are trying to use the microphone at the same time. So, for example, once you enter the camera and choose video or open Shazam to find yourself that catchy song, they collide with the Google voice features. That inflicts the error. Other possible reasons are: </p>
<p> corrupted third party app. </p>
<p> microphone software support failure. </p>
<p> corruption within Google services. </p>
<p> Two applications can’t use the microphone at the same time. Follow the solutions below and we should be able to resolve the problem together. </p>
<p> Update firmware </p>
<p> The first thing you can do is to check for firmware updates. Certain users reported that the problem occurred once they updated the OS. Luckily, P9 and P9 Lite are upgradable to Nougat, which (and we can tell you firsthand), works like a charm. So, make sure to check for updates and upgrade your device to EMUI 5.0. This should relieve you of the problem at hand. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open About Phone. </p>
<p> Choose System updates. </p>
<p> Check for updates. </p>
<p> If there’s an update available, make sure to download it. </p>
<p> Of course, this workaround applies only to users that have had issues with the above-mentioned error on Marshmallow. If you have had issues with this error on Nougat, check the further steps we enlisted below. </p>
<p> Clear the cache from troubled app and Google app </p>
<p> This error can and will occasionally affect all apps that use the microphone. And that’s a huge number. Starting from video recording on camera, instant messengers that can record voice messages, VoIP apps like Skype or Viber, and many others. Once you try to use the app for the sound recording or something similar, it will prompt you with the Google-related error that informs you that only one application can use the microphone at the moment. </p>
<p> After that, restart your device and check for changes. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app </p>
<p> Moreover, it’s a long shot but you can always try to reinstall the troubled app and that might resolve the problem at hand. We tried with the Shazam and it removed the issue for some time. So, it’s not exactly the solution, but you can give it a try and it might just work for you. </p>
<p> If you’re uncertain how to do it, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Open the App drawer or App menu. </p>
<p> Tap and draw the troubled app to the top and uninstall it. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for the app. </p>
<p> Install it. </p>
<p> Due to permission changes, there’s a chance that this will resolve the issue. If that’s not the case, there are still some troubleshooting steps you can try. </p>
<p> Restore Camera default settings </p>
<p> Just like in the 3rd-party app’s scenario, a similar remedy can be applied to a camera app. You can navigate to Settings > Apps, and clear the Camera cache, but that’s most of the time, not enough. A more fruitful approach is to reset Camera settings to default values. At least for some users that have solely issues within the Camera app on their Huawei handsets. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to restore the Camera settings to default values, and we’ll hopefully be in the clear: </p>
<p> Open the Camera app. </p>
<p> Swipe right. </p>
<p> Scroll to the bottom and tap Restore defaults. </p>
<p> Confirm selection. </p>
<p> Restart your device and try using the camera again. </p>
<p> Hopefully, once you start recording, the annoying message won’t appear again. </p>
<p> Refuse Google’s microphone permission </p>
<p> Another thing that you can do is to deny Google’s permission to access your microphone. By doing so, you’ll lose the option to use the Google Now and Google Assistant, but the interfering ‘Googlequicksearchbox: interactor can’t open at the moment” error will be subdued. Most of the users that turn to this solution provided positive reports, but it can be a problem for the other half that’s quite fond of the Google Assistant. Either way, it’s your choice. If you choose to decline the permission for Google to access your microphone, you can do it this way: </p>
<p> Open Permissions. </p>
<p> Choose Microphone. </p>
<p> Locate Google on the list and disable it. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you’re using Ok Google on daily basis, you might take an alternative into consideration. </p>
<p> Disable OK Google from any screen </p>
<p> As you probably know, you can reach Ok Google or Google Now in various ways. You can access it through the Google app, Google widget or, and this is the most popular way, with the ”Ok Google” voice command at any time. Now, this is more than handy and it gives an impression of true personal assistance. However, this is most certainly related to the error at hand. So, sadly, if you’re stuck with this error, the safest way to resolve it is to disable ”Ok Google from any screen”. You’ll at least be able to use it in alternative ways just like before. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to disable this feature and, hopefully, resolve the problem: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Disable Quick Calling </p>
<p> Additionally, some users suspected that Quick Calling feature may be the reason behind this error. It enables you to use the shortcut key (Volume Down key) and speak the name of the person from contacts you want to call. It’s great to call someone from the Lock Screen and it speeds up the calling process a lot. However, it also uses a microphone and, therefore it can interfere with Google or other 3rd-party and pre-installed features. </p>
<p> So, you may want to get rid of it and look for changes. To do so, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Smart Assistance. </p>
<p> Open Voice Control. </p>
<p> Disable Quick Calling. </p>
<p> If you’re still experiencing the problem, you may as well enable Quick Calling again and move to additional steps. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Now, it’s time for the big guns to come in play. If, after all of the previous steps, you’re still annoyed by the frequent appearance of this foul error, your possible solution bundle is depleted. There are only 2 viable steps you can take in this scenario, and one of those is to wipe cache partition. In comparison to factory reset, you won’t lose your data. </p>
<p> The procedure is a bit complex, so make sure to follow the instructions close: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> After that, you can look for changes. Hopefully, your issues will be history and you’ll be able to continue with the seamless use. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings </p>
<p> At the end, if nothing of the previously presented solutions fell short, there’s always a factory reset. Now, we’re aware that it sounds harsh but, by using the Huawei’s HiSuite, you can finish the procedure fast and restore all the deleted data in a matter of minutes. Follow the instructions below to perform a factory reset that way. </p>
<p> Connect your device and the drivers should install automatically on your PC and phone. </p>
<p> Click on Backup to backup all your data. </p>
<p> You can put the encryption and password protection on your backup. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> Re-connect your device with the PC and start HiSuite. </p>
<p> Choose Restore. </p>
<p> Select the latest backed up save and import all settings and data back to your phone. </p>
<p> That should do it. We hope that at least one of these proved valuable and that the ‘Googlequicksearchbox: interactor can’t open at the moment” error is long gone. Don’t forget to tell us about your experience and ask a question in the comments section below. We’ll be glad to help you. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Fix: Google Translate camera not working on Android </p>
<p> Google Translate is one of the most useful services Google offers to its vast group of users. It got so powerful in recent years that things like a live translation with your camera are actually possible. However, some users reported that Google Translate Camera is not working on Android. They are getting the error code 807 when accessing the camera. </p>
<p> If you are among them, find a way to solve this in the list we provided below. </p>
<p> Google Translate camera feature not working </p>
<p> 1. Check Google Translate permissions </p>
<p> The first thing you should do is check all necessary permissions Translate requires in order to utilize various features. In this case, the focus is on permission to access the camera. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps and notifications. </p>
<p> Select All apps. </p>
<p> Locate and open Google Translate from the list of available apps. </p>
<p> Choose Permissions. </p>
<p> Make sure that the Camera permission is granted to Google Translate. For the sake of troubleshooting, grant all permissions and check for improvements. </p>
<p> 2. Clear app’s cache and data </p>
<p> The next thing you can do is clear cache and data from the Google Translate app. There’s a slight chance that the locally-stored files got corrupt and the best way to solve it is to wipe them. Follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Again, navigate to Settings > Apps and notifications > All apps > Google Translate. </p>
<p> Select Storage. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data and reboot your device. </p>
<p> 3. Reinstall Google Translate </p>
<p> Alternatively, you should give reinstallation a try. That worked for some users who got Google Translate Camera working after downloading the latest version of Google Translate from the Play Store. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Tap & hold on the Google Translate on Home Screen or in the app drawer. </p>
<p> Drag it to the top and uninstall it. </p>
<p> Now, navigate to Play Store and install Google Translate again. </p>
<p> Grant it all permissions and give Google Translate Camera another go. </p>
<p> 4. Rollback to an older version with an APK </p>
<p> Timely updates and upgrades are always welcome but, in the act of advancement, a few nasty bugs can show their heads. Google is seemingly aware of the bug but, until they resolve it, you can try rolling back to an older iteration of Google Translate. Follow the steps below to install an older APK of Google Translate: </p>
<p> Uninstall Google Translate. </p>
<p> Open a browser of your choice on your mobile and navigate, here. </p>
<p> Download any other previous version. Now, we don’t want to back to much, so stick to recent versions. </p>
<p> Allow installation from third-party sources. </p>
<p> Install the app and look for improvements. </p>
<p> 5. Use Google Lens temporarily </p>
<p> Finally, if Google Translate Camera is not working on your Android, you can download and use Google Lens temporarily. Recently, Google Lens got Translation support which might come in handy. </p>
<p> With that said, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share your thoughts with us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> How to fix frequent crashes in Hearthstone on iOS </p>
<p> Hearthstone is one of the most popular multi-platform games today. If you’re into card collecting and online competitive matches, this is the game you should give a try. </p>
<p> Since this game can be played on most platforms available at the moment, besides the PC/Mac, you can play Hearthstone on the move on your smartphone or tablet. The games is a fan favorite on iOS but it’s not without issues. One of the fundamental issues that seem to occur frequently is crashing. For that purpose, we prepared some of the solutions that may help you enjoy the game without annoying crashes. </p>
<p> If your Hearthstone in iOS is crashing, check the list below. </p>
<p> How to resolve Hearthstone crashes on iOS </p>
<p> Meet the system requirements </p>
<p> The first step you should take before playing the game is to check the system requirements. Some of the PC games can be forced to start on the lackluster specs, but that’s not the case for the handheld devices. So, make sure you have the required device with the demanded iOS version before downloading the game in the firs place. </p>
<p> iOS specs for Hearthstone: </p>
<p> Supported devices: iPad® Air™ or newer, iPad® 4 or newer, iPad® mini™ 2 or newer, iPhone® 5 or newer, iPod Touch® 6 or newer. </p>
<p> Supported iOS version: iOS 6.0 or later. </p>
<p> Check the connection </p>
<p> Allegedly, the main reason for this bug is the connection problem. Namely, after the latest update, you’ll game will crash if the connection is unstable or weak. That will result in the lost matches most of the time. In order to prevent that, make sure to follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Use exclusively stable Wi-Fi to play the game rather than mobile data. </p>
<p> Make sure that the Wi-Fi connection is stable. Public Wi-Fi is not always suitable for Arena matches. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Reset the Network settings. </p>
<p> Don’t touch minimized cards </p>
<p> On the other hand, this isn’t the only bug at hand. The update generated a lot of issues and iOS players are quite stressed about it. Another bug that causes crashes is related to the gameplay itself. Namely, it seems that after the players touch minimized cards, the game suddenly crashes. </p>
<p> Because of that, the simplest way to overcome this issue is to keep your hands off the minimized cards. Blizzard has promised a resolution, but until it finally occurs, don’t touch those cards. </p>
<p> Update the app </p>
<p> It’s a bit generic workaround, but it’s still no less important. If your app isn’t up to date, there’s a chance that the game will crash on its own. In addition, some of the issues may be resolved with the latest update. If auto-update option is enabled, the game should be up to date. However, it’s worth checking manually just in case something went wrong. </p>
<p> This is how to update Hearthstone on your iOS device: </p>
<p> Tap App Store. </p>
<p> Tap Updates. </p>
<p> If the Hearthstone is on the list, tap to update it. </p>
<p> There were cases where the users were unable to download and install Hearthstone update. For that, you can check the next step. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app </p>
<p> If the current version you’re running is not known for frequent crashes, you may have an individual problem. And what is better for resolving app hardships than a reinstallation. Now, follow these instructions to reinstall the Hearthstone app from a scratch: </p>
<p> Tap X to uninstall the app. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Open App Store and search for Hearthstone. </p>
<p> This should provide you with the latest version of the app. </p>
<p> At the end, if that wasn’t helpful and your app is still crashing, there’s only one solution you can turn to… </p>
<p> Wait for the updates to resolve it </p>
<p> Like many other excellent games/apps, developers from time to time have the custom to wreak havoc with the updates. Same goes for Hearthstone on iOS. But, if they are to be believed to, the upcoming patches should fix a multitude of issues, including the crashes we are addressing today. So, if you’re able to run the game on other systems, we advise you to put the iOS version on hold. </p>
<p> They should fix it eventually. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. In case you have some questions or suggestions of any kind, give us a shout in the comments section. We’ll be thankful. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/hidden-instagram-filters" parent_folder="web1" id="file17847037" filename="hidden-instagram-filters">
<p> How to enable hidden Instagram filters </p>
<p> Instagram basically devoured Snapchat with the implementation of Story, Boomerang, and augmented face filters. Now, this isn’t just a social network for capturing and sharing the photos, it grew to become much more. However, with all these new features, people kind of forgot about the good old filters that were the main attraction when Instagram emerged as a leading photo-sharing social network a couple of years ago. </p>
<p> Instagram filters are still popular and many of 700 million users use them on daily basis. However, many of those users are not using the full list of available filters. Probably because they’re hidden and you need to enable them in order to filter your photos. That’s the case because the developers tried to keep the Filters list uncluttered and thus they hid less popular filters. </p>
<p> On the other hand, it’s good to know that you have a dozen more filters when you need to express the special nuance of that nature portrait or to add a retro look on your selfie. Maybe little something you were missing is right there, within the abandoned filters. And you won’t have to turn to third-party apps to edit your photos. </p>
<p> For that purpose, follow the instructions below to enable additional, hidden filters: </p>
<p> Open Instagram app. </p>
<p> Click + to add a new photo. </p>
<p> Once you’ve taken the photo or have chosen one from the Gallery, tap Next. </p>
<p> On the Filter screen, scroll right until you reach the Manage button. </p>
<p> Tap Manage and enable all filters manually. </p>
<p> Now you can roam through filters and decide which to keep and which to disable. </p>
<p> That’s it. And don’t forget to update Instagram app frequently in order to get new filters. It’s just a question of time before Instagram takes every possible trait from other photo-related apps, so fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride. </p>
<p> If you have something on your mind, feel free to ask in the comments section below. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> FIx: Honor 8 SMS messages disapear in Android Nougat </p>
<p> Huawei Honor 8 is a high-end device with an amazing design that’s still worth your money even though it’s successor is on the way. One thing going for it is the well-optimized and clean Android Nougat version that Honor 8 received a few months ago. </p>
<p> However, besides the standard issues, we already covered in this article, there’s another distinctive problem that appeared after the system upgrade to EMUI 5.0. Namely, some users reported that their SMS messages are missing from the inbox under the default system app. That can be quite a pain since you can’t keep the track of your conversations. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we thought that is important to list some of the possible solutions in order to help you prevent the messages from disappearing. If you have exact or similar issues, follow the steps below. </p>
<p> Restart your phone </p>
<p> First troubleshooting step you should take is always reset. It may strike you as an obvious move, but the restart can frequently resolve some of the minor, peculiar issues that are rare but not less annoying. This is how to restart your Honor 8 easily: </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Tap Restart. </p>
<p> Navigate to the Messages app, send an SMS and look for changes. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there and the messages keep on disappearing, move down with your troubleshooting. </p>
<p> Restore default messaging settings </p>
<p> If there’s even the slightest chance that the update changed your default settings, you should look out for changes. Namely, some of the settings can affect the app’s behavior, and thus inflict an uncalled bug like this. You can easily retrieve the default settings by following these steps: </p>
<p> Tap Messaging app. </p>
<p> Tap 3-dot More menu at the bottom and open Settings. </p>
<p> Select Restore Default Settings at the bottom of the screen. </p>
<p> Restart your phone and check for changes. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if something greater is inflicting the bug, make sure to check the other workarounds presented below. </p>
<p> Clear App’s Data </p>
<p> Since the Huawei’s default messaging app can’t be uninstalled, you can at least clear it’s cache and data. Due to changes inflicted with the upgrade to EMUI 5.0, app-related files can cause malfunctions of different kinds. Follow these instructions to clear the Cache and Data on Honor 8: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Apps. </p>
<p> Navigate to Messaging app and tap to open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Tap Clear Cache and Clear Data. </p>
<p> Restart your phone and look for changes. </p>
<p> Set as Default messaging app </p>
<p> Another thing worth addressing is the default app priority. Namely, some other apps may retrieve sent/received messages instead of the default messenger. Because of that, make sure to set the Messaging app as the default and check for changes. This is how to set the Messaging app as the default SMS/MMS client: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Apps. </p>
<p> Find and tap on the Messaging app to summon Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Default SMS app. </p>
<p> Under Default Apps, tap Default app settings. </p>
<p> Open Messaging and toggle the Messaging app as the Default. </p>
<p> Update your device </p>
<p> The future system updates are confirmed for most of the Huawei flagship devices and Honor 8 isn’t an exception. So, we hope that the EMUI 5.1 is coming soon and it may solve your messaging issues. Once the system update becomes available you’ll be timely prompted, but it doesn’t hurt to check for the updates on your own from time to time. This is how to check for updates on Honor 8: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Navigate to System update at the bottom of the list. </p>
<p> Open System update and tap on Check For Updates. </p>
<p> If the updates are available, tap Download & Install. </p>
<p> If the problem isn’t gone, you can certainly perform the factory reset, but that’s the last resort and it can cost you a lot of time and nerves. But, if you are keen to repair your messages, you can find the detailed explanation in this article. </p>
<p> Use an alternative app </p>
<p> The last thing that’s not the solution but merely an advice is related to the alternative apps. You can use various Instant Messengers to send and receive SMS/Text messages by setting them as the default SMS client. The best suited for the job is Google Messanger, but you can choose any other. And when we say other, we mean any other besides the Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. This is an unusual but quite nerve-breaking bug and we hope you managed to fix it with the presented steps. Either way, don’t hesitate to post questions or suggestions. The comments section is just below. </p>
<p> 3 COMMENTS </p>
<p> Interesting you say to change the default SMS app for something else. Well I did and the messages are still disappearing about two seconds of ‘view time’. I now use Android Messages and the problem didn’t go away. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/honor-play-common-issues-and-how-to-resolve-them" parent_folder="web1" id="file17846725" filename="honor-play-common-issues-and-how-to-resolve-them">
<p> Honor Play common issues and how to resolve them </p>
<p> The subsidiary of Huawei, Honor, is doing an amazing job in the midrange class of smartphones. Besides the Honor series, they recently introduced this gaming-specialized smartphone with all the goodies an avid mobile gamer needs. With more than capable chipset, spacious and bright display, and large battery, the Honor Play is one of the best midrange devices in this newly-popularized gaming segment. </p>
<p> It’s not flawless, though. Some minor issues occur here and there and we made sure to enlist the common ones found online and provide you with applicable solutions. </p>
<p> 1: Overheating </p>
<p> Let’s start with the most-posted issue we found online. And that’s the overheating. The Honor Play is a gaming smartphone with a remarkable set of specs and above-average cooling system. However, that doesn’t mean that it’s completely invulnerable to heat, especially after prolonged gaming sessions. </p>
<p> In addition, using your handset for extensive gaming while it’s charging is never advised. This might lead to major problems, especially if you make it a habit. However, some users reported this problem after the system update, so there might be some software bug involved as well. </p>
<p> If you’re not sure how to reduce the overheating on the Honor Play, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Don’t use your device while charging. </p>
<p> Remove the casing if you’re doing heavy gaming. Yup, PUBG falls into that category. </p>
<p> Reduce the in-game graphics. </p>
<p> Disable GPU Turbo. </p>
<p> If the problem started after an update, reset your device to factory settings and restore it from a backup. </p>
<p> 2: Camera glitches </p>
<p> Huawei and its subsidiary Honor are not quite famous for the timely software updates. But, the larger concern lies in the negative impact some of those late-coming updates have on their respective devices. Some users reported strange camera glitches and pop-ups informing them about the Aperture mode. </p>
<p> In regards to glitches, we must remind you that EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) might be slower than usual in the low-light surroundings. On the other hand, if the problem is persistent, we suggest following these steps to try and address it: </p>
<p> Reset Camera settings to default values. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Test the camera in the Safe Mode. </p>
<p> 3: Phone lagging </p>
<p> The Kirin 970 CPU, Mali G72 GPU and 4 GB of RAM should be enough not only to make the overall Android experience snappy but to run all demanding mobile games on ultra settings. That’s why we’re almost certain that any lags experienced by users are probably due to software issues. </p>
<p> With that in mind, here are some steps which should help you fix lagging on the Honor Play: </p>
<p> Clear cache with the Phone Manager. </p>
<p> Disable some intensive applications from the Phone Manager. Some apps you don’t need working in the background might slow down the performance. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 4: Screen flickers </p>
<p> Now, as we already said on multiple instants, the errors and bugs we enlist are rarely a widespread issue or the manufacturing oversight. Most of the handsets pass the rigorous tests before finding their way to an end-user. </p>
<p> The 6.3-inch IPS display on the Honor Play is great, on par with some much more expensive devices. However, some users reported flickers, especially in third-party apps. </p>
<p> Of course, our main suspect is the app itself and not the display, so we suggest following the steps we enlisted below: </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from the affected app. </p>
<p> Lower the animation scaling from 1x to 0.5x in Developer Options. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 5: SIM fails </p>
<p> Hybrid Dual SIM option on the Honor Play allows you to use either 2 micro SIM cards or 1 SIM card + microSD storage extension. Your usual setup on most of the contemporary phones. However, some users reported that their SIM card fails to initialize after the restart. </p>
<p> If that’s the case for you, too, do try these steps to fix it: </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Make sure that the SIM card is properly placed in its compartment. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Contact your service provider, the SIM might be faulty. </p>
<p> Reset the Honor Play to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6: No notifications </p>
<p> This is something which, sadly, isn’t uncommon for Huawei and Honor devices (EMUI-powered devices). The process management is frequently too aggressive and it kills off apps from working in the background. Unless you whitelist them in Phone Manager settings. That’s why some users can’t get notifications. </p>
<p> You should be able to address this by following these steps: </p>
<p> Open Phone Manager. </p>
<p> Choose the Lock Screen cleanup. </p>
<p> Whitelist all necessary apps. </p>
<p> Now, navigate to Settings > Apps and allow notifications for all needed apps individually. </p>
<p> 7: Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> Bluetooth connectivity is another issue we can’t avoid mentioning. These kinds of issues are quite common but don’t forget that the Bluetooth pairing is a two-way street and that a lot of issues might be ascribed to a second device. </p>
<p> The Honor Play case is similar to all others: the Bluetooth either fails to pair or it suddenly disconnects. </p>
<p> If you’re unable to fix this by simply restarting your device, try one of these steps: </p>
<p> Unpair devices and try pairing them again. </p>
<p> Check the second device. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi and Mobile Data temporarily. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> 8: Battery drainage and frequent power-intensive prompts </p>
<p> It’s a bit unexpected for a battery to drain on a Huawei device, especially in the idle mode. However, a few reports state that their battery life and SoT (Screen-on Time) dropped substantially, especially after a firmware update. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to improve your battery life: </p>
<p> Disable Mobile Data always on in Developer Options. </p>
<p> Prevent unnecessary apps from working in the background with the built-in Phone Manager. </p>
<p> On the other hand, some users were annoyed by frequent power-intensive prompts informing them that certain third-party apps are too heavy on the battery. This can be disabled with ease and here’s how: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery. </p>
<p> Choose Settings (the cog-like icon in the top right corner). </p>
<p> Toggle Power-intensive prompt off. </p>
<p> 9: Slow charging </p>
<p> The handset comes with the Quick Charger which isn’t exactly a top of the line but should be able to fill in the battery from 0 to 100% in 90 minutes. However, due to a different output of two chargers (it comes either with 9V or 5V), you might wait for an hour more. </p>
<p> The problem here is that some proud owners of the Honor Play wait for much more for their device to fully charge, which isn’t supposed to be the case. There’s an explanation for that, too. Namely, the fast charging automatically switches to slow variant to avoid overheating. </p>
<p> However, if your problem is a bit more serious than that, consider replacing the charger cord. </p>
<p> 10: Background light issue </p>
<p> This is a minutia error reported by a few users so it’s hardly something which should affect a general public. Namely, the problem at hand concerns the background lightning which suddenly turns off while the device is idle. This should be the case only during the calls, but some users stated that the display shuts even during the standard usage. </p>
<p> This, like so many other issues from the list, we can safely ascribe to a firmware update. For that reason, your best bet to address it is to factory reset your device. </p>
<p> 11: Slow Wi-Fi and no 4G/LTE </p>
<p> The final spot is reserved for another connectivity issues. Some reports state that the Wi-Fi is too slow, while others have issues with enabling 4G/LTE on the Honor Play. Both problems should be resolved by resetting the network settings. </p>
<p> If that won’t help, and if we assume that the hardware isn’t an issue, the factory reset should resolve all issues. However, in regards to 4G, make sure that your SIM card and service provider support 4G before resetting the device. </p>
<p> 12: Advanced Troubleshooting steps for the Honor Play </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap System. </p>
<p> Select About phone. </p>
<p> Get back to System and there you should see Developer options. </p>
<p> Reset the Honor Play to factory settings </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> That’s it. If you have anything to add or take from the list, do us a favor and post your valuable feedback in the comments section below. </p>

<p> How to backup photos in Android </p>
<p> Whether you’re a passionate mobile photographer (yes, that’s a thing), or you just take snaps occasionally, there’s no denying taking photos plays an important part in your daily smartphone use. </p>
<p> Thanks to the ever-advancing technology, the quality of photos you take with your smartphone has significantly gone up. That gives us amazing shots, you wouldn’t believe were taken with a smartphone just a few years back. But the quality comes with a cost, and you’re paying it with storage space. It’s normal for pictures today to take up to tens of megabytes of your storage. And no matter how much storage space your phone has, you’ll eventually run out of it. </p>
<p> That’s where backing up your photos to a cloud comes to rescue. Not only that you’ll free up an enormous chunk of the storage space, but you’ll also protect your photos from being accidentally deleted. And the fact that you can access your pictures from any synced device only counts as a plus. </p>
<p> Since you’re using an Android phone, backing up your photos has never been easier. If you’re a fan of Google products, you can go with Google Photos, which is the simplest and most convenient way of keeping your photos in check. Especially if your phone comes with Google Photos pre-installed. </p>
<p> If you prefer some other cloud storage service, like Dropbox, no problem! Backing up your photos is still fairly simple. These are all cloud storage services, so the principle basically stays the same. </p>
<p> Use Google Photos </p>
<p> The best way to use Google Photos is to enable automatic upload. That will allow you to completely forget about backing up your pictures and videos, as each photo or video you take will be automatically uploaded to the cloud within seconds. </p>
<p> All you have to do to enable this feature is to open Google Photos. If you don’t have Google Photos installed on your phone, download it from the Play Store. As soon as you open the app, it will ask you to enable Backup & sync. Just confirm, and you’re good to go. Now, each photo/video you take with your camera will be automatically uploaded to Google Photos. </p>
<p> There are a few additional settings you can tweak. For example, you can choose the quality of uploaded photos. Google provides unlimited storage for High-quality photo uploads. You can also choose to upload photos in the original size. For this option, you have a limited storage space of 12GB. You don’t need to sacrifice storage space for the quality here, because even if you opt for High-quality uploads instead of the original size, the difference is almost unnoticeable, so you don’t have to worry about losing the quality of your photos. </p>
<p> The default settings only work for the photos you take with your camera. However, if you want to back up other phots, like screenshots or downloads, just enable the sync for these folders as well, and you’re good to go. To do that, just open Google Photos, go to Albums, tap the folder you want to back up, and enable Back up & sync. </p>
<p> That’s about it. All your photos are backed up now, and safe from accidental deletion. And you’ll have much more storage space, as well. </p>
<p> I’d recommend you to go with Google Photos for all your backups. But since it all comes down to personal preference, you can do the same thing with other cloud storage services, if you like. It’s up to you. </p>
<p> Note: This article is a part of our Google Photos coverage. If you want to learn more Google Photos tips and tricks, or you have a certain problem with this app, visit our Google Photos Hub for more content. </p>
<p> Use Dropbox </p>
<p> If you use Dropbox as your go-to cloud storage, backing up photos and videos is as easy as in Google Photos. All you have to do is to open the Dropbox app, go to Photos, and tap Enable camera uploads. </p>
<p> Now, each time you take a photo with your camera, it will automatically be uploaded to Dropbox. Screenshots also fall into this category, as Dropbox will sync all your screenshots, as well. This, however, doesn’t work for other photos, like downloads, as you’ll have to upload those manually. If you want to upload videos, just go to Settings > Camera uploads, and enable Upload video. </p>
<p> Just keep in mind that, unlike Google Photos, Dropbox doesn’t offer an unlimited storage option. You have 2GB of free storage, while additional storage space must be purchased. So, keep the limit in mind. </p>
<p> That’s about it. As I already mentioned, you don’t have to use Google Photos or Dropbox for backing up your photos. I just mentioned these two, because they’re the most popular options. But just about any cloud storage service will do. </p>
<p> If you have any questions regarding backing up your photos using other services, feel free to ask in the comments below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/how-to-clear-cache-data-in-android-9-pie" parent_folder="web1" id="file17845602" filename="how-to-clear-cache-data-in-android-9-pie">
<p> How to clear Cache data in Android 9 Pie </p>
<p> The good old caching problem continues in Android 9 Pie. Long gone are the days when you were able to clear the complete cache data piled up in your memory with just a few taps. Now, clearing the cache requires more (and if you ask me, unnecessary) effort. </p>
<p> It all started in Android 8 Oreo, when Google re-modeled the cache-clearing mechanism in Android. Namely, Oreo removed the ability to bulk remove the complete cache data, as you had to go through each app’s settings and clear the cache individually. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, that trend continues with Android 9 Pie. You’re still limited to clearing the cache for each app individually, and that doesn’t seem to change anytime soon. In fact, Google hasn’t made any significant changes to the caching system compared to Android 8. </p>
<p> But, even if your options are limited, I’m going to show you two ways of clearing cached data in Android 9 Pie. Of course, each way has its own compromises, so you can choose which one suits you better. </p>
<p> Clear the cache individually </p>
<p> You can, of course, clear the cache the way it’s meant to be cleared in Android Pie. And that’s by going to each app’s individual settings page and clearing the cached data. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Apps & notifications </p>
<p> Tap See all (x) apps </p>
<p> Now, tap the app you want to clear the cache of </p>
<p> And that’s pretty much the pattern you have to repeat for each app. There are a few exceptions, like Google Chrome or Spotify, that allow you to clear the cache in-app. </p>
<p> Bonus: Use Files by Google </p>
<p> If you want to save some more storage space, try Files by Google app. This is Google’s own app for managing storage on Android devices. So, technically it’s not even a third-party app. It just doesn’t come pre-installed like some other services. </p>
<p> Although Files by Google can’t clear the cached data all at once, it will free you of the accumulated junk files, which is sometimes as good as clearing the cache itself. It just requires installing one additional app. But when you look at the effort this app saves you, it’s definitely worth it. </p>
<p> Here’s how to clear the cache in Android 9 Pie using the Files by Google app: </p>
<p> Tap the three dots again, and go to Delete junk files. </p>
<p> Files by Google is a great tool for managing the Storage on your phone in General, not just clearing the cache data. It allows you to delete other junk files, duplicate files, unused apps, and more. So, you should definitely take some time to explore this handy app. </p>
<p> That’s about it. As you can see, clearing the cached data in Android Pie requires more effort than it maybe needs to, but you don’t really have a choice. If you have any comments or questions, just write them down below. </p>

<p> The ability to batch clear the /cache partition.in Android 8.0.0, and newer versions, was not “removed” per se. Rather, due to major changes in the Android open source code, Android Oreo and newer versions no longer use an actual /cache partition. Hence, an option to batch clear the /cache is not even possible since app cache data is no longer stored within a single /cache partition. Moreover, this newer protocol is much more efficient than the pre-Oreo caching method and alleviates the need to have an entire partition dedicated to the storage of cache junk files. For the most part,… Read more » </p>
<p> What a misleading article, please take the time to write clear decent articles, I wasted my time reading your click bait just to determine that you provided me ONE way to clear the cache and another way to delete junk files (WHICH IS NOT CLEARING CACHE FILES!!!). You stated at the beginning of this article “But, even if your options are limited, I’m going to show you two ways of clearing cached data in Android 9 Pie.”, blatant lie, get your shit together! </p>

<p> O.M.G. YOU FLIPPING ROCK HARD! This helped me with fixing an app that would not load AT ALL. I would not have known about Files By Google. Now that will be my go to for choosing the files to see if that’s an issue. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! </p>
<p> Helped me! Finally. Thanks! In Android 9, Settings >> Storage though the total didn’t go down but will use this killer feature in future and experiment. Awesome article! All the Google play store apps to do this are outdated by two or more years ugh. </p>

<p> After clearing junk files, I chose one of the apps and looked at it from the Android system preferences and it still had caches… Junk data isn’t the same thing as cached data. </p>
<p> Agree. This didn’t delete the cache. I suspect that Google have disabled the cache option for marketing purposes. A real step backward for the user. </p>

<p> How to edit videos in Google Photos </p>
<p> If you’re an Android user and an avid photographer, chances are you’re using Google Photos as your main photo backup and organization tool. Chances are, also, that besides your photos, all kinds of videos will find their way in Google Photos gallery. </p>
<p> In comparison to photo editing, you won’t find an abundance of options for videos. In-depth video editing might require more advanced tools. However, for minor changes, Google Photos should suffice. That’s why we took some time to expand on this subject and explain how to edit your videos in Google Photos. </p>
<p> Let’s start by saying that video editing features are solely available in the Google Photos app. Which means that you won’t be able to apply changes like stabilization, rotation or cuts to videos in Google Photos for Web. </p>
<p> So, the options you have at your disposal are, as said above, the following: </p>
<p> Stabilize — stabilizes shaky videos. </p>
<p> Rotate — allows you to change the video’s original orientation to portrait or landscape and vice versa. </p>
<p> Cut — lets you shorten the video by cutting it on a particular frame. </p>
<p> Edit videos </p>
<p> You can access video editing by following these steps: </p>
<p> Open the Google Photos app on your handset. </p>
<p> Tap Albums and select Videos. </p>
<p> Open the video you want to edit and tap on the middle icon which translates to Edit. </p>
<p> Now, you can tap “Stabilize” or “Rotate”. Also, you can drag the sliders positioned at the beginning and end of the video frame line to cut the portion of the video. </p>
<p> After you’ve applied changes, just tap Save and you’re good to go. </p>
<p> Add soundtrack </p>
<p> In addition, you can use a single video (or multiple videos) and create a Movie. This allows you to add a soundtrack of your choice to a video. Which, based on your preferences and type of the footage, might come quite handy. </p>
<p> Tap Movie. </p>
<p> Tap My music and add a fitting song as a background track. Or you can go with the variety of theme music tracks provided by Google Photos. </p>
<p> That should do it. With hope this was an informative read, we encourage you to share your feedback in the comments section below. We’ll be glad to hear from you. </p>
<p> Note: This article is a part of our Google Photos coverage. If you want to learn more Google Photos tips and tricks, or you have a certain problem with this app, visit our Google Photos Hub for more content. </p>
<p> I have not tried that feature yet… but I did just try to use the slider feature. . And it did not cut that portion if my video out 🙁 grrr… frustrating </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/how-to-fake-location-on-android" parent_folder="web1" id="file17841631" filename="how-to-fake-location-on-android">
<p> How to fake location on Android </p>
<p> There are multiple reasons why one would want to hide their current location or fake it to mimic any other location around the globe. There are multiple benefits, especially in accessing content that is not permitted in your region. If you want to learn how to fake location on Android, we have a detailed list instruction, with 3 different methods. </p>
<p> How can I set a fake location in Android? </p>
<p> Method 1: Use a mock location </p>
<p> Let’s start with the simplest of ways to replace location provided by GPS readings with any mock location of your preference. </p>
<p> This is especially useful for certain apps, while it won’t work at all with others that can identify the fake GPS app running in the background. In order to use the Mock location, you’ll need to access Developer options on your device. </p>
<p> In addition, you’ll need to use a third-party app as the mock location app. There’s a variety of available apps that spoof location. Just to showcase the procedure, we’ll be using Fake GPS Location that can be found on the Play Store. </p>
<p> Once you get the app and add it as the Mock app in Developer options, you should be able to fake your location with ease. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to use the Mock location app to fake your current GPS location: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > System > About phone. This path might differ based on your device. </p>
<p> Locate the Build number and tap on it 7 times in order to enable Developer options access. </p>
<p> Once you’ve enabled Developer options, get back to System and open Developer options there (again, the path might be different on different Android ‘skins’). </p>
<p> Tap Select mock location app. </p>
<p> Choose Fake GPS Location. </p>
<p> Open the app and select the GPS location you want. </p>
<p> That’s it. Try a weather app or some other location-dependent app to confirm that the fake location is the one actually recognized. </p>
<p> Method 2: Use a VPN or Proxy </p>
<p> Although this isn’t fully related to GPS but rather to your IP address, there are plenty of advantages of using a VPN service to fake your location. Besides accessing the geo-restricted content, VPN or Proxy will protect your privacy while online. </p>
<p> We highly recommend using NordVPN that not only offers complete VPN functionality for 6 devices, but it works astonishingly well on Android and it also brings password manager. Hiding IP address with VPN like NordVPN is a walk in a park. </p>
<p> Once you’ve downloaded the app and signed in, the only thing remaining is to choose the location that you want to use in order to mimic your internet address. </p>
<p> Check our NordVPN and learn about its many advantages, here. It’s currently on a sale and we encourage you to get it if you need a reliable, solid VPN solution. Just make sure to inform before pledging your money into the VPN subscription. </p>
<p> Method 3: Go far and beyond to set a fake location on Android </p>
<p> Finally, if you really need to completely fake your location on an Android device, there awaits a lot of effort. People online will usually suggest just a VPN or just a GPS spoofing method but most system apps won’t get tricked by that. </p>
<p> You can try and combine them and get better results, but if you really need your device (including all apps) not to be aware of your current location, you’ll need to remove your SIM card, disable GPS, and then clear cache and data from various system services. </p>
<p> Then and only then you would be able to fully use a fake location on your handset. Follow these instructions to set a fake location on your Android: </p>
<p> Remove your SIM card from the device and make sure GPS is off. </p>
<p> Install NordVPN or any other VPN of your choice. </p>
<p> Now, navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps (Manage apps or Apps manager). </p>
<p> Once there, tap on the 3-dot menu and choose to Show system processes. </p>
<p> After that, navigate to all these apps and services and clear cache and data from each and every one: </p>
<p> FUSED LOCATION </p>
<p> GOOGLE </p>
<p> Don’t worry if you can’t find certain services, just stick with the ones you have. </p>
<p> Now, run the VPN app and choose any location you want. </p>
<p> This approach is recommended when you really need to download an app from a region that’s not supported (Spotify or Netflix) or get a system update over-the-air from a different region and not wait for days. </p>
<p> That’s a wrap. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to tell us what method you used to fake your location. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>
<p> Honestly, I think that NordVPN is fine on its own. Unless you are doing something that might have serious consequences, then maybe not. Not sure how much information people would try to dig up. But, NordVPN is a well-working application that works well with Netflix and other streaming services. Would recommend it </p>

<p> How to manage message notifications in Android P </p>
<p> Android Pie, the 9th iteration of the most used OS in the world, brought a hefty makeover, with all kinds of improvements, both feature-wise and performance-wise. And besides a visible and less visible overhaul, they made sure to improve on already great notification system and make life a tad easier for all Android users. </p>
<p> The majority of things stayed the same, with some smart enhancements in regards to notification shade content (now it can show images and more content and we expect the universal Smart Reply feature soon). Also, the machine-learning notification system now asks you to block notifications you frequently dismiss without opening them. </p>
<p> But, are the essentials different? Not so much. We’re still looking into a pure Android experience with some worthy improvements. Some users already voiced their love for the direction where the Oreo took us, and Pie is building on those fundaments quite successfully. </p>
<p> What about Messages, other Instant Messanger and their notifications though? </p>
<p> Along with the new OS, Android Messages get an overhaul of their own. Google is heavily pushing the Material Design and we even got the long-awaited Dark Mode. All nice and dandy in that department. The third-party apps are following closely with all kind of appreciated improvements. </p>
<p> Notifications-wise, the deal stays the same. You can change some general settings in the in-app settings, while the majority of tinkering is still reserved for the in-system settings. The minutiae options at your disposal come in abundance. </p>
<p> Android Pie brings more depth in system Notification settings, as the installed apps are now in a chronological order. The apps you recently used will be at the top, where you can meddle with their notifications, including messaging notifications. </p>
<p> You can disable and enable notifications with rather ease, just open Settings and navigate to Apps & notifications. Once there, expand the Advanced section and choose Notifications and then the individual app you want to tweak. </p>
<p> Be advised that Android Pie will ask to block notifications you’ve dismissed often, so if you do so, the message indication might not work. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Hopefully, you’ve learned something about Android Pie and the way it handles message notifications. Make sure to tell us how you like these changes in the comments section below. </p>

<p> How to recover your Gmail Account without a phone number </p>
<p> Many users who use Google Account and all associated services have privacy concerns over their data usage or personal information sharing. Some of them don’t want to assign their phone number as a tool for 2-factor-authentication via the SMS. Luckily, Google offers more than a few alternatives. If you like to use Gmail Account recovery without a phone number, learn how to do it below. </p>
<p> Use an alternative email address or code to secure your Gmail Account </p>
<p> 1. Use an alternative trusted device </p>
<p> The first thing you can do, in case you have multiple devices with the same Google Account, is using one device to verify the other. That way, you’ll avoid codes and there’s no need to use SMS verification. </p>
<p> Make sure you are already signed in on your other device and connected to Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Enter your Gmail Account and password and sign in on your current device. </p>
<p> When prompted about a new sign-in attempt, tap Yes to allow the sign-in. </p>
<p> 2. Use Backup codes </p>
<p> On the other hand, Backup codes are quite simple to use, as well. You get 10 codes and can generate as much as you like. Every code can be used only once. You can take a screenshot of the codes or write them down. Just make sure to keep them safe as this is not exactly the most secure 2-step verification option. </p>
<p> Now, you can save the codes list to your PC or write it down and, the next time you try to log in, just enter one of the available codes when prompted. </p>
<p> If you use all available codes, follow the same path, and generate new codes to use. </p>
<p> 3. Sign in with the Authenticator app </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can download and use the Authenticator app that’s, albeit outdated, still a useful alternative to SMS confirmation. </p>
<p> Sign in with your Google Account on Chrome for PC (or you can use a desktop mode on an alternative smartphone). </p>
<p> Go to Security > 2-step verification and click on Set up under the Authenticator app section. </p>
<p> Open the app on your device and choose Scan QR code. </p>
<p> Scan the code and you’ll have the temporary 6-digits-long code to use in order to log in. </p>
<p> There are a few more alternatives like the Security key that allows for a one-time sign-in. Google made sure to make user accounts as safe as possible and we highly recommend enabling 2-step verification. That way, you’ll ensure that no one can access your data or hijack your account. </p>
<p> With that said, we can call it a wrap. In case you have any questions, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. Thanks for reading and we look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<p> Fix: Snapchat stutters, lag and crashes on Android </p>
<p> Snapchat. One of those revolutionary apps that made an undeniable impact on the market. And, for a good reason. Firstly introduced as iOS exclusive, later take a major role within Android, too. And suddenly, it started declining to levels that make it almost unusable. Not for iOS, though. There is still a top-notch app if it’s to believe to reports. Until it cracks. </p>
<p> Even Android users are praising Snapchat, but that demographic is mostly covered with flagship users. The ones with the handsets that pack a little less punch are overwhelmed by all kinds of issues. One that’s hard to skip on is related to frequent crashes and lags. Most of those come due to a bad optimization, but some might be inflicted by other reasons. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to check our list that of workarounds. We prepared some possible solutions for your Snapchat ache. If you have had a hard time with crashes, make sure to track the steps below. </p>
<p> How to resolve Snapchat stutters and crashes on Android </p>
<p> Clear apps cache and data </p>
<p> Let’s start with the acknowledged route. Cache and data are there for a reason. Data is, obviously, everything you or app itself stores on the internal storage. In this case, photos, chat history and similar content. Cache, on the other hand, is there to speed app’s loading time. Both are important and both, sadly, can sometimes cause issues. With such a badly optimized app like Snapchat for Android, this might be a long shot. However, it won’t cost you anything to give it a try. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to clear both Data and Cache from the Snapchat app: </p>
<p> Tap Snapchat. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> After that, you might need to sign in again with your credentials. If nothing changed and Snapchat still crashes, move through the additional steps. </p>
<p> Clear cache within the Snapchat app interface </p>
<p> Now, besides the standard cache stored on internal storage of your device, there’s the in-app cache. In there, app backups some of the essential files, with the main purpose to decrease the loading time and grant you more seamless use of available features. Not all apps have this function, but most instant messengers or similar apps do. </p>
<p> In order to clear the cache from Snapchat, follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Open Snapchat. </p>
<p> Tap the Snapchat Ghost Mascot icon in the upper left corner. </p>
<p> Open Settings by tapping the Cog settings icon in the upper right corner. </p>
<p> Navigate to the Account Actions sections and tap on Clear Cache. </p>
<p> Exit the app and restart your device. </p>
<p> Try using the app again. If it lags or crashes, you can be certain that the problem is still there. </p>
<p> Update the Snapchat app </p>
<p> When it comes to Snapchat on Android, you must be aware that even the Snapchat developers said that they’re more iOS-oriented. That’s where the optimization comes into play. Certain high-end Android handsets won’t have any issues, while users with the low-end or just older devices will have a hard time using it. </p>
<p> For all avid users, the expectations last from patch to patch, but, until now, there’s only so much the devs have done to improve the app’s stability. They indeed add new features, but it seems like the overall usability is still a major downside. </p>
<p> However, since we can never know what they’ll address in the future, it’s always well-recommended to keep your app up to date. </p>
<p> Tap Play Store. </p>
<p> Open the 3-line menu. </p>
<p> Tap My Apps & Games. </p>
<p> Check for updates and install them. </p>
<p> If this somehow prevents Snapchat from crashing, then we apologize to uncalled critics against Snapchat. If that’s not the case, well, you better check out the remaining steps we enlisted. </p>
<p> Reinstall the Snapchat app </p>
<p> Even though the Android platform is much more homogenous nowadays, system update or structural changes within the system can affect the behavior of certain apps. And if an app is in a state in which is Snapchat currently, nothing should surprise you. The reinstallation is one way to address this. It functions similarly as it would on PC. An app is installed, certain permissions are granted, and suddenly it starts misbehaving. Renewing it might be useful. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Download older APK version </p>
<p> If the current, or even the latest few versions were causing issues, you can always downgrade by downloading the older, well-performing version. This procedure isn’t as simple as roaming through Play Store, but it might help you overcome the current issues you’re facing. Snapchat used to work better, and, if you can remember the version that suited your device best, you should grasp it. Luckily, some good folks from APK Mirror stored the majority of previous Snapchat versions. You might lack some lately introduced features, but, at least, you won’t experience crashes, lagging and debilitating performance drops. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to download and install the older APK version of Snapchat on your Android device: </p>
<p> Download the wanted version’s APK here on your PC. </p>
<p> Extract the file with WinRar or similar tool until you have the APK file. </p>
<p> Connect the Android device to the PC via USB and transfer the APK file to internal memory. </p>
<p> Uninstall the current version of the Snapchat app and restart your device. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Security, and enable Unknown sources. </p>
<p> Use a native file explorer or File Explorer to navigate to the folder where the APK file is stored. </p>
<p> Tap to install the APK with the older version. </p>
<p> After the process is finished, make sure not to install updates for the Snapchat app. </p>
<p> Settle with Instagram or Facebook Messenger </p>
<p> Finally, if you’re not keen to switch your daily driver for some high-end flagship or iPhone, your options are limited. The best thing about Android apps should be their optimization for older and a bit outdated devices. Snap Inc. is obviously not following that policy. As one Reddit users said in the dedicated subreddit, in regards to future improvements: </p>
<p> ‘‘We can only hope, but I have no expectations. I had problems with Snapchat years ago, but tried it again the last month or so. Eventually I had to uninstall again. </p>
<p> The app is worse than ever. I’m on a 5x and it was slow, significant delays to button presses, recording video would freeze for several seconds, etc. My phone also started to seemingly lock up (screen would not turn on, holding power would not boot, required a reset by holding buttons). At first I thought this was just a Nexus 5x issue but since uninstalling it hasn’t happened. The Instagram app is such a pleasure to use in comparison. </p>
<p> The app is garbage, it has been for years, and I’m not sure why they would fix it now if they haven’t already. The company is a mess, just look at the stock.” </p>
<p> If you agree, maybe it’s time to switch focus to apps that are, in comparison to Snapchat, getting better and better. It’s your decision, but, as the time pass, it seems that the Snapchat, a once favored instant messenger, is slowly declining. Even Facebook Messenger won’t crash as often, and Instagram is already far away in the concept of sheer social messaging, photos, videos, and even stories. </p>
<p> That’s just opinion. What’s yours? Are you satisfied with what Snapchat has to offer? Have you experienced crashes or other issues with the app? </p>

<p> HTC 10 common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Even though the market has a lot of great budget and mid-class devices to offer, the greatest race is always in the flagship category. HTC 10 is proper response of Taiwanese OEM. The phone took the market by the storm and briefly establish itself for one of the best devices you can obtain. It gained vastly positive reviews both for features and design. </p>
<p> However, even the most expensive, best designed and produced phones have an issue or two. And HTC 10 is not an excuse. For that purpose, we collected best-known issues with the idea to present them and advise you with possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Scrolling stutters issue </p>
<p> The first issue that we listed in this article is scrolling jitter, stutter or lag, as you wish. Various users reported this issue, both while scrolling trough the phone menu or while using third-party apps. </p>
<p> The most probable reason for this must be the Night mode in Nougat 7.0. For no apparent reason, Night mode, the feature that reduces eyestrain by changing display colors, causes stutters when scrolling. What you should try is disabling it. And you can do that in a few steps: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Display & Gestures (Display, gestures & buttons). </p>
<p> Choose Night mode and toggle it off. </p>
<p> Adjust manually color temperature. </p>
<p> This should resolve your problem with scroll stutters. If it doesn’t help, try restarting your phone. </p>
<p> Update to Nougat issues </p>
<p> Update issues are not a novelty. The reason we all waited for 7th Android OS upgrade is a better optimization and glitch fixes. However, it seems that some HTC 10 users, after the update finally come, have experienced various problems. </p>
<p> One of the mentioned issues is related to Airplane mode. Apparently, after an update is performed, the phone is stuck in Airplane mode. The restart fixed the problem temporarily but it is back after a while. We advise you to follow these steps in order to resolve this issue: </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your phone. </p>
<p> Press and hold Volume Down key. </p>
<p> While holding Volume Down, press Power button until the device vibrates. </p>
<p> In the next menu, highlight Wipe cache partition with Volume Down key. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to confirm. </p>
<p> After the process is finished, power on your HTC 10. </p>
<p> Have in mind that this procedure won’t delete your personal data. </p>
<p> Perform Factory reset </p>
<p> On the other hand, the factory reset (Hard reset) will erase all of your data so make sure you back it up accordingly. That includes your SD card data, as well. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Open Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to the cloud. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and your phone post-update issues should be resolved. </p>
<p> Wait for the next patch to address your issue </p>
<p> If you have nerves or an alternative device, you can also wait for the patch that will probably address this issue. </p>
<p> SD card Unrecognizable </p>
<p> As some users reported, their HTC 10 keeps unmounting the SD card or even renders it unrecognizable. That can create a lot of problems since you may be running some apps from the SD card rather than the phone. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, after you are certain that the SD card is functioning well with other devices, try these workarounds: </p>
<p> Remove and reinsert the card in HTC 10 </p>
<p> The first step is to check if the SD card is properly placed in its tray. Turn off your phone and remove SD card. Clean connectors and place it in the tray again. </p>
<p> Format SD card with phone or with PC </p>
<p> In case you’re still getting informed that the SD card is unmounted or it simply appears invisible, you should format it. It is advisable to perform the format procedure in HTC 10 for various reasons. However, if the card is unrecognizable, that won’t be possible. For either of two cases, you’ll probably want to back up your data: </p>
<p> Open SD card. </p>
<p> Tap the Menu in the upper-right. </p>
<p> Bluetooth pairing issue </p>
<p> Bluetooth excelled as one of the most important features on handheld devices with wireless headphones and car systems expansion. But, what is a good use of it if it disconnects all the time or can’t even pair with other devices? HTC 10 users reported a few issues regarding Bluetooth with just the same symptoms. </p>
<p> More often than not, it’s hard to resolve this issue by yourself. Either the update should fix it or the phone hardware needs to be checked. However, we’ll give you some heads-up on possible workarounds that may at least temporary resolve this issue. </p>
<p> Disable other network services while using Bluetooth (Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G). </p>
<p> ”Forget” device and try to pair again. </p>
<p> Wipe partition cache (process explained above). </p>
<p> Wi-Fi connection breaks </p>
<p> As some HTC 10 users reported, their wireless connectivity is subpar and drops down considerably once they move away from the router. To keep things in perspective, this can happen with all devices and is related to either a bug or a signal frequency. </p>
<p> You can fix it easily with few steps. </p>
<p> Reset your phone and wireless router. </p>
<p> ‘Forget’ your network and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Use 2.4Ghz signal instead of 5Ghz. With Nougat, the option to change Wi-Fi signal is removed so you’ll have to change your router configuration or use third-party programs and tweak settings. </p>
<p> Display issues </p>
<p> A multitude of HTC consumers reported various issues concerning HTC 10 display hue or touch malfunction. If hardware is not the culprit for this issues, they can be resolved. So, no need to worry. </p>
<p> As the manufacturer stated, the pink or orange hue can appear on some brand new phones. It’s due to special glue that connects display composition. After few days of use, when the glue dries, it should withdraw completely. </p>
<p> On the other hand, touch malfunction can be connected with various things. You can try these workarounds. </p>
<p> Enable Glove mode. </p>
<p> Boot in Safe Mode. </p>
<p> Update or reinstall troublesome apps that have a touch issue. </p>
<p> Restart to Factory settings. </p>
<p> Poor Mobile Data signal </p>
<p> In some cases, users experienced LTE speed drops or frequent disconnections with the HTC 10. Most of the time a few simple workarounds can solve the problem. However, since the mobile carrier has a large part in data usage, the issue can be on their part. </p>
<p> These are the steps you should take in order to resolve this issue: </p>
<p> Make sure your Mobile Data is enabled and not limited. </p>
<p> Battery life reduced </p>
<p> No matter what smartphone we are talking about, battery consumption is always a problem. And sadly HTC 10 has its battery issues, even though the battery is a quite strong feature of this phone. Namely, users are complaining about poor battery life that lasts just for a day or so. </p>
<p> There are just so many things you can do to improve your battery life. They are mainly universal and affect your overall phone experience. If you can’t use your phone’s full potential while trying to reduce battery consumption, there is a possibility you won’t be satisfied. So, let’s call these workarounds a temporary solution until producers create a battery with more longevity, the one that suits demanding hardware of modern flagship phones. </p>
<p> Reduce screen brightness. </p>
<p> On most occasions, you won’t need highest brightness settings. Lower them in order to preserve battery life. And since the display is battery nemesis, that should improve battery life considerably. You should find decrease brightness in the Notification panel or Settings > Display. </p>
<p> Disable apps and connections you don’t use from working in the background. </p>
<p> If you are not in need of constant connection on the go, turn off Mobile Data and Bluetooth. Additionally, you should disable apps that you don’t use at the time, but they still work in the background. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Tap app you want to Disable. </p>
<p> Tap Disable. </p>
<p> Don’t install unnecessary cleaning apps, and use built-in Boost+. </p>
<p> You can from time to time use Boost + to clean junk and marginally improve battery life. But, the thing of utmost importance is: do not install additional cleaners and battery optimizers. Firstly, they don’t even work as expected, and second more times than not they are the culprits for decreased battery life and performance issues. </p>
<p> Set Power Saving mode. </p>
<p> Power Saving mode or Extreme power saving mode are handy features that will help you extend battery life. Simply put, they automatically kill unneeded processes and lower the brightness. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Power. </p>
<p> Turn on Power saving mode or Extreme power saving mode. </p>
<p> Camera issues </p>
<p> And the last issue in this roundup is reserved for the camera. HTC 10 packs a nice camera combo. However, there are some problems that users shared and we’ll try and address them here. </p>
<p> For some users, camera use is followed with various glitches. For others, the default camera app won’t even start. We listed some troubleshoots bellow. </p>
<p> Check for physical obstructions on lenses. </p>
<p> First things first. Some protective cases may cover your lenses. Additionally, you can clean it with a wet tissue in case there is any dirt. </p>
<p> On some occasions, overheating can cause camera misbehave. Let it cool down. </p>
<p> Clear Camera App cache. </p>
<p> Even though it is backed up with superior firmware, default camera app is an app nonetheless. So, you should occasionally clear its cache. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Open Apps. </p>
<p> Choose Storage. </p>
<p> Tap Clear Data and Cache. </p>
<p> Update the apps that are using the camera (Snapchat, Instagram). </p>
<p> Another universal advice is to stick with proven camera apps for standard shots. Default camera most of the time. However, if some third-party apps are using the camera, make sure they are up to date. That way all the bugs and glitches will be patched sooner or later. </p>
<p> Boot in a Safe mode to check for third-party apps interference. </p>
<p> For purpose of troubleshooting, you can run Safe mode and observe camera behavior. If things improve, there is a possibility your system is overwhelmed with corrupting apps. On the other hand, if the issues are still present, there is a great chance of hardware malfunction. In that case, you should report this issue to phone vendor. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Every problem can be solved one way or another. While some other producers lack firmware support, HTC is taking care of its customers. So, the final advice would be to always check for updates. That way is easily dealt with most of the issues. Additionally, if you are sure that your hardware is not up to the task, report the problem immediately. You paid for great performance and that is what you should get. </p>
<p> If you have any additional issues or maybe alternative workaround, please tell is in the comments. </p>

<p> Fix: HTC One M9 screen flicker and shake </p>
<p> HTC One M9 is the proper response of Taiwanese giant to market needs. The phone has already proved as a viable option the in flagship class. And, to be fair, even the older M8 is still great hardware-wise in comparing to other devices presented in 2014. So, acquiring either phone is well-spent money. </p>
<p> While all the devices from this series, including the latest HTC One 10, are vastly improving overall users experience, all of them seem to have some moderate issues. Moreover, some of them are not software related, as the M9 overheating issue. On the other hand, some of them can be solved with few tweaks or simple workarounds. One of those is related to occasional screen flickering. We brought you an easy solution for this issue. </p>
<p> How to get rid of HTC One M9 screen flickering </p>
<p> This issue is caused by some advanced interface features that are not well optimized for the respective devices. Good thing is, though, that you can overpass standard limitations and disable them with ease. And this is how. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll to the bottom and tap About. </p>
<p> Once you’re there, find Build number. </p>
<p> Tap 7 times on the Build number until you are prompted with ”You are now a developer!” message. </p>
<p> After this Android shenanigan is done, Developer options will be enabled. </p>
<p> In the Developer options disable Strict Mode, Show Pointer Location, Show Touches, Show Screen Updates, Extreme Power Saving mode and Show CPU usage. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> This should resolve your issues with screen flickers and shakes. On the other hand, if the problem is persistent, there is a grave possibility for display or battery malfunction. If you have alternative solutions, please do tell us in the comments. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/huawei-honor-8-bugs" parent_folder="web1" id="file17843058" filename="huawei-honor-8-bugs">
<p> Huawei Honor 8 most common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei has gained a lot of popularity lately with both Mate (flagship) and Honor (mid-range) series. Honor 8 is the latest addition to the list of mid-budget devices produced by the Chinese company. Upon presentation for the US and EU market, the phone received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, even though Honor 8 offers good performance for an affordable price, there are some common issues worth mentioning. Users reported various problems with both hardware and software. It seems that the producer addressed some of the problems, but there is a large number of those that they need to resolve. Today we listed for you the known issues and possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Video crash while playing </p>
<p> As some of the users stated, the Honor 8 have a lot of issues with the video playback or streaming. It seems that the video crashes and, on some occasion, a restart is the only solution to get things work again. According to them, the crash occurs in online or offline videos, regardless. On the other hand, the fundament of the problem is YouTube. </p>
<p> We have noticed that the problem is widespread and the main culprit is integration with third-party apps. For the standard videos, first and foremost is to check the format. Honor 8 supports these video formats: </p>
<p> WMV </p>
<p> RM </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the online streaming videos are the ones with issues, make sure that you reinstall the given app or try an alternative. It seems that the Honor 8 have a certain level off incompatibility with some of them. Additionally, if the problem is persistent, you should contact customers support and ask for a replace. </p>
<p> Video recording stutter in third-party apps </p>
<p> While this is not as crushing (no pun intended) as the previous issue, it can be as annoying. Namely, many users reported lag and stutter while recording videos on Snapchat or Instagram story. This often leads to unsynchronized audio and video. </p>
<p> This seems to be related to awkward camera overheating. You should check the top of your phone for temperature changes. If the phone’s temperature is normal, try restarting your phone and clearing the app cache and data. Moreover, you can check your battery temperature by typing this code in your dialer *#*#2846579#*#*. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the phone is overheated (and that seems to happen often with some users), you’ll have to let it cool down. The camera behavior is not a strong feature of this model since the following default software is underwhelming. We’ll have to wait and see are there any fixes prepared in the next update build. </p>
<p> 3G works instead LTE, WiFI won’t connect </p>
<p> Connectivity is a common issue with the Honor 8. A large number of users reported problems related both to Wi-Fi and data networks. The phone won’t connect to a known network for ages or it chooses 3G instead of much faster LTE. </p>
<p> You can try following workarounds for data network issue: </p>
<p> Switch Network type: Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings: Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Forget network and reestablish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> The Huawei confirmed that they are aware of the Wi-Fi issue. We can hope that they’ll fix it with the next patch. </p>
<p> Echo while calling </p>
<p> Some users reported a problem with in-call speaker and mic malfunction. According to them, they hear the echo while speaking on the phone. The issue is more present when the loudspeaker is ON. </p>
<p> This is a common issue with many Android-powered phones. Most of the time it is related to pre-installed Google app called TalkBack. Our advice is to turn it off. </p>
<p> No battery percentage was shown </p>
<p> Honor 8 isn’t presenting battery percentage on the home screen by default. Most of the users are accustomed to that feature and they want to enable it but don’t know how. And this is the simplest way: </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon. </p>
<p> In the upper right corner, you’ll see 3 icons. </p>
<p> Tap Battery icon that is in the middle. </p>
<p> Notifications are not displayed when screen is off </p>
<p> Some of the users were left in disbelief when their push notifications from various apps stopped. It can be a quite annoying experience that ruins all-around impression about the phone. Which is pretty great in all manners. </p>
<p> Huawei made a strange decision to improve battery life by completely disabling the notifications while the screen is off. Luckily, that can be changed in a few simple steps. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Protected apps. </p>
<p> Add apps that you want to receive notifications from. </p>
<p> We hope you’ll find this article helpful. Additionally, we are sure that the phone will function much better once it gets updated to Nougat 7.0. The update cycle started on 10th February so be sure to check your phones. </p>

<p> Huawei Honor 9 Lite common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei’s subsidiary, Honor, does make some good phones. Their Honor series (closely followed with the Honor Lite series) is a nifty bunch of amazing handsets and the sales are showing people like what they have to offer for more than the affordable price tag. Today we’ll be talking about one of the most interesting devices from the last year, the Honor Lite 9. We decided to tackle head-on most prominent issues this handset has and provide you with solutions. </p>
<p> If you’re a proud owner of this, both visually and performance-wise, spectacular device and having some minor problems, check the list below. </p>
<p> 1: Battery drainage </p>
<p> This isn’t uncommon for a feature-packed device which the Honor Lite 9 certainly is. Sometimes the problem is, of course, that you get used to a certain performance, a certain battery longevity and Screen-on Time, so even the smallest discrepancy gets on your nerves. Not in this case, sadly. Users reported a noticeable drop in the battery life after some time. </p>
<p> Now whether this is provoked by a firmware update, or you’ve made certain changes to a way you’re using your device – we can’t say with certainty. What we can do, on the other hand, is offer you a few ways to improve your battery life substantially. Check them out below: </p>
<p> Change the screen resolution to HD+ instead of smart or FHD+. </p>
<p> Limit the unnecessary apps from starting and working in the background with the Phone Manager. </p>
<p> Use Greenify or a similar app to additionally limit the background activity of some apps. Have in mind that this will affect the push notifications and most of them won’t come through. </p>
<p> Disable Mobile Data always on in Developer Options. </p>
<p> 2: Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Wi-Fi performance on Huawei-made devices was always above the average. And that’s basically the same on the Honor 9 Lite. With one little bug being an exception, and that’s the Bluetooth throttling the Wi-Fi. We run into this error and we ensure you that a simple system update addresses this completely. Until then, you can opt-out of Bluetooth while roaming online. </p>
<p> In regards to Mobile Data issues, some users reported problems with VoLTE, where there are unable to connect. We strongly encourage you to restart your handset and check the SIM card positioning. Also, resetting the APN settings might help. Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> In addition, if you’re still stuck with particular Wi-Fi or Mobile Data related issues, the explanation on resetting Network settings is at the bottom. </p>
<p> Although be advised, this will clear all saved SSID passwords, remove Bluetooth pairings, and reset APN settings. </p>
<p> 3: Phone lagging and freezing </p>
<p> With the introduction of GPU Turbo mode which substantially improves the in-game performance, users were hoping for even smoother and fluent experience. However, some of them reported various lags and freezes. </p>
<p> Now, this only applies to users with the fully stock ROM. If you’ve meddled with custom ROMs, we can’t help you and the only thing we can suggest is reflashing the latest stock ROM. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if lags and freezes were triggered by an update or started suddenly on the official ROM, make sure to check the steps below in order to fix or at least reduce them: </p>
<p> Reboot your phone in the Safe mode and look for changes. </p>
<p> Disable some intensive applications from the Phone Manager. Some apps you don’t need working in the background might slow down the performance. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 4: Camera issues </p>
<p> Users are quite loudly asking for a multitude of features the stock camera app is missing. And they have right, as the back dual-sensor combo deserves a better software support. There’s only so much you can do but wait in regards to camera bugs. Honor promised some improvements and, since they used to deliver until this day, we can expect them soon enough. </p>
<p> For the time being, if you’re not satisfied with how the camera performs or by the lack of AI support, try a third-party camera from the Play Store. Also, here’s the list of some general troubleshooting steps when it comes to camera issues: </p>
<p> Reset Camera settings to default values. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Test the camera in the Safe Mode. </p>
<p> 5: The display is pixelated or reddish </p>
<p> Users also have had a hard time with the pixelated display in some third-party apps. This makes the content gloomy and barely readable. Others, on the other hand, reported that the red hue is too dominant, so the display has a reddish tint. We encourage you to update your device as soon as possible if any updates are available at the moment. </p>
<p> Also, if you want to be handy on your own, follow these steps to resolve the pixelization issue: </p>
<p> Change the width in the Developer options from 360 to 401. </p>
<p> Use an alternative browser (Stable Chrome has known issues with this). </p>
<p> And these should help you resolve the reddish tint: </p>
<p> Disable Eye comfort. </p>
<p> Change the screen resolution to HD+ instead of smart or FHD+. </p>
<p> Change Colour temperature to cool or default. </p>
<p> 6: Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> We already mentioned Bluetooth negatively affects the Wi-Fi for some reason on some Honor 9 Lite devices. Besides that bug, we have gathered more than a few reports about a failed Bluetooth pairings or crashing connection. Especially while using wireless headphones or car system. </p>
<p> This is quite an underwhelming issue for users who like to link their handset with a plethora of devices, but a firmware update should fix it. Meanwhile, while we’re waiting for Honor to do something about that, give this steps a shot: </p>
<p> Unpair devices and try pairing them again. </p>
<p> Check the second device. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi and Mobile Data temporarily. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> 7: Underwhelming audio output </p>
<p> Out of all complaints (and there’s not many of those to start with), the audio output and overall sound on the Honor Lite 9 get the most negative impressions from the community. This applies both to the sound while playing multimedia files or while talking on the phone. </p>
<p> It’s hard to expect miracles from a budget (or low-midrange device) like this, but we also can name a few from the top of our head which does have much better sound quality. Now, we might expect some updates in the future but the thing with this mono speaker is that it’s just, well, not that good at all. And you can’t do much about it. </p>
<p> 8: Fingerprint issues </p>
<p> There are some things OEMs need to cut in order to make the mid-range or budget device priced at that range. Those cuts don’t apply to the fingerprint scanner, luckily. The back-placed fingerprint scanner on the Honor 9 Lite is as snappy and responsive as it’s a much more expensive device in question. However, some minor issues might emerge from time to time, and they’re most of the time related to software. </p>
<p> A simple restart can take you far in resolving minor hiccups like a temporary unresponsive fingerprint reader. With that in mind, if you’re indeed stuck, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Re-configure the fingerprint and set a new Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Try booting into Safe mode and, if the fingerprint and IR scanner perform better, uninstall all recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Remove the tempered glass or cases which may cover the fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Clean the fingerprint sensor from a debris and greasy dirt with a wet cloth. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory values. </p>
<p> 9: Overheating </p>
<p> Finally, the last but not least place is reserved for rare overheating occurrences. Now, don’t mistake a slightly hot on touch phone with the overheating. If you’ve played a graphically demanding game for some time or charged your device, it will get hot. </p>
<p> However, if it gets hot even when it’s in the idle state, then we’re looking at the possible overheating and that’s not something you want to neglect. With the gaming mode and the GPU Turbo at play, this handset can do great but, in comparison to Honor Play, it doesn’t have a specialized cooling system. </p>
<p> That’s why you should leave it be while charging (fast chargers will heat up the device fast) and also remove the case. On the other hand, if the phone is hot at all times, consider resetting it to factory values and, eventually, taking it to the responsible official service for mandatory tests. </p>
<p> 10: Common Advanced steps for Honor 9 Lite </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap System. </p>
<p> Select About phone. </p>
<p> Get back to System and there you should see Developer options. </p>
<p> Reset the Honor Play to factory settings </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> After these, we can conclude this article. Have in mind that these are isolated issues (with the sound being an only exception), and that there’s a high chance you’ll never see any of them. So, don’t let this discourage you from acquiring this great device. </p>
<p> Also, tell us about your issues with the Honor Lite 9 in the comments section below. We’ll be glad to help if capable. </p>

<p> Brand new phone with new sim. Partner set it up but overnight it went funny and demanded a factory reset and now won’t recognise any google account that we thought we set up. How do we get past that? </p>

<p> Huawei Mate 20 Lite common problems, and how to fix (some of) them </p>
<p> Huawei Mate 20 Lite has instantly positioned itself as a leading budget phone on the market. It delivers the premium feel for an affordable price, and a list of specs that can compete with any other device in the category. Sure, it’s not the premier budget phone, as there are phones with better cameras, CPUs, screens, etc. But if you’re looking for the most complete package and a phone that does everything exceptionally well, the Huawei Mate 20 Lite is the way to go. </p>
<p> Given its approval by the consumers and reviewers, a lot of people already own this device. And judging by the reviews and feedback, the Huawei Mate 20 Lite is working quite well for most people. </p>
<p> However, an issue here and there may occur occasionally. That’s why we wandered the forums in search of the freshly reported issues with the Huawei Mate 20 Lite. So, if you’ve recently encountered any of these issues on your new phone, I hope you’ll find a solution in this article. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1.Screen dimming </p>
<p> Screen dimming is not a bug per se, it’s “caused” by a poorly designed system feature. And it’s not exclusive to the Mate 20 Lite, as actually, all Huawei phones have the same “issue”. That “dimming”, as users usually describe it, is actually the Adaptive brightness, which changes the phone’s brightness depending on the ambient light, or apps’ background. </p>
<p> Now, I’d normally advise you to go and disable the Adaptive brightness feature to resolve this problem, but that’s not entirely possible here. Namely, the Huawei Mate 20 Lite (and other Huawei phones) controls the brightness on its own. And even though the option for disabling the Adaptive brightness is available, it will be re-enabled on the next reboot. Nobody knows why it’s like that, but it’s simply the way EMUI is designed. </p>
<p> Right now, there’s nothing you can do about it. A lot of people are complaining about this, so Huawei may decide to change this setting in the future, but we don’t know anything about it right now. </p>
<p> 2. Battery drainage </p>
<p> Right now, there’s no known trigger for the battery drainage problem. So, even if you do experience bad battery life, the issue will probably get resolved with the next software update. So, just make sure to check for updates regularly. </p>
<p> On top of that, there could be some other reasons for the battery drainage, like an app that eats too much battery or unnecessary background services (although, due to a good optimization of the system, this isn’t as big of a factor as it was before). </p>
<p> Just make sure you have everything in check. </p>
<p> 3. Headphones volume too low </p>
<p> This is another issue that’s common to multiple Huawei phones. Namely, numerous users have reported that MIUI is simply designed to decrease the volume automatically. So, if you’re not satisfied with the volume level on your Huawei Mate 20 Lite, keep in mind that’s just how your phone works. </p>
<p> What’s even more interesting is that this ‘volume stabilization feature’ doesn’t work the same way on different Huawei phones. That’s why some users are complaining about it, while others don’t even notice anything. </p>
<p> To partially resolve this ‘problem’, you can use a sound boosting or equalizer app to gain more control over audio on your phone. </p>
<p> 4. Bad Bluetooth audio quality </p>
<p> Bad Bluetooth audio quality can also be associated with the above-mentioned sound controlling feature. However, one of the main reasons for bad Bluetooth audio quality generally is using the wrong Bluetooth codec. </p>
<p> So, if you’re not satisfied with the audio quality on your Bluetooth headphones or speakers, go to settings and change the default Bluetooth codec. To do this, you’ll need to have the Developer Options enabled. In case you don’t have this feature enabled, here’s how to turn it on: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll down and tap About phone. </p>
<p> Find the Build number section. </p>
<p> Start tapping the Build number section continuously until you get a pop-up message saying that you’re a Developer now. </p>
<p> After this, the Developer Options section will appear in the Settings. </p>
<p> Now, that you’re officially “a developer”, it’s time to change your Bluetooth codec. Most phones use the SBC codec by default, which is now outdated, and you should switch to the aptX codec for better audio quality. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System > Developer Options. </p>
<p> Scroll down, and open Bluetooth Audio Codec. </p>
<p> Select aptX HD from the list of codecs. </p>
<p> You’re now using the aptX HD codec, and the audio quality should be better, at least that’s how it is in theory. Please also keep in mind that, depending on your Bluetooth headphones, the audio quality is generally lower than in the wired headphones, so there might be nothing you can do after all. </p>
<p> 5. SD card appears as damaged </p>
<p> Now, we’ve come to this phone’s biggest and probably most controversial issue so far. Namely, numerous users have been reporting that they cannot use their SD cards normally, as the phone recognizes them as damaged. </p>
<p> This topic has raised a big debate on Huawei’s official forum, as more and more people are reporting the exact same issue. </p>
<p> Huawei’s official support claims it’s a software issue, and that the developers are working on the fix. However, the problem still seems to exist, as no one actually received the fixing update yet. </p>
<p> Some people even report they had their phones taken to the official service, but the service failed to do anything, and they got their phones back without any improvements. </p>
<p> On the other hand, not all phones are affected by this problem, so it’s really the Russian roulette here. You may get a faulty phone, but you also may not. Right now, there’s nothing you can really do to resolve this problem, except using your warranty to replace the phone. </p>
<p> The debate is ongoing on Huawei’s official forum, so you can keep track for any updates on the situation. If/when the problem gets resolved, we’ll update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> 6. Notifications not showing </p>
<p> The push notifications problem is another issue common to notched Huawei phones, especially to the Mate 20 series. Namely, as the notch occupies a huge portion of the screen, there’s no much space left for anything other than permanent icons (battery, time, network signal, etc.), so the notifications from other apps don’t usually appear. Oddly enough, even turning off the notch won’t resolve the problem. </p>
<p> That’s just how the EMUI user interface is designed, and a fixing update is nowhere in sight. So, you’ll probably have to bear with this as long as you’re using the Huawei Mate 20 Lite. </p>
<p> 7. Common Advanced solutions for the Huawei Mate 20 Lite </p>
<p> And now something none of you like to see, but I had to include the general solutions in this article, simply because one of these may actually resolve a potential issue. That means you can use these workarounds to resolve basically any problem inside the Huawei Mate 20 Lite. It may not help, but you never know. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Reset the Huawei Mate 20 Lite to factory settings </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I certainly hope you found a solution to your problem, or at least understand the issue better. If you’ve encountered some flaw I didn’t mention here, don’t hesitate to share it with all of us in the comments below. </p>

<p> My MATE 20 LITE before updating to EMUI 10, utrasound detection above 10000 Hz worked perfectly for it. Now it does not detect frequencies above 10000 Hz. I tried almost all the applications and the same, it does not work. For my tests I have had to dust off old cell phones that do it well. Example of one of the Spectroid applications used. For the fine attention you have in this regard, thank you. </p>

<p> Hi has any one else had this problem. When I try and set the phone up I select English and then accept the terms and conditions it then asks me to insert my SIM and then once I have entered my pin the phone restarts and asks for the pin again and then I get a message to say the phone has been rooted. Continuing to use HUAWEI ID may pose security risks. I took my first phone back because of this and changed it for another one and the same thing has happened and when I looked rooted up… Read more » </p>

<p> How to prevent Huawei Mate 9 from accidentally unlocking in your pocket </p>
<p> Huawei Mate 9 was released a few weeks ago. While the first reviews are generally positive, there are some issues that bother users. One user at XDA forums reported an unusual problem with his new phone. </p>
<p> Apparently, his Huawei Mate 9 constantly tries to unlock while in his pocket. This leads to another problem, where he needs to wait 15 seconds to unlock the phone. Here’s what he said on the forums: </p>
<p> “I have found 3 mornings in a row that when the phone is in my pocket and I walk to work its clearly trying to turn itself on, as when I pull it out the phone is in suspend mode and says I can’t unlock it for 15 mins. It must be responding to sensors or the power button isn’t strong enough to avoid accidental presses. It says “fingerprint suspended try again in x minutes”. The pin entry is non responsive during this time so its clearly a security lock which is being triggered by false movements.” </p>
<p> This has been a common problem with Android phones for ages. Luckily, Android Nougat, and Huawei Mate 9 at the same time have a solution for this problem. </p>
<p> How to prevent your phone from unlocking in your pocket </p>
<p> To prevent Huawei M9, and basically any Android Nougat-compatible phone from unlocking in your pocket, you simply need to enable one setting. Here’s exactly what you need to do: </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Now, go to Security > Smart Lock, and confirm your security pattern </p>
<p> When the Smart Lock screen pops up, tap on Got it to continue </p>
<p> Go to On-body detection </p>
<p> Toggle On-body detection on </p>
<p> This will enable special sensors on your phone, that will recognize when your phone is in your pocket. Additionally, this feature will keep your phone unlocked while it’s in your hand, and locked while it’s in your pocket. You can use this method on basically any Android phone with Nougat installed, not just Huawei Mate 9. </p>
<p> That’s it, you now know how to keep your phone locked while in your pocket. In case you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, just let us know in the comments. </p>

<p> Huawei P10 Lite common issues, and how to resolve them </p>
<p> Huawei’s enormous growth is well-justified by the devices they delivered in the last few years. It’s only the question of time before they get to contest first place with Apple or Samsung. And latest flagship ”P” handsets are definitely a step forward in many regards. </p>
<p> Even though P10 Lite isn’t on the same level as P10 and P10 plus flagships, it’s an amazing mid-range handset that rewards users with a slick design, great IPS LCD screen and overall above-average performance. It comes with the latest version of Huawei Android variation, EMUI 5.1, and to date, P10 Lite received mostly positive reviews. </p>
<p> However, after some time, issues started to pile up. Don’t get us wrong, this is is the case with most other devices and the problems we enlisted below aren’t common and widespread. But, if you have any issues with your latest acquisition, make sure to check the list below and look up for a solution. </p>
<p> Battery drainage </p>
<p> Huawei is not known for fast battery drainage on previous devices, but, it seems that the latest addition to P lite series is somewhat troubled in that regard. With the 3000 mAh, P10 Lite battery doesn’t lack longevity, at least if you’re not an intensive user. Fast charging is a great improvement over P9 and will let you recharge much faster. However, it seems that the EMUI 5.1 kind of drains more battery than EMUI 5.0 and the more demanding screen is a greater consumer, too. </p>
<p> Some users reported that the battery life is underwhelming, so we prepared some tips for you to improve it. If you’re unsure what to do, the steps below should be informative. </p>
<p> Disable power-consuming background apps. You can do that within the Phone Manager > Lock Screen Cleanup. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location Mode, and choose Device only if you’re not in need of GPS’s high accuracy at the moment. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location > 3-dot Menu > Scan settings, and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, respectively. </p>
<p> Reset phone in Safe mode and look for changes. If the battery life is much longer, that would imply that some 3rd-party app is hogging on your battery. Most of the time, the problem is resolved by uninstalling lately installed apps. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Disable Auto brightness and set a preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Slow speed and lag </p>
<p> In the hardware department, P10 Lite is probably one of the best-buy models in the mid-range category. It’s fast and reliable as they come. However, the occasional issues with performance aren’t unusual. Some of them reported freezes after unlocking while others have had experienced performance drops while running some demanding games. </p>
<p> Even the manufacturer said that the eMMC memory instead of faster UFS. That’s just like that. Another thing that might affect performance drops is related to overheating which we will address below. </p>
<p> If you’ve experienced something similar, there are some things you can do to resolve the issue. </p>
<p> Restart your device. If it won’t react to standard Power Off procedure, you can force shut down by holding the Power button long enough. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. Follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Let the phone cool down for a while. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> SIM card issues </p>
<p> Just as the previous iterations in P Lite series, P10 Lite supports either dual-SIM or SIM + SD card variation. Now, it’s not exactly hard to set up preferred cards in the compartment, but there are some things to know. Firstly, only the primary SIM card supports 3G and above technologies. Second is exclusively bound to 2G. So, if you’ve experienced connection losses or a network coverage error, make sure to check which card you use. </p>
<p> In addition, you should double check is everything set as intended before the suspicion of hardware malfunction arises. In addition, you can restart your device and look for changes. After that, you shouldn’t have any problems with the SIM card. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issue </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues were not uncommon for Huawei handsets before, and they are still present for some users of P10 Lite. Some of them reported connectivity issues while trying to pair their phone with the car media board or a wireless headset. For some, the connection is unstable and crashing frequently, while others weren’t able to connect in the first place. Firstly, you must make sure that the P10 Lite is the culprit for the failed pairing. Check connection with multiple devices to make sure that the phone is the problem. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, follow the instructions below to resolve the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Make sure that the Airplane mode is disabled. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Clear pairing and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Try disabling Wi-Fi and Mobile Data while using Bluetooth. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, you should contact your vendor or responsible carrier since the problem is certainly hardware-related. </p>
<p> Fingerprint scanner issues </p>
<p> The fingerprint scanner is more than a useful feature on flagship devices. But, lately, even the mid-range devices are packing reader with a variety of nifty uses. And Huawei is one of the first large manufacturers that started implementing fingerprint reader on the majority of its devices. The scanner on Huawei P10 Lite is just as fast and well-placed like on P9. But, there’s still a problem or two regarding its occasional erratic behavior. </p>
<p> There are some workarounds you can apply before concurring that the hardware is the problem. </p>
<p> Clean your fingerprint scanner. Use a wet cloth to clean the fingerprint scanner of dirt. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable fingerprint gestures. Open Settings > Fingerprint ID, and disable all gestures except the standard unlock feature. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> In the end, if the problem is persistent, contact your vendor or carrier and report the problem. </p>
<p> Volume issues </p>
<p> Certain users reported issues with the sound volume of certain apps notifications and many other aspects, with the exclusion of ringer sound that works as intended. Namely, some of them reported too loud or quiet notifications and other multimedia features. And even though they tried to regulate or even mute the sound, it still remained the same. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to wait for the future update which should resolve the sound bug. Meanwhile, you can use the ”Do not disturb” mode to disable certain sounds. In addition, try some of these workarounds: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Boot in safe mode. </p>
<p> Turn off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button. </p>
<p> Once the Huawei screen appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> You should see the ‘Safe mode’ notification in the lower-left corner of the screen. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC with HiSuite. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to back up your data. </p>
<p> Overheating issues </p>
<p> Another problem that emerged with the introduction of massive hardware improvements is the overheating. And most of the modern smartphones will eventually get hot, but some of them are more prone to it than others. Huawei P10 Lite, for example, is prone to overheating. Especially in the upper back part. Don’t get us wrong, this occurrence requires certain circumstances, like intensive gaming or exposure to the sun for an extended period, or use during charging. </p>
<p> Because of that, make sure to keep your phone far from the heat sources and leave it be while fast charging. In addition, don’t use alternative, commercial chargers instead of the one OEM provided you with. </p>
<p> Moreover, if the device overheating occurs during the idle state or standard use, make sure to take it for repair or ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Besides the Bluetooth issue, there are additional problems that are also related to connectivity. Namely, some users reported poor Wi-Fi signal or constant disconnection while using P10 Lite. In addition, others are experiencing poor connection while using Mobile data. There are so many factors for this occurrence, and many of those are not exclusively phone-related. </p>
<p> We enlisted some of the probable solutions for the problem and you can find them just below. </p>
<p> Mobile Data troubleshooting: </p>
<p> Switch Network type. Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. Go to Settings > More > Cellular networks > Access Point Names > Tap Menu > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> For Wi-Fi issue try these solutions: </p>
<p> Reset your router. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Forget network and re-establish a Wi-FI connection. </p>
<p> Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz. It lacks range, but it’s a more stable option. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition within Recovery settings. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> After that, your connectivity issues should be long gone. In contrary, if those steps failed to resolve the issue at hand, make sure to report the problem to service or to manufacturer support itself. </p>
<p> That should be it. If you have any additional problems or alternative solutions for the ones presented, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Huawei P30 Lite common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Huawei P30 Lite is the successor of highly-popular P Lite series and it definitely rises up to the occasion. Tripple camera setup along with the great front-facing camera, potent chipset, and solid battery make for an all-around good mid-ranger. However, as we all know, there’s no perfect device (especially software-wise) and the Huawei P30 Lite has its own share of common issues. </p>
<p> We made sure to list the most common ones and present them to you along with applicable solutions. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Battery drains </p>
<p> The first reported problem we run into is a massive hit to battery longevity some users experienced. The Huawei P30 Lite is definitely not a battery champion in the mid-range class, with a 3340 mAh battery. However, the SoT, thanks to a heavy EMUI optimization and 6.15-inch screen, shouldn’t be bad in the slightest. </p>
<p> If the battery drains started after a system update, you can try and back up your data and reset the device to factory values. On the other hand, there are some things you can do to extend battery life. Check them out below: </p>
<p> Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Disable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location Mode, and choose Device only if you’re not in need of GPS’s high accuracy at the moment. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Location > 3-dot Menu > Scan settings, and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, respectively. </p>
<p> Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > and individually disable Autostart on apps. </p>
<p> Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery. </p>
<p> 2. SIM card issues </p>
<p> Since the dual-SIM is an option, many users will utilize it and use two separate nano-SIM cards on their P30 Lite. However, there seems to be an issue with the secondary SIM card for some of them, along with some 3G/4G mobile data issues. </p>
<p> If you are unable to make the second SIM card work, try removing it and placing it in again. After that reboot your device. Finally, make sure that the SIM card is activated within Settings. </p>
<p> In regards to mobile data issues, make sure setting the preferred mobile network connection in Settings. If that fails, remove SIM cards, reset Network settings, and insert SIM cards again. </p>
<p> 3. Max volume is too low </p>
<p> In such a cluttered and competitive market, many times things come to nitpicking. However, there are some legitimate downsides to the Huawei P30 Lite that users can’t find a way around. </p>
<p> One common and out-of-the-box issue with the Huawei P30 Lite is quite a low volume coming from the single bottom-firing speaker. Even if the volume is maxed out. </p>
<p> Sadly, the only thing you can do is wait for an update to address this. Due to the limited approach to OS modding (Huawei prevents bootloader unlocking), you won’t be able to do much. </p>
<p> Try enabling the Disable absolute volume option in Developer options for Bluetooth headsets, but don’t hold your hopes high in regards to the built-in speaker. </p>
<p> 4. UI lags, stutters, and ghost touch issues </p>
<p> Even though the included hardware (Huawei’s-own Kirin 710 chipset and up to 8 GB of RAM) should be enough for the P30 Lite to work without any issues, there are some reports about UI lags and stutters. </p>
<p> In order to fix this, you can try navigating to Developer options and reducing the Animation scaling and disabling some third-party apps working in the background while gaming. Here’s how to access Developer options on the Huawei P30 Lite: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open the About phone. </p>
<p> Tap 7 times on the Build number. </p>
<p> Open Developer options. </p>
<p> Navigate to Animations and reduce them from 1 to 0.5. </p>
<p> Alternatively, enable the “Force activities to be resizable” option. </p>
<p> Besides that, some users reported a ghost touch, blaming protection film. However, it seems that issues continued even when the protective film was removed. If that happens, we can only suggest resetting your device to factory values. </p>
<p> 5. No updates available </p>
<p> Huawei is not known for its timely Android updates. They are even an OEM that has the biggest OS fragmentation on their devices as users wait for months for the new release of EMUI. </p>
<p> Now, since the P30 Lite is a part of their P series from this year, updates to EMUI 10 are to be expected in April 2020 at the latest. </p>
<p> However, some users read that there’s a firmware update available. Now, if you haven’t enrolled in the Beta program for Android 10, you won’t be able to get it until the global release sees the light. </p>
<p> However, you should still receive monthly security updates and patches on EMUI 9.1. If that’s not the case, make sure to check for updates manually. If the problem persists, reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6. Camera issues </p>
<p> A major differentiating point going for flagship devices in previous years was high-end lenses with amazing photo quality. However, mid-range devices are getting there and, with all hardware included, the P30 Lite should be more than a competitive photo-taking smartphone. </p>
<p> And that’s true for the most part. Tripple camera setup is great with an above-average front-facing selfie camera. However, some users are having a hard time with the camera integration in third-party apps (e.g. Facebook Messenger, Instagram). </p>
<p> Seemingly, the quality declines a lot and the whole photo-video-taking experience is substantially slower. Especially when compared to similar or even cheaper devices. </p>
<p> Ways to tackle this are fairly limited, so we suggest clearing cache and data from the Camera app and affected apps, checking permissions and keeping your phone up to date. Hopefully, the problem will be sorted out with future updates. </p>
<p> 7. Apps won’t install </p>
<p> The Google-Huawei split lead to multiple obvious software-related issues on devices introduced in 2019. Due to limitations imposed by Google, all Google services are prohibited on certain versions of the P30 Lite. </p>
<p> Now, the Europan version (MAR-LX1A) should integrate Google services without any issues as most of the others. However, there’s a slight chance you got a device that goes by as the Huawei Nova 4X, chances are you won’t be able to get Google services. </p>
<p> If you are certain that your version works with Google services, make sure to first update your device. If the problem persists, reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 8. Overheating issues </p>
<p> Overheating is, as the majority of problems here, a not quite widespread issue on the Huawei P30 Lite. However, the problem seems to occur for some users, especially while talking on the phone. Namely, the handset gets really hot after some time. In other instances, like extensive gaming sessions, overheating is not uncommon. </p>
<p> There are multiple ways to reduce overheating on your handset, so check out these steps below: </p>
<p> Remove the protective casing while talking on the phone. </p>
<p> Make sure you have good network coverage as the bed network coverage will lead to overheating on some devices. </p>
<p> Don’t use your device while charging. </p>
<p> If the problem started after an update, reset your device to factory settings and restore it from a backup. </p>
<p> 9. Gallery images are corrupt </p>
<p> This one is simple. There’s no chance that photos or videos on your device will “get corrupt”. The SD card, on the other hand, is quite capable of getting corrupt. </p>
<p> The only reason why images or any other multimedia file is missing might be due to either SD card not being loaded (might be a physical problem in placement or permission issue) or being corrupt. </p>
<p> If the latter happened, there’s not much you can do. You can try connecting your SD card to a PC and extracting data that way. Other than that, you can only format it and start from scratch. </p>
<p> 10. Useful troubleshooting steps for the Huawei P30 Lite </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition (to resolve app certain app issues): </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select the Recovery mode with the single press of the Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start the Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation points should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article about the Huawei P30 Lite common issues and their respective solutions. You can send tickets to Huawei and inform them about bugs, here. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share issues we overlooked in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: iMessage doesn’t show “delivered” on sent texts </p>
<p> iMessage has been an essential part of iOS since the beginning. This native messaging app for iPhones is probably one of the features that showcase a general simplicity and usability of iOS. However, over time, it has undergone so many changes, that’s hard to find your way around, especially after updates. </p>
<p> After updating to iOS 10.3.2, users had a problem with the ”Delivery report” feature which, logically, informs you that the message you’ve sent is received. Namely, they’re unable to get the ‘Delivered’ indicator no matter what they do. Basically, there is a few reasons community has suspected, but we can’t confirm them with certainty. </p>
<p> As you know, this functions only with the iMessage. If you send just a text message, you won’t be able to see is the message delivered or not. On the other hand, if you’ve sent the iMessage with the blue mark, you should be able to get a ”Delivered” indicator. Now, there are some things you should take into consideration if you’re still unable to see the indicator: </p>
<p> The recipient blocked you. </p>
<p> The recipient has enabled Do Not Disturb or it is offline at the moment. </p>

<p> So, basically, the iMessage you’ve sent is stored on Apple’s servers and will remain there until it’s delivered. Once it’s delivered to a recipient, you should see the blue indicator. </p>
<p> If that’s not the case, you can try the following workarounds and, hopefully, resolve the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Make sure to enable the iMessage feature. Open Settings > Messages, and enable iMessage. </p>
<p> Make sure that you’re connected since the iMessage feature depends on connection. </p>
<p> Update your device to the latest version of iOS. </p>
<p> Resend the message. </p>
<p> After that, you should be able to receive the delivery reports again. Of course, as we already stated, this heavily depends on the recipient. So, make sure that everything works on both sides. </p>
<p> Finally, if you have any questions or suggestions, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. We’ll be glad to hear from you. Thanks for reading. </p>

<p> How to import Google Calendar to Outlook on Android </p>
<p> There are many Calendar solutions out there, but the two most prominent ones are certainly Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook. Now, many users are using both or are migrating from one platform to another. And many of them want to import Google Calendar to Outlook on their Android devices. </p>
<p> If you want to learn how to import Google Calendar to Outlook on Android (and vice versa), follow the steps we provided below. </p>
<p> How do I import Google Calendar to Outlook on Android? </p>
<p> Some people suggest to, in order to avoid clutter, users should avoid conjoining Google and Outlook calendars into one. And they are right to some extent, considering that both Google and Outlook calendars can function separately quite fine. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, we also see why one would want to combine all calendars into a single app. It’s easier to work, organize, and customize one calendar for all events than to navigate between the two separately. The question is what’s easier and better for you? </p>
<p> If you use Office365 apps on your Android device, it might be better to stick to Outlook Calendar. If you are using Google’s G Suite, it’s an obvious choice to stick to Google Calendar and import Outlook Calendar. </p>
<p> That’s not a rule of a thumb and you can still decide for one or the other, regardless of the office suite you are using. </p>
<p> Now, to import Google Calendar into Outlook for Android is not that hard. Follow these instructions to import Google Calendar into Outlook Calendar for Android: </p>
<p> Open Outlook on your Android device. </p>
<p> Tap Calendar. </p>
<p> Tap on the hamburger menu. </p>
<p> Now, tap on the Add calendar icon in the top left corner and select “Calendars on device“. </p>
<p> Check the boxes besides calendars you want to import and tap Add calendars. </p>
<p> Import all calendars you want to from your Google Account and that’s it. </p>
<p> Now, if you want to add an Outlook calendar to Google Calendar, you’ll need to do it via the web-based client. </p>
<p> How to import Outlook Calendar in Google Calendar </p>
<p> In order to make in-depth changes to Google Calendar, including importing calendars from different clients, you’ll need to log-in to Google Calendar on the Web. </p>
<p> This client is usually accessed via a browser on PCs, but you can run it in the Desktop mode on your Android. </p>
<p> But, before importing the ICS file that is an Outlook calendar, we need to navigate to Outlook desktop application and export the calendar there. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to export Outlook Calendar and import it into Google Calendar on the web: </p>
<p> Select Import/Export. </p>
<p> Name the calendar and save it with the .csv extension. </p>
<p> Now, open your Google Calendar for the Web in any browser, here, and sign in. </p>
<p> Under the Other calendars, click Plus (+) and choose Import. </p>
<p> Select the saved CSV file and import it to Google Calendar. </p>
<p> Now, you should be able to see that calendar on your Google Calendar for Android as well. </p>
<p> You’ll need third-party add-ons in order to sync calendars so this probably isn’t the best option for appointments. However, if the events are predetermined and re-occurring (birthdays or holidays), this approach should be great. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thanks for reading and, in case you have any questions or suggestions about Google Calendar or Outlook, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/improve-camera-pocophone-f1" parent_folder="web1" id="file17842420" filename="improve-camera-pocophone-f1">
<p> How to improve camera on Pocophone F1 </p>
<p> We cannot say the Pocophone F1 is exactly the phone of the year. But this phone is definitely the people’s champion! Because it simply serves the people. In the era when phone prices are going through the roof, the Poco F1 is keeping the balance by offering flagship specs for a budget price. And this is enough to give this phone the title of the most lovable phone of 2018. </p>
<p> I’m sure you’re quite familiar with the whole package already. You already know the whole amazing list of specs this phone brings to the table. But you also know all the compromises the manufacturer had to make to deliver this phone at such an amazing price. </p>
<p> Of course, the main drawback of this phone is its camera. The camera on this device is not necessarily bad, it’s actually quite decent. But it’s not on par with other premium features and specs of this phone. And that’s what everyone sticks to when comparing this phone to flagship devices. </p>
<p> But what if I tell you that you can have an even better camera on your Poco F1? That would make this phone even more appealing, and an absolute no-brainer if you’re in the market for a budget phone. If it’s not already. </p>
<p> All you have to do to significantly improve the Poco F1’s camera is a little software trick, that’s completely free of charge. After tweaking the software, the image quality will be significantly better, and you’ll really have a phone that does everything like a flagship device, but costs up to three times less. </p>
<p> How to improve Poco F1’s camera </p>
<p> It’s not the hardware that actually limits the performance of the Poco F1’s stock camera. It’s the software. That’s it, that’s the whole philosophy. Just replace the Xiaomi stock camera app with Google’s Camera, and you’ll notice a big difference in the image quality. </p>
<p> Simply put, and without diving into too many technical details, Google’s camera is better for processing images than the Xiaomi app, and uses the full potential of the Snapdragon 845 to deliver the best images for the given camera hardware. </p>
<p> A few months ago, installing Google Camera on the Poco F1 was relatively complicated. At least unless you’re familiar with rooting. Because, well, you had to root your phone to make the camera app work. And if you’re not into rooting and flashing custom ROMs, that wasn’t the most viable solution. </p>
<p> But now, thanks to a few dedicated developers, you can use Google Camera on your Poco F1 without rooting, just by installing the APK file. And that makes this whole process a whole lot easier. </p>
<p> The Poco F1 is still one of just a few Xiaomi phones that allows you to use Google Camera without unlocking the Bootloader. That’s because Google Camera requires Camera2 API support to work. And that’s the technology most Xiaomi phones don’t natively support. Luckily, the Pocophone F1 is not one of them. </p>
<p> Now, that’s enough pre-talk, let’s finally get down to business. </p>
<p> To install the Google Camera app, you just need to download the APK file from XDA developers forums, and you’re good to go. Since developers are quite active on improving the Google Camera port, I’m not going to post the APK download link here, because it will probably become outdated soon. </p>
<p> Instead, here’s the link to Google Camera Port Hub (just find Pocophone F1, and download the latest version of the app): </p>
<p> Here you’ll find the latest download links, as well as further instructions on installing and using the app. Additionally, you’ll also find the list of features that work or don’t work in the latest version of the app. Once again, I’m not going to include any of that info here, because it will likely become obsolete soon. </p>
<p> After downloading and installing the Google Camera APK, all you have to do is start taking pictures. You’ll probably need to tweak a few settings first, to get the best possible results, but that’ll require minimal effort. </p>
<p> And that’s about it. Now you can take significantly better images with the same Poco F1. As I already said, this will give the whole new dimension to the phone that already seems too good to be true. What more can you ask for? </p>
<p> If you have some questions about using the Google Camera app on the Pocophone F1, or you have some more Poco F1 customization tips, feel free to write them down in the comments below. </p>

<p> Google Camera gives terribly bad results compared to stock camera. Probably you never seen real photos from both cameras in full resolution – googles are very noisy, burned highlights and black shadows without details. An no 60fps UHD (it is available in stock camera). Only night shots in auto mode are better but still incomparable with night shots in manual mode in stock camera. </p>
<p> You have to enable these in GCAM : HDR+ 4*3 aspect ratio Ultrazoom resolution DCPI Color space </p>

<p> Improve your iPhone photos with Halide and RAW (DNG) </p>
<p> Throughout history, the iPhone has had exceptional camera systems. Combining the latest hardware with cutting-edge software, Apple’s always acted as the trendsetter in the mobile photography filed. </p>
<p> Even though the competition eventually caught up, and even slightly surpassed the iPhone with a few high-end models, the iPhone photos still have that characteristic feel that pleases many eyes. </p>
<p> But regardless of where they rank in the industry, the iPhone cameras are still smartphone cameras. This means, the iPhone snaps still can’t compete with those from professional, multi-thousand-dollar DSLR setups. However, the gap is getting smaller with each new generation, and we’re already at a point where photos from the iPhone 11 Pro or the Huawei P40 can trade a few blows with the professional cameras. They still can’t win the race, and probably never will, but the results are satisfying for an average user. </p>
<p> iPhone’s default camera (especially on the latest models) can capture decent shots out of the box. Just take your phone, shoot a few snaps, and even without any editing, you’ll end up with usable images. You can do that thanks to Apple’s advanced photo-processing algorithms and powerful chipsets (especially A13 Bionic). </p>
<p> On the other hand, as good as the stock camera app is, it’s still somewhat limited compared to premium third-party options. For example, you can’t take RAW photos with the stock camera, which is essential for creating high-quality photos just by using your iPhone. It almost feels like you’re not doing your phone justice by using just a portion of its snapping capabilities. </p>
<p> But not anymore, as I’ll lead you through the whole process of taking and editing high-quality photos on your iPhone. It requires a few extra steps and some basic editing skills, but the end result will make it worth every grey hair you grow in the process. </p>
<p> Use Halide to shoot RAW </p>
<p> There are numerous third-party apps in the App Store capable of shooting in RAW. However, I feel Halide is the best option because of its wide range of advanced features that still come in a simple-to-use package. It allows you to control every important aspect of your image (white balance, bokeh, exposure, ISO, etc.) without feeling overwhelmed by a complex interface. And of course, it exports RAW. </p>
<p> When you open Halide, it welcomes you with a standard camera-app interface. There’s an auto/manual focus button, ISO, AWB, Histogram, etc. I won’t talk about each of these features individually, as the article would’ve been too broad. If you want to make the most out of it, it’s a good idea to run through Halide’s in-app tutorials that explain how each feature of the app work. You can find the tutorials under Settings > How-To and Support. </p>
<p> The most important thing for our guide is to make sure shooting RAW is enabled. It should be by default, but just to make sure, head over to Settings > Advanced Settings, and enable Save RAW + Processed Image. </p>
<p> Once you make sure everything’s in place, just point your phone at something, and shoot a few photos. The camera will shoot both JPEG and RAW, and you can preview both versions in Halide’s photo library. The buttons in the upper-right corner will tell you which version is on the screen. You’ll immediately notice that the RAW version looks worse at first glance, usually underexposed or blown out. But that how it should be, we’ll get to it later. </p>
<p> To save the RAW version to your internal memory, tap the Share button, and choose RAW. </p>
<p> Okay, so you have your RAW photo now, and it looks terrible. What now? Let’s first explain what RAW actually is and what to do with it once you take a snap. </p>
<p> What is RAW and why you should be using it? </p>
<p> When you press the shutter button on a camera, in this case your iPhone, the process goes something like this: the lens captures every single bit of information inside the frame, your phone then uses a string of algorithms to process the image, and exports it as JPEG. You’re probably familiar with the JPEG extension, as it’s a universally used image format that works across most devices. </p>
<p> But as I said, a JPEG image is a heavily processed image. Your phone (camera) processes the original sample to deliver the best possible result, and most importantly, optimize its size so it doesn’t take up too much storage space. You’re, more or less, ending up with a finished product. </p>
<p> Because of that, a JPEG image loses most of its original flexibility. To achieve the best possible optimization, algorithms usually get rid of the “unnecessary” details, which then limits your possibilities in editing. </p>
<p> But you can skip the processing part altogether, and export the image in its original state. Those uncompressed photos come in the RAW format. A RAW image preserves all the precious detail and data the lens originally captured, which gives you much more freedom in post. You should also keep in mind that a RAW image is multiple times larger than a JPEG. So I recommend only keeping them briefly. Once you edit a RAW image, your app will export it as a much lighter JPEG, so there’s no need of piling them up in your storage. </p>
<p> You’ll notice that a RAW version of your photo doesn’t look nearly “as good” as JPEG. It looks unpolished, under(over)exposed, and generally doesn’t have a nice feeling to it. But what it does have is all the information your camera originally captured. All the information your device didn’t get rid of while processing the photo. And that’s precisely what we need. </p>
<p> We can say a RAW photo looks exactly like what it really is. An incomplete output that’s waiting for you to apply the finishing touches. </p>
<p> Why are RAW photos on the iPhone shown as DNG? </p>
<p> Okay, now you know what RAW is all about, and you’ve taken and exported a few photos to your phone. But when you find them in the Photos app, you’ll notice the photos use the.DNG extension. RAW is nowhere to be found. </p>
<p> That’s because RAW is not an actual file format. It’s a generally used term for uncompressed image files, so it doesn’t stand for anything. Different camera manufacturers use their own file formats. For example, Canon uses .CR2, Nikon uses .NEF for its RAW files, etc. All these file formats fall under the RAW hood. </p>
<p> Apple uses the DNG file extension for the iPhone, which is essentially just “another version” of RAW. It was created by Adobe as a proprietary image standard, so it can be used in a generic manner, unlike the above-mentioned manufacturer-specific RAW formats. Obviously, DNG works in all Adobe applications, which is important for the last step of our guide. </p>
<p> Finish in Lightroom </p>
<p> And now the most exciting (read: nerve-racking) part of our journey. You’ve taken your RAW photo and you know its backstory. Now it’s time to turn this ugly, under-exposed duckling into a beautiful, bright swan. </p>
<p> I use Lightroom to edit all my photos because it’s the most advanced, most complete photo editing app you can have on your smartphone. You don’t even need the premium version, as most edits can be done in the base app. If for some reason, you don’t like Lightroom, there are good alternatives like Snapseed that will give you similar results. It’s really up to you which app you’ll choose. </p>
<p> But, here’s the catch. I can’t tell you exactly what to do. Photography, and especially photo-editing isn’t an exact science. There’s no magic formula or a set of instructions that will make your photos look good, because no photo is the same, and what applies for one, doesn’t have to work for another. </p>
<p> To take full advantage of your photos, you’ll have to learn a thing or two about editing in general. After that, you’ll need to get to know Lightroom (or any other app) better, in order to apply that knowledge. </p>
<p> Now, if you know absolutely nothing about photography in the first place, don’t get discouraged. While mastering every aspect of this craft takes countless hours (years) of hard work, you can crack the basics relatively fast. Of course, you won’t become the next Robert Capa, but you’ll get relatively satisfying results after just a few days of playing around with sliders in Lightroom. At least your photos will be better than your friends’ photos, who probably just know how to take a selfie and apply a filter before uploading to Instagram. </p>
<p> Just remember that if you find yourself to be passionate about photography, keep working and learning, and I’m sure your style will get finer with each new photo you take. </p>
<p> I’ll take myself for example. Before writing this post, I knew absolutely nothing about photo-editing. So, I watched a few videos and read a few articles while preparing this article, and I can say that I’m satisfied with the shots I captured. And we’re talking just a few days of practice. </p>
<p> Here are a few photos I took and edited specifically for this article. </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram “Could not refresh feed” in Android </p>
<p> There’s barely a worse feeling in today’s world than being unable to satisfy your social media cravings. Unfortunately, as social media platforms are apps/websites, technical issues do occur. And when you experience such a problem, you get stuck between the feelings of disappointment and constant anticipation. </p>
<p> But we’re not here to psycho-analyze you. You’re a social animal, and nobody judges you. We all are, after all. We’re here to resolve your problem; Or at least explain what’s going on. </p>
<p> So, don’t panic when that “Instagram could not load feed” issue appears. The problem will be resolved, sooner or later. So, keep reading this article to find out more about this problem, and maybe a solution to resolve it. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Do nothing and wait for updates </p>
<p> In 90% percent of the cases, it’s not you – it’s Instagram. You’ve probably installed a bad update that actually broke the app, instead of improving it. That’s not uncommon, as app updates tend to disrupt the apps. That’s simply how it works. After all, nobody’s perfect, and developers make mistakes, as well. </p>
<p> If the app stopped working by itself, there’s really nothing you can do about it. You’ll have to wait for Instagram developers to release a patch. I’m sorry, but that’s just the way it is. The good thing about this is that Instagram is a huge company, with a lot of developers involved. So, it might not be long until they acknowledge the issue and receive a fixing update. You shouldn’t be waiting for it more than a day or two. </p>
<p> You’ll probably receive the update automatically. Some users even reported that the issue ‘magically’ fixed itself overnight. However, you can also check for updates in the Play Store, from time to time. </p>
<p> Since a bad update is probably the culprit here, probably none of the following solutions will help you. But you can still execute them while waiting for the update, just to be sure. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear the app cache </p>
<p> Clearing the app’s cache is one of the most widely-recommended solutions you can find for just about any app-related problem. It probably won’t help, but it might sometimes. Even though Android Oreo changed the way we clear the cached data, you can still clear Instagram cache relatively easy. </p>
<p> Here’s how: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Storage > Other apps > Instagram. </p>
<p> Tap Clear cache (you might as well Clear data). </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Check your internet connection </p>
<p> It goes without saying that neither Instagram nor any other internet-dependent app will work without a stable internet connection. So, if you’re not able to connect to the internet using Chrome or any other app, you know what the problem is. </p>
<p> If the internet connection is indeed the issue here, check out this article for some more troubleshooting tips. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall the app </p>
<p> Reinstallation is another native troubleshooting method. Just like it’s the case with clearing the app cache, it might be helpful sometimes. On top of that, when you reinstall the app, you may hit the right timing and install an updated version of the app. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reinstall the Instagram app in Android: </p>
<p> Open the Play Store, and search for Instagram. </p>
<p> On the Instagram store page, tap the Uninstall button. </p>
<p> Wait for the app to reinstall. </p>
<p> Reboot your phone. </p>
<p> Now, head back to the Store and install Instagram again. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Log out from Instagram in a browser </p>
<p> For some strange reason, that is unknown to me, logging in and out from Instagram in a browser solved the problem for some users. Although I don’t know what’s going on, it certainly won’t hurt if you try this, if none of the previous solutions resolved the problem. </p>
<p> So, just go to your browser either on your Android phone or Desktop, log in to Instagram, and log out. Maybe it’ll resolve the issue. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope this article helped you understand why you’re not able to see that amazing new content from your Instagram feed. As I said multiple times in this article, don’t worry, because the app will probably fix itself, and the “Instagram could not refresh feed” issue will just disappear. </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram notifications not working </p>
<p> Imagine having an app you use to interact with people daily but the phone won’t alert you at all. This is what some users reported about Instagram, as the Instagram notifications are seemingly not working for many. </p>
<p> Continue reading and do as instructed to resolve this problem swiftly. </p>
<p> How to fix Instagram notifications on Android </p>
<p> The most common reasons for Instagram notification issues are disabled notifications in System Settings, although the problem might lie in corrupted cache or aggressive system optimization. </p>
<p> If you are not getting Instagram notifications on your device, just try to restart it once. If the problem persists, we’ll need to use some applicable troubleshooting steps. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Inspect both in-app and system settings </p>
<p> The first thing to do is to thoroughly inspect both in-app and system notification settings for Instagram. If you are certain that Instagram is the only app having issues with the push or Direct Message notifications, we’ll focus on Instagram solely. There are reports about notifications turning off after a system update. Let’s turn them on again. </p>
<p> As a side note, if you have global issues with notifications, make sure that notifications are enabled in Settings > Notifications. </p>
<p> Now, let’s focus on Instagram. Follow these steps to check notification settings for Instagram: </p>
<p> Open Instagram. </p>
<p> Tap on your Profile and then on the hamburger menu. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Notifications. </p>
<p> Make sure to open each section, starting with “Posts, Stories and Comments” and moving downwards, and enable notifications. </p>
<p> Now, open Settings > Notifications. </p>
<p> Locate Instagram and open it from the list. </p>
<p> Make sure that notifications, sound, and lock screen notifications are allowed. </p>
<p> Furthermore, inspect each section below and ensure that everything is enabled. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear Instagram’s cache and data </p>
<p> This solution is especially applicable to mega cache hoarders that are all social media apps, including Instagram. They tend to pile up lots of cache and data which will indeed preload your feed faster. </p>
<p> But, first of all, everything is stored in the cloud (messages, post history, drafts, etc.). Second of all, that excess of locally stored data might cause issues. </p>
<p> Therefore, let’s clear cache and data from Instagram and hopefully, notifications will start coming through again. Follow these steps to clear cache and data on Instagram: </p>
<p> Open Instagram from the list of apps. </p>
<p> Select Storage. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Whitelist Instagram </p>
<p> One of the main negatives of OEM skins like MIUI or EMUI is quite an aggressive app management. To improve battery life, system managers will terminate apps or limit their work in the background. Battery optimization included. </p>
<p> That’s why we must suggest either disabling those built-in optimization measures or whitelisting Instagram. That way, Instagram will keep working in the background and push notifications should come through without issues. </p>
<p> Look for System Manager, Security, and whitelist Instagram. In addition, here’s how to change Battery optimization and allow Instagram to autostart on Android: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps (Manage apps) > Instagram. </p>
<p> Enable Autostart. </p>
<p> Then open Battery saver. </p>
<p> Make sure to either disable battery optimization for Instagram or set it to a mode that allows background activity. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall Instagram </p>
<p> Besides clearing the cache and data or securing that the app works in the background, you can also go for the reinstall. With the reinstallation, you’ll get the latest version of the app while clearing all settings. This is applicable for both Android and iOS. </p>
<p> Open the Play Store and look for Instagram. </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and go back to the Play Store. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Disable Do not disturb mode </p>
<p> This might come as something too obvious, but you might’ve accidentally enabled Do not disturb mode. Based on the ways its configured, DND mode will prevent all or particular notifications from coming through. </p>
<p> If you are unsure whether it’s ON, you should see an icon in the top right corner that’s usually not there. Disabling DND can be done from the Quick Access menu, but we made sure to explain how to do it through system Settings. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open Sound & vibration. </p>
<p> Tap Silent/DND. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Leave the Instagram Beta program </p>
<p> The Instagram Beta program is one of the most popular testing grounds on the Play Store. It’s mostly stable and it does bring some nifty features before the public release hits the deck. However, we still encourage you to leave the beta program in case you are experiencing any problems. Going back to the latest public release is worth a try. </p>
<p> Here’s how to leave the Instagram Beta program with ease: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for Instagram. </p>
<p> Scroll down and, under the You’re a beta tester section, tap Leave. </p>
<p> Wait until you are excluded from the Beta program and update the app. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Try an older APK version of Instagram </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous solutions worked and you are certain that notifications are enabled, maybe the problem is in the app. We all know how to update an app, but what about downgrading it to an older bug-free version? That’s also possible, but only with third-party providers of APKs (Android Package). </p>
<p> Follow these steps to install an older version of Instagram and, hopefully, Instagram notifications that were not working will work without problems: </p>
<p> Uninstall Instagram. </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror, here, and download an older version of Instagram. </p>
<p> Allow your browser to install third-party apps from unrecognized sources. </p>
<p> Install the APK and look for improvements. </p>
<p> With that said, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to tell us if these steps helped you or you are still bothered with Instagram notifications not working. The comments section is just below. </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram not working on Wi-Fi </p>
<p> In recent years, Instagram really took the world by storm. This photo-sharing social app has become a go-to social network, with the integration of Snapchat-like Stories and IGTV service. However, there are still years-old issues plaguing users, like common reports about Instagram not working on Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> If your Instagram feed won’t load or Direct Messages won’t send messages on Wi-Fi, continue reading below. </p>
<p> Why my Instagram is not working on Wi-Fi? </p>
<p> The most important thing when dealing with a problem like this is to determine whether the problem is isolated or it affects a lot of users. </p>
<p> Instagram is an enormous service with 500+ millions of daily users. Servers crash, server-side updates break things — it’s not unusual for Instagram to be down for some time. </p>
<p> Once you are sure that the issue is on your side, try the steps below to get Instagram to work on Wi-Fi again. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check for Instagram service outage on DownDetector </p>
<p> Sadly, Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram are not informing users when outages, maintenance, or similar important operations occur. Operations that render the service unusable for many users. </p>
<p> Luckily, there are third-party services that work on peer reports about a variety of services, including Instagram. The go-to website for that is DownDetector. So, navigate to DownDetector, here, and find out whether other people reported Instagram not working on Wi-Fi or similar issues. </p>
<p> If the problem is widespread, you can, for the time being, use Mobile Data, sit tight, and wait. On the other hand, if the problem is not widely acknowledged, continue with the steps below. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Thoroughly inspect your Wireless network </p>
<p> This is self-explanatory. I had a hard time chatting and sending multimedia via Direct messages a couple of months ago while using my antiquated wireless router. The moment I switch to Mobile Data — everything works seamlessly. Once I replaced the router, wireless issues were all gone. </p>
<p> Now, there are all other things to consider here. Your router might be fine, but consider temporarily disabling all other devices on that network. If the problem persists, reset your modem and router. </p>
<p> Try using different apps on your device that are dependent on a wireless connection, try downloading something, or test the network by installing the Speedtest.net app from the Play Store. </p>
<p> If all other home devices work without issues and you can single out your Android device as the one with connectivity issues, make sure to reboot it. You can also enable the Airplane mode for a minute or so and then disable it. </p>
<p> Finally, you can reset Network settings. Here’s how to do it on basically any Android device: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Connection & sharing. </p>
<p> Scroll down and open “Reset WLAN, mobile networks, and Bluetooth“. </p>
<p> Tap Reset settings. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear Instagram cache and data </p>
<p> The third step requires clearing cache and data from the Instagram app. We all know how Facebook and Instagram pile up data with ease. They cache the pages in order to load faster the next time you start scrolling. </p>
<p> An abundance of locally-stored cache might and will eventually lead to app issues. That’s why we recommend clearing it before giving reinstallation a try. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from Instagram: </p>
<p> Open Instagram from the list of apps. </p>
<p> Select Storage. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall the app </p>
<p> In case the problem is persistent, the next thing you can do is reinstall Instagram. We are well aware that this isn’t much different than the previous step, but your troubleshooting options are rather limited. By reinstalling the app, you’ll get the latest version and a clean start. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reinstall Instagram for Android: </p>
<p> Open the Play Store and look for Instagram. </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and go back to the Play Store. </p>
<p> Install Instagram again. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Leave Beta program or try an older APK </p>
<p> Alternatively, if you have enrolled in the Instagram Beta program, make sure to leave it. There are indeed advantages of having early access to new features but those versions are usually not as stable as the public ones. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to leave the Beta program: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for Instagram. </p>
<p> Scroll down and, under the You’re a beta tester section, tap Leave. </p>
<p> Wait until you are excluded from the Beta program and update the app. </p>
<p> On the other hand, you can go for an older version by downgrading Instagram via APK. These APKs come from third-party sources so many users are skeptical about them. However, if the problem started with a recent update, installing an older version should fix it for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to install an older Instagram APK: </p>
<p> Uninstall Instagram. </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror, here, and download an older version of Instagram. </p>
<p> Allow your browser to install third-party apps from unrecognized sources. </p>
<p> Install the APK and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Access Instagram via the browser </p>
<p> Finally, although it lacks some functionality, you can temporarily use Instagram for the web as an alternative. Have in mind that you’ll need to enable the Desktop mode on Chrome or alternative browser in order to avoid being redirected to the Play Store automatically. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to access Instagram for the Web on your Android: </p>
<p> Open Chrome on your Android device. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and check the Desktop site box. </p>
<p> Navigate to Instagram for the Web, here, and log in with your credentials. </p>
<p> That’s a wrap. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to tell us if these instructions helped you resolve the issue with Instagram on Wi-Fi. You can do so in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram Videos Not Playing On Android </p>
<p> Instagram has become an integral part of the ever-growing social networks family. Besides standard photos, you’re also able to share short GIF-like videos. If the picture is worth 1000 words, the video must be worth a bit more, does it? </p>
<p> While Instagram rarely has stability issues, the video playback can get stuck from time to time. Additionally, that can lead to app crash or instability or nervous breakdowns. So, if you are experiencing video issues, you’ve come to the right spot. Let’s try and resolve this issue together and get those videos up and running. </p>
<p> Update Instagram app </p>
<p> The first step you should take is updating your Instagram app. Most of the time, the problem lies in outdated version. Because of that, make sure you have the latest version at any given time. The auto-update should do the job for you, but you can look up for updates manually, too. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Tap Menu. </p>
<p> Look up for Instagram in Update tab. </p>
<p> Choose to update. </p>
<p> Once it’s done, open Instagram and try playing videos. </p>
<p> In case the videos still won’t play, let’s try additional steps. </p>
<p> Clear Instagram app cache and data </p>
<p> As same as the most of the apps do, Instagram stores a lot of data on your phone. With particular settings, every picture or video you post can be preserved on the phone storage or SD card. Moreover, there’s a lot of cache files that may slow down the app gradually and impact video playback. </p>
<p> According to that, your next step should be clearing cache and data from the Instagram app. Follow these instructions to clear Data and Cache. </p>
<p> Clear Cache and Data. </p>
<p> Some users use specific apps for automatic clearing of cache. However, we advise you not to use them. Firstly, they take your storage space, and secondly, they tend to work in the background and slow down all-around performance. Simply put, that kind of apps are more disadvantage than a valid tool. </p>
<p> Reinstall Instagram </p>
<p> Sometimes the apps may stuck because of some kind of the corruption. Software sometimes has a mind of its own and the only viable solution is reinstallation. So, if you’ve tried previous steps and the videos still won’t load, try this out. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Most of the time, this should resolve your issue. Of course, if the software is an issue. However, sometimes the connection may play the main part in this Instagram wrongdoings. Move on to the next step to troubleshoot the connection. </p>
<p> Restart Wi-Fi router </p>
<p> Some users reported on various forums that the Instagram videos work on Wi-Fi but won’t work on mobile data and vice versa. So, the first step is to restart your Wi-Fi router. Turn it off, wait a minute or so, and then turn it on. </p>
<p> Additionally, you may want to update router firmware and change from 5 GHz band to 2.4 GHz. Even though the 5 GHz supports higher speeds, it’s signal isn’t as reliable as 2.4 GHz over distance. That, of course, is not an issue with dual-band routers. </p>
<p> Reset your Network settings </p>
<p> Once you’ve tweaked your router, let’s reset network settings on the phone. That should fix common connection bugs and let you start from the scratch. Have in mind that you’ll need to reestablish the settings again. </p>
<p> Choose Network Settings Reset. </p>
<p> Tap RESET SETTINGS. </p>
<p> Turn off Power-saving mode </p>
<p> Thanks to one of our readers, we obtained another workaround that just may be the one that resolves the problem. He resolved the problem by disabling the Power-saving mode, that somehow interferes with the Instagram videos playback. So, navigate to Power settings, disable Power-saving mode and your problem should be sorted out. </p>
<p> Thanks a lot to Matt that suggested this solution. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. In case you have any additional problems with Instagram, please be free to tell us in the comments, or reach us out on Twitter. We’ll do our best to help you resolve them. </p>

<p> It seems that the simple fact that Power Saving Mode is enabled stops most videos from playing. Even adding an exception doesn’t seem to render positive results. The same applies for many third-party IG apps as well, especially older apps. </p>
<p> Were you able to resolve it? </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram videos not playing on iOS </p>
<p> No matter if you’re a celebrity with a few million followers, a photo enthusiast or a selfie addict, there is a large chance you’ll be using Instagram. This photo-sharing app outgrows its primary concept and now is an important part of everyday digital life. As saying goes ‘Photo say a thousand words’, and Instagram has all the tools needed to share your story. </p>
<p> The dynamic nature of Instagram lets you interact in more ways than just with photos of your loved pets or a meal or a night out with friends. Namely, now you can record your favorite moments and share videos long up to 16 seconds. However, so many users had a problem with Instagram videos playback that we decided to compile a list of possible solutions. </p>
<p> So, if you have any issues with Instagram videos on your iOS handset, there are a few workarounds below you should take into consideration. </p>
<p> Troubleshoot router </p>
<p> Before you take any further steps, we should rule out the router from the list of causes. Namely, let’s firstly check the exterior causes and then move on to the device itself. These are some steps you can take to troubleshoot your router. </p>
<p> Reboot the router. Turn it off. Wait for a minute or so. Turn it on. </p>
<p> Check connectivity with other devices. </p>
<p> Check cables. </p>
<p> Look out for overheating. Make sure to place your router far from heat sources. </p>
<p> Restore router to factory settings. </p>
<p> Replace the router. </p>
<p> Restart/hard restart your device </p>
<p> The first step in any troubleshooting procedure for iOS must be the restart. Most of the technicians will tell you to ‘turn your device on/off’. So, it may seem like a prepared phrase, but in this case, it may indeed help. Maybe it’s just a temporary glitch and a brief restart should take care of it. </p>
<p> However, besides standard ‘turn off/on’ sequence, you can use force restart, as well. To perform a hard reset, follow these instructions. </p>
<p> Press and hold Sleep/Wake button and Home button combined until you see the Apple logo. </p>
<p> Wait for the device to start. It may take more time than usual. </p>
<p> If you have iPhone 7 and 7+, press Sleep/Wake and Volume Down buttons. </p>
<p> Update Instagram </p>
<p> Your Instagram app must be up to date. We are talking about one of the leading developing teams in the market (Facebook app not included). There’s a great chance that the latest update brings some bug fix that will resolve your issues. So, check for updates. </p>
<p> Open App Store app. </p>
<p> Look for available updates. </p>
<p> Tap Update All or single out Instagram. </p>
<p> In case you’re still experiencing issues with Instagram videos, move down trough list of workarounds. </p>
<p> Reinstall Instagram </p>
<p> The next step you should take is reinstallation. Even though the Instagram stability is rarely questioned, some unusual glitches occur from time to time. This procedure will clear all stored data and cache, so follow the instructions. </p>
<p> Tap and hold the Instagram app until ‘X’ shows. </p>
<p> Press X and delete the Instagram app. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Open App Store and search for Instagram or you can access Purchased apps in Update menu. </p>
<p> Tap on Install. </p>
<p> After the installation, log in to Instagram and try out videos. </p>
<p> Disable Autoplay </p>
<p> Some users managed to solve video issues by disabling the Autoplay. It seems that, for some of the users with older devices, the Autoplay smothered video playback. However, Instagram removed ‘Disable Auto Play’ for unapparent reasons so you’ll still have videos preloaded while connected via Wi-Fi. At least you can prevent preloading on mobile data and this is how. </p>
<p> Open Instagram app. </p>
<p> Tap Options. </p>
<p> Choose Cellular Data Use. </p>
<p> Tap Use Less Data. </p>
<p> Look out for improvements in video playback. With that, we can conclude that the Instagram isn’t the culprit for video issues. Let’s move on to the network. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings </p>
<p> So, if the Instagram app is live and kicking, your problems are, most of the time, related to the connection. If the connection is unstable or slow, your videos simply won’t load properly. Consequently, your videos won’t start or the playback will be glitchy. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi is always more stable and much more reliable than mobile data, but if you’re on the move and relying on your data, you should reset your Cellular data settings. Have in mind that this operation will wipe all your settings and return them to a factory values. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open Cellular. </p>
<p> Tap Cellular Data Network. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Settings. </p>
<p> If you’re mostly using Wi-Fi to browse Instagram and experiencing issues with videos, you can restore complete network settings to a factory values. This will wipe out all your settings, remembered Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections. If you have some specific values, make sure to write them down before wipe out occurs. </p>
<p> Choose Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Network Settings. </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram won’t connect to Facebook on Android </p>
<p> Once Facebook, Inc. acquired Instagram a couple of years ago, they made sure to work on the integration and unifying both social networks they own. You can share Instagram posts and stories on Facebook and vice versa without hustle. You can also use Facebook to log into Instagram. </p>
<p> However, there seems to be a problem with this integration for some users as they state that Instagram won’t connect to Facebook. If you are experiencing this problem yourself, make sure to continue reading and we’ll sort it out. </p>
<p> Instagram won’t connect or share to Facebook </p>
<p> There’s a variety of reasons why Instagram won’t connect or share posts or stories to Facebook. First of all, ensure that you are signed to the Facebook account you already linked to Instagram and that your accounts are not temporary or permanently terminated. </p>
<p> If you are sure everything is right but still have a problem, follow the steps below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear cache and data from both apps and try again </p>
<p> Let’s start by clearing cache and data in both apps. After that, you should sign in again to your Facebook account and try logging into Instagram via Facebook. Both apps tend to pile a lot of locally stored data and cache which, in the long run, can cause issues. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from Facebook and Instagram: </p>
<p> Now, sign into Instagram with the Facebook Log-In option and try sharing any post or story to see whether the issue is still present. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Un-link the Facebook account and link it again </p>
<p> The next step to take is to unlink the Facebook account and link it again with Instagram. There might be a temporary problem with the interlinking between Facebook services at the moment. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to unlink the Facebook account to Instagram and link it again: </p>
<p> Now, open the hamburger menu and choose Settings. </p>
<p> Select Account. </p>
<p> Close Instagram and navigate back to Linked Accounts > Facebook. </p>
<p> Link your account again. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Check whether Sharing options are enabled </p>
<p> If you are able to sign into Instagram with Facebook but unable to share stories or posts, make sure to check Sharing options. Usually, there’s a prompt informing you that you can share all posts and stories to Facebook. </p>
<p> However, there’s a chance that you skipped on the prompt or accidentally declined it. So, what you need to do is enable it and everything should work without problems. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to enable Instagram Stories and Posts sharing to Facebook: </p>
<p> Navigate to Instagram > Profile > Settings > Account > Linked Accounts. </p>
<p> Select Facebook and make sure that the right Facebook account is linked to Instagram. </p>
<p> Now, just enable Share Your Story to Facebook and Share Your Posts to Facebook. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall both apps </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the aforementioned solutions worked, we suggest reinstalling both apps and trying again. Of course, after the reinstall, navigate to Instagram Settings and change share options. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reinstall Instagram and Facebook with ease: </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall. </p>
<p> Search for Facebook and uninstall it as well. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and go back to the Play Store. </p>
<p> Firstly, log into Facebook and then use Facebook to sign into Instagram. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. If the problem persists, you can send a report ticket to Instagram, here. Thank you for reading and if you have any related issues besides Instagram that won’t connect to Facebook, make sure to tell us in the comments section. We are always keen to try and help. </p>

<p> Fix: Instagram won’t let me log in </p>
<p> With over 500 million daily users, Instagram is the most popular social network today. Android and iOS apps are highly rated and both work well most of the time. However, there are numerous reports from users saying that Instagram won’t let them log in. </p>
<p> If you tried to log in multiple times but the problem persists, we have some solutions for you. </p>
<p> Why can’t I log into my Instagram? </p>
<p> If we exclude some server-side issues, accessing and using Instagram on your phone should work seamlessly most of the time. The whole thing about Instagram is to gain access as fast as possible. However, the problem might occur due to a bug, connection issues, or wrong credentials. </p>
<p> So, here are certain things you should check to ensure that the issue is not on your side. Learn more below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Double-check the credentials </p>
<p> Most of the time, the most obvious solution is also the best one. If you have a log-in issue, start by double-checking your credentials. </p>
<p> If you have the Facebook app installed, you can use it to log into Instagram. Otherwise, use your email address (preferably over the user name) and try signing in again. </p>
<p> If the issue persists, make sure to continue following the steps below until we sort it out. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear data and check the connection </p>
<p> Instagram, like any other app, can occasionally misbehave due to pilled up cache. Social media apps, like Facebook or Instagram, tend to store a lot of data locally and that can lead to issues sometimes. So, let’s clear the cache/data and try logging into Instagram again: </p>
<p> Select Storage. </p>
<p> Additionally, ensure that your phone is connected to Wi-Fi or the mobile data is enabled. Alternatively, reboot your device and check for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reset password </p>
<p> Now, if the problem is still there and Instagram won’t allow you to log in, you can always try and reset the password. You can do so in two ways, via the email address or via SMS, considering you have your phone number assigned to your IG account. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reset your Instagram password: </p>
<p> Open Instagram. </p>
<p> On the Login Screen, select Get help signing in. </p>
<p> Enter your email, phone number, or user name. We’ll be using Email as its universal and doesn’t require linking your phone number to an Instagram account. </p>
<p> Now, based on your choice and available options, you can use one of the Reset options. We went for the email and got an instant link that will log you in immediately. Just make sure to, when prompted, select the Instagram app to open the link. </p>
<p> Change your password and try logging in again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Leave the Beta program </p>
<p> If you enrolled in the Instagram Beta program, we suggest leaving it and checking for improvements. Even though Beta releases are not exactly riddled with bugs, they are, obviously, not as stable as the public ones. </p>
<p> Here’s how to leave Instagram Beta from the Google Play Store: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for Instagram. </p>
<p> Scroll down and, under the You’re a beta tester section, tap Leave. </p>
<p> Wait until you are excluded from the Beta program and update the app. </p>
<p> Reboot your phone and try to log in again. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Try logging into the web-based client </p>
<p> This isn’t exactly a solution but a way to check that your account isn’t suspended or terminated by Instagram. </p>
<p> There are some instances where certain users were able to log into Instagram on their phone app after logging into the web-based client. Open Chrome, enable Desktop mode and navigate here and log in with your email and password. </p>
<p> In addition, you can use the web-based client to reset the password. For some reason, Instagram hides a lot of options in the web-based client, although the majority of users use this social media exclusively on Android or iOS. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Send a ticket to Instagram support </p>
<p> Finally, if you went through all troubleshooting steps and Instagram still won’t allow you to log in, make sure to send a report ticket to Instagram support. After your inquiry, they should inform you about possible reasons for the problem at hand. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to describe your Instagram-related issues in the comments section below. We might be able to help you out. </p>

<p> How to install Fortnite on Android (and is it safe) </p>
<p> Epic Games recently made a bet on itself that Google will find Fortnite too irresistible and allow it to the Play Store with a special treatment on top. Namely, Google takes a hefty share of 30% from developers on all-in app purchases made through its platform. These are the rules developers must follow if they want their apps in the Play Store. </p>
<p> However, Epic Games counted on Fortnite’s millions of players to be its ticket around Google’s regulations and submitted the game to Google Play in the hopes of a special exception to the 30% rule. Google rejected the proposal. </p>
<p> As it appears now, neither Google nor Epic Games will ease up on their original stands, which means Fortnite is unlikely to appear in the Play Store anytime soon. </p>
<p> What does it mean for Fortnite players who want to enjoy the game on their Android devices? Well, while iOS users can download Fortnite from the App Store, Android users will have to go down another route, which may be fine for some, but others will probably have a few questions about the legitimacy of the process. </p>
<p> Let’s break it down. </p>
<p> Fortnite for Android system requirements </p>
<p> Fortnite is not a regular Android game you play while sitting on a toilet. It’s a full-fledged PC/console game scaled down to work on a handheld device. And as such, it requires a lot of resources to run smoothly on your Android phone. </p>
<p> That being said, you’ll probably need a flagship device to even be able to run Fortnite. The official list of requirements is as follows: </p>
<p> Android 8.0 or newer </p>
<p> At least 4GB of RAM </p>
<p> 64-bit Android running on an ARM64 processor. </p>
<p> One of the following GPUs: Adreno 530 or higher, Mali-G71 MP20, Mali-G72 MP12 or higher. </p>
<p> How to install Fortnite on Android </p>
<p> As Fortnite isn’t available in the Play Store, Epic Games opted for a method called sideloading. Although it sounds complicated, it’s basically a name for installing an app from a source other than the OS’ official app store (Google Play Store). So, you’re probably familiar with the concept. </p>
<p> However, installing Fortnite is a bit different from installing other APK (Android Package Kit) files. You need to download Epic Games APK file, install the app, and use it to download Fortnite. </p>
<p> Install Epic Games APK </p>
<p> A pop-up will warn you that “this type of file may harm your device.” Ignore the warning, and tap OK. </p>
<p> Now, open the APK file. </p>
<p> Another pop-up will say that “for your security, your phone is not allowed to install unknown apps from this source.” Ignore this one as well, and check Allow from this source. </p>
<p> And the final pop-up will tell you “Do you want to install this application? It does not require special access.” Approve and finish the installation. </p>
<p> Download and install Fortnite </p>
<p> Open the Epic Games app. </p>
<p> If your device is compatible, the option to install Fortnite will appear. </p>
<p> Tap the Install button. </p>
<p> Allow Epic Games to access your device’s photos, media, and files. The app will start downloading. It may take a while to download the app, since the core is around 400MB. </p>
<p> Now, proceed with setting up Fortnite on your Android device: </p>
<p> Open Fortnite. </p>
<p> Grant the necessary permissions. </p>
<p> If your phone is running a newer version of Android (Android 10, for example), you’ll get a message that the app was built for older versions of Android. Ignore the message, as you shouldn’t have any problems running Fortnite on your phone, anyway. </p>
<p> Log into your Epic games account. </p>
<p> Download the rest of the game (around 5.6GB). </p>
<p> Is the Fortnite APK safe? </p>
<p> Now, let’s get to the main point of this dispute. Why would Epic Games even want Fortnite in the Play Store, and why do so many people care about it? </p>
<p> First, let’s get obvious out of the way. And that’s, of course, the reach Google Play has. It’s probably the only app store (or more precisely, a place to download apps from) an average Android user visits. If you want as many people as possible to know about your app, you put it in the Play Store. That’s clear to everybody, so there’s no need to discuss it further. </p>
<p> Another important component in the equation, and the most important one here, is security. It is generally considered that apps that come from Google Play are safe and trustworthy, as Google keeps investing big in security features that should keep the store as clean as possible. </p>
<p> On the other hand, apps from third-party sources are not checked for vulnerabilities. That’s why it’s easier for hackers to exploit a third-party APK and hijack your phone. These risks are the reason installing third-party APKs is not enabled by default on Android devices. </p>
<p> However, the Fortnite APK is different from shady APKs of cracked premium apps people occasionally download from fishy websites. The whole team of developers stands behind it, as Epic Games knows how much people value security these days. So they don’t want to lose potential users by allowing some vulnerability to slip through. Right? </p>
<p> Check Point also found a bug in Fortnite’s infrastructure, per ZDNet, that could allow attackers to access user accounts. According to some reports, over 9 million accounts were hacked. </p>
<p> Now, back to the statement that Epic Games is a big company. All the vulnerabilities have been patched since, and we haven’t had a report on Fortnite security issues in over 10 months. We can also assume that the company has learned from its mistakes, as it stepped up its security game to prevent further trouble. </p>
<p> In the end, it all comes down to your personal preference. If you care about playing Fotnite on your Android phone, you can bet on Epic Games and hope attackers won’t find their way around the code. If you don’t like the whole sideloading idea, and have more trust in Google, maybe you should pass on this one. </p>
<p> But in this day and age, when multi-billion companies are being devastated by cyber-attacks, can you even be so sure? </p>

<p> How to invert the navigation bar in Android 9 Pie </p>
<p> Android 9 Pie introduced a new navigation system called Gestures. This approach radically changes the way the navigation bar functions by cutting the Overview button and introducing the Pill. </p>
<p> When Gestures are enabled, the navigation bar only shows two buttons; the Back button, and the Pill. The Pill is used for performing all sorts of actions, like swiping through the apps, initiating Google Assistant, etc. While the Back button is still the back button, it takes you back to the previous window/app. </p>
<p> Now, combining gestures with buttons is a little bit controversial. Some people like the way new navigation works, some think it’s unnecessary complicated and that the bar takes too much space. </p>
<p> Regardless of what you think about Android Pie navigation, it’s a fact that the bar is not designed well for people with small hands. With the Back button on the left side, it’s kind of awkward for some people to reach it with their thumbs, especially on larger screens. </p>
<p> But that’s no reason to worry. Since we’re working with Android, almost anything you could think of is customizable, including the navigation bar. If the Back button is hard for you to reach, there’s an easy way to revert the navigation bar layout. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to System > Buttons. </p>
<p> Toggle the Invert layout option on. </p>
<p> Now the back button will be on the left side, far easier for you to reach it. Keep in mind that the layout inversion also works for the regular navigation bar. Only for this mode, it will swap the positions of the Back and Overview buttons. </p>
<p> Whether you like the new navigation system or not, it’s nice knowing that there’s at least some degree of customization available. That’s, of course, until Google releases Android Q, which will completely revamp the navigation system once again. </p>

<p> iOS 10.2.1 update fails to install, causes boot problems, and more </p>
<p> Apple has just released the new iOS 10.2.1 update for iPhone, iPad, and iPod. According to the release notes, the new patch is all about fixing existing bugs (that likely existed in the previous update), and improving the overall security in the system. </p>
<p> However, besides the new features and security patches, the new update brings something that users won’t be happy about. Namely, we’ve bumped into a few reports on Apple’s forums, about some issues that bother users who installed iOS 10.2.1. </p>
<p> So, we’ll let you know about these problems in this article, so you can know what to expect from the update, in case you haven’t installed it yet. </p>
<p> iOS 10.2.1 reported issues </p>
<p> Let’s start from the beginning. One user complained on the forums that he’s unable to finish downloading the update. According to him, the downloading process stops at 11 minutes remaining, without any further progress: </p>
<p> “Got my iphone6 from my brother, its IOS is still 8.1, i’m having a hard time updating the ios since the update avilable is 10.2.1.. i know it will take longer time to update but its almost 2days and still unable to successfully install it, any suggestions on how the update will push through? It’s been like that for 24hours though the time remaining is 11minutes.. “ </p>
<p> Another user from the forum suggested that updating the system via iOS will solve the problem. We haven’t tested this method yet, but if you’re experiencing update problems, you can give it a try. Or you can try with some of our solutions for iOS 10.2 updating problems. </p>
<p> It looks like people who managed to install the update have their fair share of problems, as well. Another user reported that he’s unable to booth his iPhone 7 after installing iOS 10.2.1: </p>
<p> “The actual update 10.2.1 killed my iPhone 7. The device will not boot direct after update. Has anyone the same problem? Is this a known behaviour / bug?” </p>
<p> However, this problem can be solved by pressing the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons, that resets the phone. Additionally, you can look for more solutions on Apple’s support pages. </p>
<p> Another user reported on the forums that he’s unable to send any emails from his iPhone 6 and iPad Air 2 after installing the update: </p>
<p> “I updated my iPhone 6 and iPad Air 2 to iOS 10.2.1 yesterday night. While I can receive email on my various pop3 accounts (att.net & godaddy hosted accounts), I cannot send anything. I keep getting error messages to have me check my SMTP settings (att.net serve) — which are unchanged from before last night, when it was working fine. Please help!” </p>
<p> One user suggested that re-adding the account in Settings resolves the problem. However, the forum thread has no other replies, so we can’t confirm if this is true. </p>
<p> In addition to these ‘fresh’ problems, users also report that some of the previously present problems still occur, even after installing the new update. The list of problems includes: WiFi connectivity issues, Bluetooth connection problems, strange battery drains, and more. So, it appears that the new update didn’t solve all the problems for all users. </p>
<p> Maybe apple should do the similar thing as Microsoft when announcing new Preview builds for Windows 10, and start adding “Known issues” to updates’ release notes. In order to give people a better insight into what a new update might break. </p>
<p> In case you’ve experienced some other problem that we didn’t list in this article, feel free to let us know in the comments below. </p>

<p> iOS 10.2 update issues roundup: Installation fails, battery drainage, and more </p>
<p> iOS 10.2 update is available for users worldwide. Apple decided to pass through a few beta stages and the final product is finally out. Last available update was iOS 10.1.1 that only fixed a few issues. </p>
<p> The main idea was to fix some known bugs and crashes, but at the same time, implement some interesting novelties. One that deserves mentioning above others is TV app (available only in the US) that will provide a better experience, along with tracking favorite shows and films. Also, we have some interesting cosmetic upgrades and witty implemented shortcuts. </p>
<p> While there are many bug fixes concerning apps and overall system stability and performance, some issues reached to our attention. We wandered through iOS forums and found some problems that we’ll report about. So, check out the most repetitive problems that are bothering users who installed iOS 10.2. </p>
<p> iOS 10.2 Reported Issues </p>
<p> A problem with most occurrences reported by iOS users is, as expected, the installation problem. Some users have the information that update is available. but they can’t start the installation. Meanwhile, others are informed by the system that software is up to date. The solution for this problem is not available at the moment. But, we advise you to try a soft reset, and see if that helps. </p>
<p> Next reported issue refers to battery drainage. A user from Apple Discussion Forum is complaining about fast battery drainage while Auto-brightness is ON. </p>
<p> ”Since updated to ios 10.2, battery is draining very fast. Auto-Brightness is on, but while using the phone in outdoor when brightness is full, battery went down from 53% to 42% in just 3 minutes.” </p>
<p> Another user objected that his battery drained in no time since updated to iOS 10.2. </p>
<p> ”I installed IOS 10.2 on 12/12/16. Phone was 100% charged at 7:00 pm; at 4:00 am on 12/13/16 the battery was completely discharged. </p>
<p> What changed in IOS 10.2 to affect battery usage like this?” </p>
<p> There may be a solution to the second problem. It appears that Battery Percentage is malfunctioning so ‘disable-restart phone-enable’ may work that out. </p>
<p> Next problem on the list is about the WhatsApp app that is incomplete after the iOS 10.2 update: </p>
<p> ”I have update my phone 26th September to new IOS 10.0.2 and my whattsapp tones are stuck on tri tone?? No matter what I do it wont change to what I want? Why is this? I assume a glitch in the new IOS version? Will this be fixed?” </p>
<p> In the given thread there is the solution for the problem. Just close the app, and restart your device. This will probably be of use for other”buggy” apps, as well. </p>
<p> One user complains that his photos were deleted from the album after the update. However, we’re are not sure if the problem is somehow connected with the update, since it isn’t acknowledged as a repetitive problem. </p>
<p> The last problem that got our attention is related to verification codes. One user reported about many verification codes that are not accepted. This prevented him/her from downloading and installing any apps to the device. </p>
<p> “I have updated my iPod Touch 6G to iOS 10.2 and There are 2 problems with it. The first is that Apple sent me ton of verification codes and they won’t accept any of them. Is there a way to disable them completely? Secondly, every time I try to install an app on the App Store, none of them will install at all. Can I fix this, or is it a really bad bug?” </p>
<p> Luckily, the good folks of the community posted a solution. We are giving it here in full: </p>
<p> Create new security questions and verify your date of birth’ </p>
<p> That’s about it for the problems reported so far. We hope this article gave you enough information about the newest updates issues. If you are having some other problems or a possible solution for the presented, please be sure to write it down in the comments section. </p>

<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues: Battery drain, sound issues, and more </p>
<p> Apple has released the seventh official update for iOS 11, iOS 11.1.2 to fix the known issue with the unresponsive screen and distortion in Live Photos and videos captured on the iPhone X. </p>
<p> However, even though iOS 11.1.2 fixes some issues, it actually causes some more, maybe even bigger, problems. Also, the update is mainly aimed at the iPhone X users. So, if we take into account that other devices barely receive anything but possible issues, it’s actually a clever idea to pass this update if you own any other device than the X. </p>
<p> Some users already backed up this claim, by reporting various issues that emerged after installing iOS 11.1.2. And guess what? Issues were reported mainly by users of older iPhones. </p>
<p> iOS 11.1.2 reported issues </p>
<p> Here’s what’s been bugging iPhone users who installed iOS 11.1.2: </p>
<p> iPhone X not receiving the update </p>
<p> We’ll actually start with issues on the iPhone X. While there are no bigger problems reported, some users recently complained they’re unable to obtain the update. </p>
<p> “My iPhone X not receiving iOS 11.1.2 software update, why?” </p>
<p> There’s no confirmed solution for this issue. However, I can recommend some general solutions, like making sure your phone is properly connected to the internet, checking your battery and storage. </p>
<p> Notes not opening on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> There are also some reports that users are unable to open Notes after installing iOS 11.1.2. </p>
<p> “My wife and I both have an iPhone 6. I wasn’t able to open Notes on iOS 11.1.1 tonight and luckily 11.1.2 fixed that for me since it was crashing as soon as I tried to open it. Her phone however just crashes the Notes app each time it is opened. She has plenty of free space in memory and the only other difference is she has an aftermarket screen. Both were purchased new from Apple when they debuted. She has notes she cannot lose and I need to get this resolved ASAP.” </p>
<p> As you can see, the situation is different from phone to phone. And it doesn’t necessarily mean this issue was caused by the most recent update. </p>
<p> So, this problem remains a mystery, as nobody has found a solution yet. </p>
<p> Voicemail not working </p>
<p> The Visual Voicemail issue is a widely known problem in iOS 11. And it seems people are still dealing with it in iOS 11.1.2. As one user reports: </p>
<p> “I downloaded the latest ios 11.1.2 and now when I push voicemail icon no messages show. There is a “call voice message” box.” </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Users also reported several sound and speaker problems in iOS 11.1.2. Here’s what some of them said: </p>
<p> “Does anyone have a clue how to recover sounds after the 11.1.2 OS upgrade?” </p>
<p> “When I watch videos my speakers do annoying sounds after I’ve updated iOS to 11.1.2” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, Apple Tech Support has remained silent. So, the exact solution for any of these problems remains to be found. </p>
<p> Battery drain </p>
<p> And finally, another widespread problem. You’ve probably already heard that the battery drain is an ongoing problem in iOS 11. And iOS 11.1.2 is not an exception. </p>
<p> “I am currently using my iPhone 6s Plus, running the latest software iOS 11.1.2, which was basically a fix for the iPhone X. I have no idea what is happening, but my battery dropped 40% in 11 hours while on idle. This happened as I unlocked my phone and started using it. This happened after I updated to iOS 11.1.2, and I not having this problem on iOS 11.1.1. I believe there is a huge bug in the software.” </p>
<p> The cause of this issue is most likely the YouTube app for iOS. Developers have already confirmed that the latest version of their app causes battery drains in iOS. </p>
<p> So, I recommend using a third-party YouTube client until the issue gets resolved. </p>
<p> As you can see, iOS 11.1.2 is far more troublesome than such a minor update should be. So, don’t be surprised if Apple releases another patch for iOS 11 soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.1.2 on your device? Are there any problems I didn’t cover here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
<p> DON’T USE WAZE unless you can charge your phone while driving. My phone went from 100% to 2% on a 1 hour drive this morning. (I needed it due to the traffic, but I needed my phone after.) </p>

<p> iPhone 6 and iPhone 5S have serious battery drainage while using Whatsapp, Facebook or Instagram (even when they are not being used but not closed). Before the update, those apps would use about half as much battery as they do now. Both phones get hot rapidly and my wife and I have to charge our phones at least twice a day with the same usage than before the update. </p>

<p> iOS 11.2 reported issues: No Apple Pay Cash, keyboard bugs, and more </p>
<p> Apple released iOS 11.2 earlier than planned to address various issues that hit iPhone users by storm this weekend. The new update deals with continuous crashes that users recently complained about on the forums. </p>
<p> But besides dealing with the crashing issue, iOS 11.2 also brought Apple Pay Cash, and some issues of ITS OWN! So, even though update patched some holes, it created cracks in new places. And that’s definitely not something users are looking for after a troublesome iOS 11.1.2 update. </p>
<p> So, let’s see what users have to say about iOS 11.2 update. </p>
<p> iOS 11.2 reported problems </p>
<p> No battery timers </p>
<p> One user reported that there are no battery timers after he installed the update: </p>
<p> “After update to iOS 11.2, battery timers since last full charge are empty. Reboot doesn’t help.” </p>
<p> However, this is not a real issue at all. It takes up to 24 hours for battery timers to appear after you update your iPhone. So, the only solution for this ‘problem’ is just waiting. </p>
<p> This ‘issue’ probably shouldn’t be on the list, but I decided to put it as some kind of additional info, in case you’re wondering why are battery timers missing. </p>
<p> Now, let’s move to some actual problems. </p>
<p> Keyboard bugs </p>
<p> One user reported strange keyboard bugs on his iPad Pro after installing iOS 11.2. Here the screenshots he posted on the forum: </p>
<p> Unfortunately, nobody had a solution for the keyboard problem on the forums, so it still remains to be seen what can be done to deal with this strange issue. </p>
<p> iPhone hangs on boot </p>
<p> A few users also reported their iPhones are unable to boot after the upgrade, as they’re stuck in the infinite loop of running circles: </p>
<p> “A friend of mine posted on Facebook saying that his iPhone kept showing the running circle after he had upgraded it to IOS 11.2. Anyone can suggest solution for it?” </p>
<p> One of the forum members sugestted doing a hard reset. However, nobody has confirmed if this solution is helpful, yet. </p>
<p> No Apple Pay Cash </p>
<p> Apple Pay Cash is a signature feature of iOS 11.2. However, numerous users say they haven’t got this feature yet. </p>
<p> At the time of writing this article, we still don’t know what’s the problem, and why users are unable to find Apple Pay Cash, even on supported devices. So, any additional info will be appreciated. </p>
<p> Ringtone issues </p>
<p> Another reported issue is a problem with ringtone sound in iOS 11.2. Here’s what one user said on the forums: </p>
<p> “I’m using iPhone 7plus ,I have updated iOS 11.2 and sometimes my phone not ringing sound is not works manytimes I miss my calls even message sounds also not working. I checked all the ways can’t resolve I keep ringing volumes full only and not in silent mode too. Please give ur opinion.” </p>
<p> Unfortunately, nobody had a valid solution for this problem. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> That’s about it. One thing’s for sure, these are not the only issues bugging iPhone users who recently installed iOS 11.2. These are just some issues I think are the most frequent and interesting. </p>
<p> Once again, judging by the amount of complaints on the forums, it looks like Apple failed to deliver a quality update once again. So, we should expect another update very soon. </p>
<p> Have you already installed iOS 11.2? Are there any issues I didn’t mention here? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> How to use new iOS 11 photo and video formats on other devices </p>
<p> Apple announced iOS 11 as a breakthrough in many categories. Interface changes, plenty of new functions, revamped Siri, Apple Pay, and, probably the most distinctive innovation: new formats of photo and video files. Now, users that have already tried beta version are mostly satisfied with changes. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, even though it’s not advised to install Beta version on your primary device, users that give it a shot reported quite satisfying performance. It’s just Beta, so don’t be sore if it’s glitchy or the representation of changes is not at a top level. However, one thing that won’t change on the full version we’re expecting in fall of 2017 is a new media file format. </p>
<p> New iOS 11 formats and how to use them on other devices </p>
<p> With the iOS 11, photos or videos you take with your iPhone or iPad will be stored in special, exclusive (Apple and exclusivity are apparently synonyms) formats. Photos drop JPG format and switch it for High-Efficiency Image Format (HEIF, the extension is .heic) and videos drop good old H.264 format and now are recorded in High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) with H.265 extension. </p>
<p> Now, these are the lossless formats so, basically, photos and videos will retain quality but will substantially drop in size. Almost half the size, to be exact. </p>
<p> Sadly, it besides all the advantages, this change also has an emerging problem to be answered. How to use this formats on other non-Apple devices? Well, for the time being, that’s not possible. At least until the rest of the tech world adopts to this changes. However, the files can be automatically transferred to iCloud or synced to other Apple device in JPG or H.264 formats if you choose to do so. </p>
<p> What you need to do is just follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Open Camera. </p>
<p> Choose Formats. </p>
<p> Set the second option to Automatic or JPG. </p>
<p> With that, you every new media file you shot or record will be transferred in widely-used formats. Albeit, if you already have photos taken and stored in the .heic format, keep them that way until some third-party converting solution emerges. </p>
<p> We hope this was helpful. Have in mind that this might become a generally accepted standard, as the time pass. With this change you’re now able to store around 100,000 photos on the 128GB device, which is an exceptional advancement, to say the least. </p>

<p> Fix: Battery drains after installing iOS 12 </p>
<p> The iOS 12 update is one of those updates which don’t get lots of visual or feature improvements. But, it brings a better notification grouping and, more importantly, great performance improvements for a whole family of devices. Initially, there’s gonna be some users which experience certain issues, like the battery drains some user noticed after the update. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Wait for a couple of days until the update sets in </p>
<p> After every major iOS update, the problems occur for some users. The nature of update distribution in the iOS ecosystem makes it subjective to issues. And it’s hard to say that modus operandi is bad, as the fragmentation is almost non-existent for Apple. A single update covers lots of devices under the same umbrella so it’s not unusual. </p>
<p> Even though a large majority of users found iOS 12 to be a great improvement for their handset, some had issues with battery drainage, even when a device (iPhone or iPad) is idle. </p>
<p> But we’re sure that this undesired occurrence won’t last for long. If you’re OK with waiting a bit, the irrational battery depletion should be resolved. The feedback is always helpful, and we’re sure that software developers at Apple are working towards optimization for all updated devices. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you’re in a hurry, we suggest reinstalling the update. But, this time, you should do it cleanly. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clean install the update </p>
<p> The suggested procedure when updating any smartphone or tablet (both iOS and Android) to a major update. Old files stored in the device make the optimization harder which is a good reason to update to iOS 12 on a device which is a clean slate. Developers can’t possibly optimize millions of individual devices as an end-user tends to personalize the device to his/her needs. </p>
<p> Don’t worry, though. You’ll get to restore all your data from the iCloud or the iTunes client later on. The procedure is rather simple and it won’t take too much of your time. </p>
<p> Here’s how to install iOS 12 clean on your iPhone/iPad: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Remember to backup your iPhone data. </p>
<p> Skip restoring the backup and update to iOS 12. </p>
<p> With that, we can conclude this article. Hopefully, it helped you address the battery drain issue so you can enjoy nice performance boost iOS 12 brought to the table. Also, don’t forget to present us your 2 cents in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/ios-13-3-problems" parent_folder="web1" id="file17841945" filename="ios-13-3-problems">
<p> On the other hand, while fixing certain bugs users had to deal with in the previous versions, the new update also causes a new set of issues that will make (some) users suffer even more. </p>
<p> To be fair, the list of problems isn’t too long. At least for the problems caused specifically by iOS 13.3. On top of that, there are also existing problems that Apple didn’t fix with this release. </p>
<p> You can, of course, analyze the situation, and decide if any of the listed flaws are potential dealbreakers. </p>
<p> Let’s break it down. </p>
<p> Parental control bugs </p>
<p> The only widespread bug that appears to be caused by the 13.3 update, per CNBC, is a flaw that allows children to easily bypass the Screen Time parental controls. So, the very highlight feature of this update is also its biggest problem. </p>
<p> Apparently, the flaw allows children to save, text or call any unknown number. Ideally, this shouldn’t be possible, because parents would have to enter a PIN before a child could do anything with an unknown number. </p>
<p> If you’re not using the parental control features, you shouldn’t experience any other issues, so this particular problem doesn’t apply to you. However, there are some individual reports on Apple support forums and social media that suggest iOS 13.3 could come with a few more flaws. </p>
<p> As these are individual cases, it doesn’t necessarily mean other users will encounter them, but I’ll list the problems here just in case. </p>
<p> Problems with notifications </p>
<p> Some users also report that they’re not receiving notifications from apps upon installing the iOS 13.3 update. – (source) </p>
<p> The only solutions I managed to find for this particular problem are some generic workarounds, like checking the notification settings, or force-quitting the app. However, these “resolutions” seem to be of little help. </p>
<p> Mobile Data problems </p>
<p> Problems with mobile data that some users have experienced in the past seem to still be present, even after installing this update. </p>
<p> Since yesterday morning, my iPhone 7 Plus’ internet connection is broken. I can still receive notifications but when i open the app it says that I do not have an internet connection. This is happening on all apps on either mobile data or Wi-Fi. Running iOS 13.3. </p>
<p> Reportedly, resetting the network settings seems to be helpful for some users, so you can try that, as well. To reset the network settings on your iPhone or iPad, go to Settings > General > Reset. </p>
<p> Battery Life </p>
<p> Users have battled with bad battery life ever since the release of iOS 13. And, although there appear to be fewer reports on battery drains after iOS 13.3, some users are still experiencing the problem. </p>
<p> “Just updated my iPhone 7 to ios 13.3. Battery life still the same as before. Guess this is how we’re gonna live our life now” </p>
<p> Right now, there isn’t a universal solution for the battery problem. We can only hope Apple will come up with an under-the-hood workaround, and release it to the public with some future iOS update. </p>

<p> iOS 13.5.1 issues: Battery drain, Bluetooth problems, and more </p>
<p> Apple recently released the latest iOS 13.5.1 update. The update is available to users of all compatible iPhone Models. Unlike the previous update, this one doesn’t bring any new features but instead focuses on improving the overall security of the OS. </p>
<p> Although Apple’s update release notes aren’t very clear on what exactly the new update does, it does state that the update addresses the vulnerability exploited by the uncover jailbreak. With that being said, most jailbreakers would want to avoid this update. The rest of the users can comfortably install this release, and they won’t notice any difference in the way their iPhone works. </p>
<p> Or will they? </p>
<p> Although the new update brings zero new features, it actually causes some problems to users who installed it. Users are reporting battery drains, Bluetooth issues, connectivity problems, and more. </p>
<p> However, none of the problems seems to be widespread, as these are the individually reported cases. You have better chances of installing the update without any problems, than being stuck with an annoying issue. Nevertheless, I’m going to list some of the reported problems here, so you can see what could potentially go wrong. </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 battery drain </p>
<p> Reports about the battery drain caused by iOS 13.5.1 have been circulating on Twitter since the update’s release. Here’s one of the complaints: </p>
<p> @AppleSupport iphone battery draining like crazy after upgrading to iOS 13.5.1. What’s going on? Is there a fix?? </p>
<p> Right now, the solution to this problem is unknown. It appears that users experiencing the battery drain issue will have to wait for Apple to release a follow-up update. </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> Although reported by the smaller number of users, it appears that Bluetooth also doesn’t work for some people who installed iOS 13.5.1. </p>
<p> @Apple my phones Bluetooth just won’t connect to any device even though it’s turned on and discoverable? Any ideas </p>
<p> iOS 13.5.1 Face ID issues </p>
<p> Although iOS 13.5 improved Face ID to make it work with face masks, some people apparently have problems with it stretching to iOS 13.5.1. </p>
<p> @AppleSupport Why my face id isn’t working? I just updated to ios 13.5.1 and now it’s keep telling me that face id is not available! Can you help me? </p>
<p> Other problems </p>
<p> Besides the above-mentioned issues that appear to be more common, there are also a few more problems, including a camera problem, weird charging (though this one wasn’t specified, so I can’t tell you whether it was indeed caused by iOS 13.5.1, and a SIM card issue where the phone shows SIM cards as invalid. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, there are no confirmed solutions to any of these problems. Apple support usually recommends generic solutions to particular problems, by I doubt any of those will be helpful. Users that were hit by the update will probably have to wait for a patch. </p>

<p> My face id stopped working on my Iphone X after 13.5.1. Always tells me to raise the iphone, lower the iphone, and ends up not being able to be set up. Had other people also try it on my phone to make sure it wasn’t related to my face – I have a beard. Didn’t work for my other test person either. Super irritating – didn’t realize how much I relied on it. I’ve searched everywhere and can’t find a solution that fixes it. I check multiple times a day for the next update. </p>

<p> iOS 13.6 issues: Face ID problems, possible battery drains </p>
<p> Apple just released iOS 13.6 for all eligible devices. Unlike previous minor updates, this one actually introduces a few new features, along with fixes for some of the known problems reported in the previous iOS versions. </p>
<p> The highlight of the new iOS version is the introduction of Digital Car keys. This feature allows you to use your iPhone to unlock your car. It’s currently only compatible with the newest BMW models, with more options coming soon. </p>
<p> There’s also a revamped version of Apple News+ that introduces Audio Stories, along with some other improvements to the app. You can read the full iOS 13.6 changelog here. </p>
<p> But how does iOS 13.6 perform in terms of stability? The good news is that, unlike iOS 13.5.1, the new iOS release doesn’t cause too many problems for the users. At least for now. Although the new update is still young, and potential complaints are yet to be reported, I’m optimistic iOS 13.5.1 won’t be as troublesome. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, I’m going to tell you about a few problems that I managed to dig up. Now, you should keep in mind that these are individual cases, which means you may never encounter any of these problems on your iPhone. </p>
<p> iOS 13.6 connectivity issues </p>
<p> Connectivity seems to be the biggest and the most widespread problem for users on iOS 13.6 so far. While some users are reporting the problems with WiFi, others are complaining about mobile data issues. </p>
<p> “Good day. After installing iOS 13.6 my phone at times go offline ‘No Service’. I have to reboot my phone always.” </p>
<p> There aren’t any known solutions for the connectivity issues on iOS 13.6 right now. And I don’t think anyone will address this problem until more people report it. But let’s just hope you won’t encounter it in the first place. </p>
<p> iOS 13.6 Face ID issues </p>
<p> A few users also said on Twitter that they’re either having problems with Face ID on this update, or that the problem started with the previous update, but Apple still hasn’t addressed it. I personally noticed I couldn’t unlock my iPhone 11 with the face mask on, which is a bit strange since Apple redesigned Face ID to work with face masks two iOS versions ago. </p>

<p> iOS 13.6 battery drain? </p>
<p> This one’s a bit tricky. As a matter of fact, many users report that iOS 13.6 has resolved the annoying battery drain caused by Apple Music that used to be a big deal in the previous versions. </p>
<p> However, one user also reported that he experienced a battery drain upon installing iOS 13.6. Here’s what he says: </p>
<p> “I have an iPhone SE 2nd gen and I’ve been experiencing surprisingly hot temperatures and performance issues. I tested it in Geekbench a few days ago and got a CPU score of 1321 and today I got 789. I don’t know if this is because of the later iOS builds . However when using 13.5.1 I got great performance. And long battery life. </p>
<p> Could this be just my iPhone or are others experiencing this as well?” </p>
<p> At the time of writing this article, the cause of the battery drain issue is still unknown. Maybe if more users report the same problem, we’ll get a response from Apple. On the other hand, if no one else complains about it on iOS 13.6, this could end up being an isolated case that you shouldn’t have to worry about. </p>
<p> That’s about it. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t find too many reported issues. And even those listed above could easily be individual cases. That’s certainly a step in the right direction, especially if we take into account that users had way too many problems with some of the previous releases. </p>
<p> How’s iOS 13.6 working for you? Have you encountered any problems I didn’t list here? Make sure to let us know in the comments below. </p>

<p> I have been having FaceID problems on my iPhone X since the new update, and also the battery drains very fast. I reset my FaceID a few times and rebooting without improvement. Is there a solution to this problem? </p>

<p> Face ID no longer works for me after updating to iOS 13.6. Tried rebooting, resetting Face ID, and setting up alternative appearance. Nothing helped. </p>
<p> Same here, using Xs Max and the worse thing is they removed my comments from their forum where I asked them to check their firmware and own the issue and release a fix. I myself a software developer and realising now apple just a name now quality is going downhill. visited the apple store too and young lad told me that face id sensor and replacement phone cost me for a price of new. my mistake to leave android never again. </p>

<p> Very disappointed in this update. When I call various contacts, I am getting a message that this call cannot be completed as dialed. The number I am calling worked just fine 2 days ago. I have about 6 contacts who I can no longer call with my cell phone. Went to Verizon store to get assistance, he finally used his iphone to call the number and he got the same message. He thought it was from update also. I hope they get a fix for this. Ridiculous. </p>

<p> only thing I’ve noticed with 13.6 is that the only “recent calls” that show up are Face Time videos, of which I have few. </p>

<p> 13.6 is like everything else Apple does as soon as they start pushing to many updates I know I’m going to have a battery drain. After this I’m moving to another OS I have 1 POD 2 IPAD 2 IPHONES that are junk This is the last time I deal with Apple. I saw this coming again. </p>

<p> iOS 14.0.1 issues: Widgets don’t work, battery drains, and more </p>
<p> Apple recently released iOS 14.0.1, the first public update delivered after iOS 14. The new update arrived just eight days after the original major update. According to the release notes, the new update should fix some issues reported in the initial iOS 14 version and improve the overall security of the system. </p>
<p> Such a fast update is not a surprise and surely makes sense for Apple, as the company kind of rushed with releasing iOS 14. Not only that the new update caused all sorts of issues for users, but it also arrived just one day after its announcement, leaving developers with little to no time to prepare their apps, which have lead to even more problems. </p>
<p> Here’s the complete changelog of the iOS 14.0.1 update: </p>
<p> This update includes bug fixes for your ‌iPhone‌. – Fixes an issue that could cause default browser and mail settings to reset after restarting your ‌iPhone‌ – Addresses an issue that could prevent camera previews from displaying on ‌iPhone‌ 7 and ‌iPhone‌ 7 Plus – Fixes an issue that could prevent your ‌iPhone‌ from connecting to Wi-Fi networks – Resolves an issue that could prevent sending email with some mail providers – Addresses an issue that could prevent images from appearing in the News widget – For information on the security content of Apple software updates, please visit this website: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201222 </p>
<p> Even though the new update, on paper, deals with a lot of original issues, Apple Community forums are still flooded with complaints saying that many have persisted. There are even reports of new problems caused by the latest release. </p>
<p> I compiled a list of the most common problems caused by iOS 14.0.1. This should give you a better idea of what to expect from the update if you haven’t installed it yet. </p>
<p> iOS 14.0.1 won’t download </p>
<p> One of the main complaints about this update is that people are unable to download it. According to reports, the update either stops in the middle of downloading or doesn’t appear in the Settings app whatsoever. </p>
<p> I can’t think of any specific solution, except the generic ones. Make sure you have enough storage space for the update and make sure your phone has enough battery left. </p>
<p> Of course, you’ll only be able to install iOS 14.0.1 if you’re coming from iOS 14. So, if you’re running an older version of iOS on your iPhone, make sure to install iOS 14 first. </p>
<p> Problems with SMS and messages on iOS 14.0.1 </p>
<p> The refreshed and improved messaging app surely didn’t make a stellar debut for a handful of unlucky users. Namely, people have been reporting various issues with the Messages app on iOS 14.0.1. From disappearing messages to notifications that won’t go away. </p>
<p> This isn’t too big of a surprise, since Apple drastically revamped the app on iOS 14, so a few bugs or imperfections may have slipped through developers’ fingers. The only thing you can do if you’ve experienced any problem with Messages on iOS 14.0.1 is to wait for Apple to iron things out in future updates. Given the number of complaints, you probably won’t have to wait for too long for the fixing patch. </p>
<p> Hotspot not working on iOS 14.0.1 </p>
<p> Sharing your internet connection with another person can be a lifesaver. For them more than for you, but you still get the satisfaction of doing a good deed. Unfortunately, that’s impossible on some iPhones running iOS 14.0.1. </p>
<p> If you were unlucky enough, your iPhone’s hotspot feature might not be identifiable or it could be missing completely. Here’s what one user said on Apple Forums about this problem: </p>
<p> “Hi there, Can you use hotspot in iOS 14.0.1? other devices don’t identify my hotspot! If you know anything, it would be appreciated to let me know about it. And I have an iPhone 7 by the way.” </p>
<p> Similar hotspot issues were reported in previous iOS 14 betas, so we could say the problem just transferred to the stable version for some users. Although there’s no universal solution that deals with the issue, a few testers reported they managed to overcome it by changing the hotspot APN, so you could try the same thing. </p>
<p> Here’s how to rename your hotspot on iOS 14.0.1: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Cellular > Cellular Data Network. </p>
<p> Set the same APN for Hotspot as it is for Cellular data. </p>
<p> Widgets don’t work on iOS 14.0.1 </p>
<p> The minute Apple announced widgets on Home Screen, everyone knew that’s going to be a big thing. As it turns out, widgets on Home Screen are even bigger than anyone expected. The new customization option sparked a whole new culture of alternating Home Screens. Users are crazy about the new widgets to the point where it’s a legit competition of who’s going to be more creative in combining widgets with Shortcuts to get the most unique Home Screen experience. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, not every user can participate in this “competition”, as people have reported that widgets don’t work for them on iOS 14.0.1. Now, these reports aren’t very clear, so I can’t tell whether it’s third-party or stock widgets people complain about. But I have a feeling it’s mixed. </p>
<p> Anyway, if you’re having problems with a third-party widget, you should probably give some more time to developers to polish it. As a reminder, Apple kind of rushed with releasing iOS 14 last week, leaving many developers with unfinished products. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if a first-party widget won’t show, or you can’t resize it, or it bugs you in any other way, you’ll probably have to wait for Apple to release a fixing update. </p>
<p> iOS 14.0.1 drains the battery </p>
<p> Battery life problems mostly date back to the original iOS 14 release, and it seems that the problem just hasn’t been solved yet. In fact, forums and social media sites are flooded with reports of “worse battery life”. </p>
<p> Right now, there isn’t too much you can do to prevent the battery drain. You can try some general measures that should help you preserve the battery life (low power mode, adaptive brightness, etc.) until the patch arrives. On the other hand, a big number of complaints could prove to be positive, as it should force Apple to deliver a fix sooner. </p>
<p> This isn’t the whole list of issues reported on iOS 14.0.1. However, I feel most of the problems I didn’t mention here occurred in the initial version, so I decided to leave them out. Since the new iOS version appears to be troublesome, we’ll dedicate a few articles to individual problems (and try to solve them, if possible). </p>
<p> What’s your experience with iOS 14.0.1 and iOS 14 in general so far? Feel free to let us know about your problems in the comments down below. </p>

<p> Since the update I can only use WiFi. If I’m out and using mobile data all I get is buffering. Nothing loads or refreshes. Which made for an awkward moment when my bank app wouldn’t load and I had to go in to a bank and pay to have money transferred. So I could make a purchase. Olden days style. I’ve tried every troubleshooting, reset, restart options I can find short of a full factory reset. Everything that it supposed to be on, is. I have plenty of data available.

<p> I cannot get my emails AFTER the 14.0.1 update. It worked fine after the iOS 14 update but 14.0.1 has stopped emails from updating and I’ve checked and set all settings, rebooted, deleted email app and reinstalled and still NO emails!!! iPhone X . I NEED HELP NOW!!!! Also the text suggestions are slow loading and the earpiece volume is low. I’ve cleaned the earpiece screen and all volumes are turned to highest levels. I have to use speaker to have a phone conversation which is not always good. </p>

<p> iOS 14.2 issues: Face ID problems, battery drains, and more </p>
<p> Apple finally released iOS 14.2 to the public. This is the second major update to iOS 14 that was released in September. The new update combines a set of new features with aesthetic novelties to bring the biggest iOS 14 release so far. </p>
<p> The highlight of the new update is a brand new emoji set that introduces over 100 new emojis to the pack. There are also new wallpapers (I personally think these are the best wallpapers Apple has released in years), new Music widgets, a new Intercom feature, and more. All in all, there’s a lot to be excited about in the new update. </p>
<p> But what’s also traditionally true for most iOS updates, regardless of size and importance, is that not everyone is actually excited about them. That being people who encounter issues after updating their iPhones. </p>
<p> Although iOS 14.2 doesn’t appear to be as troublesome as some of the previous updates (so far), there’s still a handful of issues that bug users who were unfortunate enough to get them along with the new update. </p>
<p> I searched the forums for newly-reported problems, and here’s what I’ve found. </p>
<p> Unable to update to iOS 14.2 </p>
<p> There are a few threads on Apple Community forums (here’s one of them), that suggest some users are having a hard time getting the update. Whether the update fails to download, or doesn’t even appear in the Settings, the result is the same. Those affected can’t install iOS 14.2 at the moment. </p>
<p> Some contributors on Apple’s forums offer generic solutions, like checking the WiFi connection, storage, battery, etc. I couldn’t find any “unique” solutions, so you can either try one of the mentioned generic answers or just wait for something better to appear. </p>
<p> iOS 14.2 internet connection issues </p>
<p> A few users also seem to have a problem with connecting to the internet. For example, here’s one user complaining about being unable to connect to his WiFi network: </p>
<p> After the latest update I have an issue with the WiFi connection. I restarted the modem but it need to much time to find the WiFi every time I open the iPad . Anybody else face with this issue </p>
<p> It goes the other way, too, as one user says he’s only able to connect to the internet via WiFi, as his LTE connection doesn’t work after the update: </p>
<p> I am only able to access the internet on Wifi. LTE does not work despite having at least 2 bars. I have done a signal strengths field test and signals were in an acceptable range. My cellular data is set to LTE. I have reset my network connection. I upgraded to iOS 14.2 and restarted my phone. This seems to be a device or software issue. Help! </p>
<p> Battery drain on iOS 14.2 </p>
<p> I feel like every single iOS update causes the battery drain to someone. In fact, this is probably the biggest issue an average iOS user has with his/her iPhone. Given the number of complaints, it’s hard to know whether the problem was caused by a specific update, or it’s been there for a longer period of time. </p>
<p> Of course, iOS 14.2 is not an exception. That’s why I can’t tell for sure if the battery drain some users mention on the forums was caused by this release in particular or it dates back to previous iOS versions. I can act like my colleagues back at Apple support and give you a list of (mostly generic) solutions to the battery drain issue on iOS 14. Hopefully, that will be of some help. If not, you’ll probably have to be patient and wait for Apple to fix the issue in some of the future updates. </p>
<p> Face ID doesn’t work on iOS 14.2 </p>
<p> Here’s another one that isn’t exclusive to iOS 14.2, but still persists to this day. Users have been complaining about Face ID for months now, and Apple still doesn’t seem to have figured everything out. Especially in these odd times when our appearance is altered with face masks. There’ve been attempts to make Face ID more compatible with face masks, but with mixed results. </p>
<p> For those of you who have Face ID issues on iOS 14.2, I’m writing a dedicated article about the whole problem right now. I’ll update this piece as soon as that article is done, so maybe you’ll get something out of it. </p>
<p> As iOS 14.2 is still young (only two days old, at the time of writing), it’s possible more issues will surface in the coming days. I’ll stay on the lookout for the next week or so, and will update the list if any new problem appears. </p>
<p> In the meantime, you can tell us about your problems with iOS 14.2 in the comments below. </p>
<p> 2 COMMENTS </p>
<p> I updated yesterday, and now when I double-click the home button to thumb through all open tasks, most-to-all of them show as blank rectangles instead of the screen shots they used to show. This is sporadic. Previously, only the [Settings] task would show as a blank rectangle. Is this a bug, or intentionally designed behavior? </p>

<p> iOS 14 brings the Picture-in-Picture mode: But will it work with YouTube? </p>
<p> Apple announced the new software for the iPhones, iOS 14 during its annual WWDC conference on Monday. The updated iOS version will bring a plethora of new features, including redesigned widgets, improved Siri, an app drawer (lookalike), and more. The list of features promises that iOS 14 will be the most exciting iOS release in years. </p>
<p> One of the highlight features is definitely the long-awaited Picture-in-Picture mode. While iPad users got this feature years ago (and Android users even before them) the iPhone owners will have to wait until this fall to be able to minimize videos into a small window that runs over other apps. </p>
<p> As seen in the presentation, the Picture-in-Picture mode on iOS 14 functions as you would expect it. While in an app with video playback, just swipe up from the bottom of the phone to go to the home screen and a small window playing video will stay on. You can then move it around the screen, resize it, or close it. You can even pin it to a side of the screen if it gets in the way, and pull it back later to continue watching, which is definitely a nice touch. </p>
<p> Obviously, Apple used its AppleTV app to showcase the new Picture-in-Picture mode. And while it all seems to be working flawlessly with this first-party app, the question most people have still remained. Will the upcoming Picture-in-Picture mode work with YouTube’s iOS app? </p>
<p> Will iOS 14’s Picture-in-Picture mode work with YouTube? </p>
<p> To get straight to the point, I’m pessimistic YouTube for iOS will support the Picture-in-Picture mode. There are a few exhibits to back up this prediction. </p>
<p> First thing first, the YouTube app currently doesn’t support the Picture-in-Picture mode on iPadOS. Even with the Premium account, you’ll only get as far as playing audio in the background. </p>
<p> That’s solely Google’s choice. Since developers need to implement the Picture-in-Picture API provided by Apple, Google simply opted not to. </p>
<p> You have to understand that, as two of the most powerful companies in the world, Google and Apple are huge competitors. And while declaring war on one another will bring more harm than good in terms of profit, both sides are taking every chance they’ve got to trade blows. And usually, it’s the small details that tend to annoy users of the opposite platform. In this case, it’s the absence of the Picture-in-Picture support in the YouTube app for iOS. </p>
<p> You’ll probably still be able to use the Safari/Chrome “hack”to get YouTube to go into the Picture-in-Picture mode, but this method is quite inconvenient, and I doubt many people will do it regularly. </p>
<p> We’ll have to wait until Apple releases iOS 14 and answers this question for us. Who knows, maybe Google will change its current stance. But, the way things are looking now, it probably won’t, at least for the foreseeable future. </p>

<p> How to be sure no one is reading your private messages in iOS </p>
<p> Age of digital social interactions is at its peak. And the largest part in that interaction is reserved to smartphones we use to communicate with our friends, colleagues, and family. It’s fast, it’s cheap and it’s easy. However, one segment of our daily dose of digital social interactions that is endangered is most certainly the privacy. </p>
<p> We all heard of the latest privacy infringement with Wikileaks, CIA, and Apple involved, called Vault 7. To cut a long story short, Wikileaks got in touch with some top classified CIA documents with a detailed description of hacking procedures of various Apple’s devices. Apple later denounced those claims and stated that all mentioned security loopholes are fixed after 2013. Now, there’s only so much we can do to oppose CIA spooks, but we can at least preserve our privacy locally. </p>
<p> Namely, there are some features we need to check after the phone is acquired (a must for secondhand or refurbished) to make sure we (and recipients) are the only ones who can access our sensitive data. Moreover, there are additional security measures we need to take in order to protect our phone from an intrusion. So, for that purpose, we compiled a list of few simple steps you should follow to repel even the slightest suspicion. </p>
<p> How to protect your privacy with tools every iPhone have </p>
<p> Check iMessage </p>
<p> iMessage is probably the safest standard SMS client you can find on the smartphone market. When it comes to the privacy, Apple is light years in front of Google. But, there are a few things you should check. </p>
<p> Use secure Apple ID for iCloud backup of messages. </p>
<p> To make sure that you are running your messaging app with trusted Apple ID open Settings >Messages > Send & Recieve. </p>
<p> Remove unknown devices from Text Message Forwarding (Settings > Messages > Text Message Forwarding). You may need to change the Apple ID password in order to clear device list. </p>
<p> If you are more likely to use an alternative instant messenger, make sure you use the ones with the end-to-end encryption. </p>
<p> Make sure the device isn’t jailbroken </p>
<p> Advanced user can use jailbreak to enrich the experience and take a full control of customization. However, an uninformed newbie may have more than a few issues. The privacy infringement and data loss are included. </p>
<p> As you are probably aware, an app must pass strict Apple’s security and quality (to lesser extent) measures to become available on Apple Store and iTunes. However, it’s not the same with the jailbroken phones. Cydia is a 2-way street. You gain a lot of freedom but the privacy isn’t guaranteed. So, if you’re not sure about Cydia surroundings, don’t use it. </p>
<p> Moreover, if you have acquired the handset with Cydia installed and one (or more) untraceable apps are working in the background, perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Choose Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Erase all content and settings. </p>
<p> Start iTunes and choose Summary. </p>
<p> Select Restore. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and move on to restoring process. </p>
<p> Take a good care about your credentials </p>
<p> Your credentials are the key. Create strong Apple ID password and keep it to yourself. Also, it’s highly advised to enable two-factor authentication. That should provide you with additional security layer in case someone sneaky gets your Apple ID password. </p>
<p> Tap iCloud. </p>
<p> Open Apple ID. </p>
<p> Tap Password & Security. </p>
<p> Then you can enlist your trusted devices and phone numbers. Practically, you’ll be timely prompted if someone tries to access your Apple ID. </p>
<p> Moreover, if you are using iTunes for backups, make sure to enable Encryption that offers additional password. That way only you can access encrypted data. </p>
<p> Use only secure Wi-Fi networks </p>
<p> Another important thing you should remember is related to untrusted Wi-Fi sources. There is an abundance of ways your data can be stolen trough seemingly benevolent hotspots. Make sure to remember this next time you connect to an open network. </p>
<p> Don’t connect to suspicious networks without proper encryption. </p>
<p> Use VPN. There are a numerous VPN services but we ensure you that the StrongVPN offers amazing, military-graded security for an affordable price. Make sure to check it out. </p>
<p> Never give credentials like email or private information. </p>
<p> Wrap-up </p>
<p> When it comes to security and privacy, Apple stands firm above others. However, don’t let your guard down. The same way you don’t want someone sniffing around your house, you’ll hate to see someone reading your messages, tracking your location or checking your browser history. </p>
<p> And don’t forget to post your questions or suggestions in the comments section. We’ll appreciate it. </p>

<p> Fix: iPhone 6 camera freezes in iOS 10 </p>
<p> System upgrade to iOS 10 brought a lot of novelties for Apple consumers. It upgraded many features and improved the user experience. For all the supported devices. However, with upgrades, we also got an abundance of issues. </p>
<p> In particular, there are some issues that are device-specific. Namely, the ones that function well on iPhone 7 or 7+ are quite problematic for its predecessors. A lot of users reported camera freeze that is followed with a black screen. The problem showed after a system upgrade. We prepared some possible solutions for the issue. </p>
<p> How to fix camera app freeze on iPhone 6 and 6+ </p>
<p> Update your iPhone </p>
<p> Many of the users that previously reported this issue, managed to solve it after updating iOS. Apparently, Apple decided to address the problem and patched the Camera app. You can update your phone this way: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Choose Software Update. </p>
<p> Install the update. </p>
<p> Additionally, you may want to install the update via iTunes. To do so, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Download and install the latest version of iTunes or your PC. </p>
<p> Connect the iPhone to the PC via USB cable. </p>
<p> Click Summary. </p>
<p> Choose Check for update. </p>
<p> Click Download and Update. </p>
<p> Please, make sure that your connection is stable and the phone is fully charged. </p>
<p> Reset iPhone settings </p>
<p> Some common bugs are easily solved with settings reset. Because of that, it is reasonable to try it out with the camera issue, as well. In addition, you’ll only lose your preferences while the data will remain untouched. You can do that in these few simple steps: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Select General. </p>
<p> Choose Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset All Settings. </p>
<p> Please remember to write down all settings in order for you to retrieve them after the restart. </p>
<p> Restore your device to factory settings </p>
<p> By completely whipping your phone all the doubts of a culprit for this issue should be resolved. If this doesn’t help, the problem is probably hardware. So, you’ll need to look out for repair or replace your device. We advise you to backup your data to an iCloud before performing restore process. There are two basic ways to perform it. We will present you both. </p>
<p> To avoid possible issues, make sure your iPhone battery is full. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Choose General. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Select Erase All Content and Settings. </p>
<p> Have in mind that all of your data will be gone, so be sure to back it up before performing the reset. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and start the process. </p>
<p> Later on, you should choose Restore from the iCloud Backup feature, and retrieve your data. </p>
<p> The second way includes your PC and iTunes. When it comes to backing up your data, this is an arguably faster way. </p>
<p> Download and install the latest version of iTunes app on your PC. </p>
<p> Connect your device to a PC. </p>
<p> Start iTunes and choose Summary. </p>
<p> Remember to backup your iPhone data. </p>
<p> Select Restore iPhone. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and move on to restoring process. </p>
<p> These were our solutions. We hope you’ll manage to resolve your issues and use your camera without stutters and flickering. If you have any suggestion or alternative workaround, please share it with us in the comments section. </p>

<p> Fix: iPhone home button not working </p>
<p> iPhone is, besides its steady workflow and exclusive iOS features, known for sturdy and quality build. Even though hardware issues are less frequent than software issues, it’s still quite common for certain faulty series to emerge. </p>
<p> For example, the iPhone‘s Home button malfunction is one of the most common hardware issues related to iOS in general. Customers around the world had (or still have) issues with most used physical button on the device. Apple acknowledged the problem, but it’s still unclear how they have dealt with it. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we prepared some workarounds that might be helpful. If the Home Button on your iPhone is faulty, check the steps below. </p>
<p> How to fix iPhone Home Button not working </p>
<p> Restart your iPhone </p>
<p> Let’s be perfectly honest and say that this is a hardware problem in 90% of registered cases. Apple acknowledged that certain models, especially the iPhone 5, have had issues with the Home Button. For that purpose, it’s the safest route to take your device to repair service or to contact the Apple’s Center for repairs. </p>
<p> However, there are some things you can do on your own. The most obvious step you can take once the troubled button shows signs of malfunction is to restart your device. It can help you to resolve some software-inflicted issues, possibly caused by updates or misuse. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button. </p>
<p> After it appears, use the slider to turn your device Off. </p>
<p> After the device turns off, use Sleep/Wake button to turn it On again. </p>
<p> Clean button with cloth </p>
<p> Even though you might have the tools and the knowledge for the job, we still won’t advise you to mess around iPhone. You’ll most definitely lose warranty and in addition, you can make the things worst. On the other side, you can always use a slightly wet cloth to clean the button surroundings of debris and dirt that might’ve been causing the Home button malfunction. </p>
<p> In addition, make sure to remove the protective casing since it can also block the button and look for changes. </p>
<p> Use Assistive Touch to project on-screen Home Button </p>
<p> This isn’t the solution per se, but rather a tweak. Apple offers a handy feature for users that are either unable to reach certain buttons or the buttons won’t work, like in this case. So, basically, Assistive Touch mirrors physical buttons on your touchscreen. </p>
<p> You can enable it and use it as an alternative until you sort the things out. Follow the instructions below to enable Assistive Touch on your iPhone: </p>
<p> Open the Settings app. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Choose Accessibility. </p>
<p> Under the Interaction section, enable Assistive Touch. </p>
<p> Now you can choose the best-suited location on the screen for artificial Home Button. </p>
<p> Take your device to service </p>
<p> Finally, as we already stated, it’s hard to address on your own a problem which is hardware-related and even confirmed by Apple. For that purpose, we advise you to take your device for a repair. We’re talking about premium devices and your carrier or Apple itself is bonded to provide a premium service. </p>
<p> That’s it. If you have questions or suggestions regarding the subject, we’ll be glad to hear from you in the comments below. </p>

<p> iPhone keyboard click suddenly becomes loud? Here’s what to do </p>
<p> Apple is a kind of company that strives for perfection. That’s why it designed the iPhone, along with iOS as its heart and soul, to be nearly impeccable. But as appealing as the whole “perfection concept” sounds, it’s a Sisyphean task. As you know, nothing’s perfect, including the iPhone. Users still have to deal with those little annoyances that can casually spoil the whole experience. Of course, one of these bugs will make you jump out of the iPhone wagon, but still… </p>
<p> One of these inconsistencies I personally, and I assume you too, find annoying is when the default keyboard sound unexpectedly becomes louder. This happens all of the sudden and initially seems unprovoked. The louder click is especially frustrating whey you have your earphones on, and the unexpected boom blows your ears off. </p>
<p> When doing the research for this article, I noticed that the problem has been around for years. And apparently, it still bugs users to this day. In fact, this is the first problem, or irritant if you would, I noticed when I switched from Android to iOS. </p>
<p> So, what’s it all about? Why does the keyboard click unpredictably go loud sometimes? Well as it appears, that happens because of the way your iOS works. Namely, when you receive a notification, your phone will turn the volume up by a bar to improve the chances of you hearing the incoming notification. But if you happen to be typing on your keyboard at the same time you receive the notification, the keyboard click will go louder, as well. </p>
<p> So, is there a solution? Apparently not. As I mentioned, this problem’s been around for years, and Apple still hasn’t done anything about it. Maybe we’ll eventually get a fix in the future, but judging on how much time has passed since this was originally reported, I’m not very optimistic. </p>
<p> Switch to haptics </p>
<p> That’s right, there’s no way deal with this, so if you want your keyboard to keep clicking, you’ll just have to live with it. But here’s the thing, you don’t have to. I recommend completely turning off the keyboard sound and switching to haptics instead. </p>
<p> Not only that you won’t develop a fear of incoming notifications, but it will also feel nice to your fingers. At least that’s how I like my keyboard. </p>
<p> In case you don’t know how to switch your iPhone keyboard to haptics, just follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Sounds & Haptics. </p>
<p> Scroll down and toggle the Keyboard Clicks option off. </p>
<p> Make sure System Haptics is enabled. </p>
<p> That’s about it, the keyboard clicks are now off. From now on, the only thing you’ll feel is a gentle vibration. </p>
<p> What’s not so practical, though, is that there’s no option to enable or disable haptics for the keyboard alone. So, if you don’t want haptics whatsoever, you’ll have to disable them system-wide, and vice versa. </p>
<p> That concludes this article. I know this is no good news for users who prefer keyboard clicks, but unfortunately, there’s nothing you can do about it. </p>
<p> How do you prefer to use your keyboard? Is it with clicks? Or haptics? Or completely silent? Let us know in the comments below. </p>
<p> 1 COMMENT </p>
<p> Cool story bro except my typing sound periodically rises and falls its very odd, even when I am not receiving notifications if I spam one key or a bunch of random ones every few second there will be one extremely loud text sound and then it goes quiet again for a few seconds. F*** Apple </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/iphone-not-backing-up-icloud" parent_folder="web1" id="file17841373" filename="iphone-not-backing-up-icloud">
<p> Fix: iPhone not backing up to iCloud </p>
<p> iCloud is an incremental part of the ecosystem for every iPhone user. It provides that much-needed sense of security by safely backing up your stuff, so you don’t have to worry even if it comes to worst. </p>
<p> But what if your iPhone stops backing up your files, photos, notes, contacts, and everything else to iCloud? Well, you’ll want to deal with that problem as soon as possible. You never know when you’re going to need a ready backup. </p>
<p> So, if you got up on a wrong foot today, and your iPhone stopped backing up your data to iCloud, I’ll try to resolve the problem with this article. Stay tuned. </p>
<p> Check the storage </p>
<p> One of the main reasons the iPhone won’t sync to iCloud is insufficient storage. You can’t put more staff in your iCloud if there’s simply no room for it. In case the lack of storage is indeed the cause of your problem, you’ll probably get the message saying “Not enough storage”. </p>
<p> If you indeed received this message, you already know what to do. Either free up some storage or expand iCloud capacity. Now, if you’re not sure how to do that, don’t worry. I got you covered. </p>
<p> Bonus: Manage your iCloud storage </p>
<p> As I said, if you don’t have enough space in your iCloud account for fresh backups, you have two options. You either buy additional space or you free up the existing storage. </p>
<p> Now, I know you’d rather not pay for the expansion, but the initial 5GB you get for free won’t get you too far. As a matter of fact, I filled the original 5GB plan after just a few days after getting my iPhone, with pictures taking the most of it. </p>
<p> Apple offers iCloud storage plans that are billed monthly. The bad news is that it’s not a one-time purchase, but it’s not too expensive either, depending on your location and a monthly plan you choose. </p>
<p> For example, if you live in the US, an additional 50GB/200GB/2TB of storage space will set you back $0.99/$2.99/$9.99 per month respectively. If you live outside the United States, your price may vary. Check out Apple’s support page to see how much iCloud storage costs in your country. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you don’t want to pay for additional storage, you’ll have to make the most out of what you’ve already got. That means, go to the iCloud storage management section and delete some existing backups or disable further sync for some of the apps that take too much space. </p>
<p> To manage your iCloud storage, go to Settings > tap your name > iCloud. Here you can choose which apps are backing up their data to iCloud, and you can easily disable backup for each app. </p>
<p> To see existing backups, tap Manage storage. Just go through the list of apps, and hopefully, you’ll find a backup that you don’t really need, but takes too much space. For example, while writing this article, I noticed that the Lightroom backup takes like 2GB of storage, which is something I had to deal with. </p>
<p> Photos are perhaps the biggest “eater” of storage, and deleting them would certainly free up a huge chunk of space. However, you probably don’t want to do that and leave your precious photos unprotected. If this dilemma bothers you, and you still don’t want to pay for additional storage space, I suggest turning to Google Photos. In fact, many people prefer Google Photos over iCloud, because the app and service are more convenient. And it’s free. </p>
<p> Make sure you’re connected to WiFi </p>
<p> Although this one looks obvious, you’d be surprised if I tell you how many times have my iPhone disconnected from my home WiFi network, and either switched to data or my neighbor’s WiFi. The same thing can happen to you. </p>
<p> So, before taking some more serious steps, just make sure you’re properly connected to WiFi. I should also point out that your phone only backs up your files while you’re connected to WiFi, it won’t do anything on mobile data. And that’s a good thing. Trust me, you don’t want to use mobile data for backing up, because you’ll lose it in a matter of minutes. </p>
<p> Disable Low Power Mode </p>
<p> My educated guess is that the Low Power Mode is exactly the cause of your problem. So, I’m confident you’ll solve your problem after dealing with the Lowe Power Mode. </p>
<p> In case you don’t know what this feature does, it puts your phone in a state where it uses less power to preserve the battery (hence the name). When your phone uses less power, it can’t perform some of the more power-consuming operations, with backing up being one of them. </p>
<p> The Low Power Mode usually activates when your battery percentage is below 20%. All you need to do in this case is to simply charge your phone. It will disable the Low Power Mode and the backup process will continue as usual. </p>
<p> But if you don’t want to wait for your phone to fully charge, you can also disable this feature manually. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Battery, and disable Low Power Mode. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if I was wrong, and your iPhone still won’t back up to iCloud, well, I guess you should try another solution. </p>
<p> Make sure backups are enabled </p>
<p> So far, we’ve been talking about backups in general. But if a certain app won’t back up to iCloud, while others are working fine, you should go and see what’s wrong with that particular app. </p>
<p> Since I can’t predict which app won’t back up for you, I can’t lay down all of the possible solutions for your problem. However, I can tell you where to start. And that’s making sure backup is enabled for that specific app in the first place. </p>
<p> Anyway, here’s how to manage individual app backups on your iPhone: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap your name, and head over to iCloud. </p>
<p> Here you’ll find a list of apps that are compatible with backing up to iCloud. Scroll down and just make sure the app you’re looking for is enabled. </p>
<p> Check the iCloud service status </p>
<p> Maybe the problem isn’t coming from your side. There’s a chance you’re unlucky today and that Apple’s servers that handle iCloud are temporarily down. It’s a real thing that could easily happen, believe me. </p>
<p> So, just in case, head over to Apple’s website and check if the servers are online. You can check the server status of iCloud, along with all other Apple services, here. </p>
<p> If the server’s indeed down, you shouldn’t worry too much. It will probably stay down for a brief period only, as Apple probably has the best infrastructure in the world. Once the servers go back online, you’ll be able to normally back up your files to your iCloud account. Of course, if there are no other problems. </p>
<p> Check for updates </p>
<p> iOS updates are a real amusement park. Or more precisely, a rollercoaster in an amusement park. At one moment you’re on top of the world, enjoying all the beautiful features Apple has given you. But at the very next moment, with the very next update, you’re terrified by all the issues that seemingly small update has caused to you. </p>
<p> Depending on when you’re reading this article, iOS may be going through a downward spiral of the current update, with iCloud backup being among the problems. To make sure that’s indeed the case, do a little research to see if others are complaining about the same issue in the very iOS version you have on your phone. </p>
<p> If the problem was indeed caused by an update, there’s probably not much you can do. You’ll have to wait for the next update and hope for the best. </p>
<p> Sign out of iCloud, and then back in again </p>
<p> As generic and cliche this is, and as much as I hate recommending this to my readers, I had to put it in the article. Just to make sure I included everything there is. And to beef up the word count a little bit. That’s important in today’s content marketing, you know. </p>
<p> All jokes and memes aside, there’s still a slight chance this one will work. So if you’ve already tried everything else, you might as well sign out and in to iCloud, just to be sure. </p>
<p> If you’re not sure how it’s done, here’s a quick set of instructions: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap your name, and go to Sign out. </p>
<p> Type your Apple ID password and tap Turn Off. </p>
<p> A window asking you which data you want to copy from your iCloud account to your phone will appear. Keep in mind that this might delete some data from your phone, so you’ll want to carefully read the instructions on this page. </p>
<p> Once you’ve decided what you want to keep, tap Sign Out. </p>
<p> Now that you’re signed out, head back to Settings, and go Sign in to your iPhone. </p>
<p> Enter your credentials, tap Next, enter your passcode, and you’re back in. </p>
<p> Reset your settings </p>
<p> And finally, if none of the solutions presented above resolved the iCloud backup problem, let’s turn to the last resort. And that’s resetting all settings. Now, you might want to think this one through, because it will, as you would’ve guessed, reset all your settings, but it may not resolve the problem at hand. And I’m sure you know how annoying will be to get all your settings back in order. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, if you can’t find any other solution, and you’re willing to risk, you might give this a shot. What’s positive about this method is that only reset your preferences, but keeps your content and personal data. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to General > Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset All Settings. </p>
<p> That’s it, all your settings are now reset. I surely hope this solution resolved the iCloud issue because the annoying task of re-adjusting your settings is now ahead of you. </p>
<p> I didn’t want to recommend to factory reset your phone because I simply don’t think it’s worth the risk. And you can easily lose something you don’t want to if you’re not careful enough. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope at least one of these solutions or “solutions” helped you resolve the problem with backing up your iPhone to iCloud. If you have any comments, questions, or maybe a better solution, feel free to write them down in the comments below. </p>

<p> Fix: Screen brightness unexpectedly dims on iPhone </p>
<p> It’s easy to overlook certain rad iOS features just because they’re not obvious. Nonetheless, we’re sure that without them, the premium nature of iPhone would fall below the expectations. On the other hand, if you are not informed about those features, they may appear to be a weird system issue or 3rd-party app’s error. </p>
<p> One user on Apple’s community forum experienced something strange in regard to screen brightness and we’re bringing you his/hers experience below: </p>
<p> ”I turned on the maximum brightness screen and I turned off the brightness mode but why when I turned on max brightness and I played the game for about 10 minutes then my screen light suddenly darkened To some extent but while the light bar in the control center is still the maximum. After I stop playing the game, the screen light will come back to normal after about 10 minutes! I do not understand what is happening on my device.” </p>
<p> You can find the explanation below. </p>
<p> Why may iPhone dim screen while gaming? </p>
<p> As you can see for yourself, this seems like a strange bug. But just on a first glance. This isn’t the problem but it’s rather a solution for overheating. If you have been using your device for the extended period of time, especially playing a demanding game, the phone will, logically, start to heat up. In order to prevent overheating and possible hardware damage, iOS software regulates certain processes in order to ”cool down” the device. </p>
<p> This is a standard practice, so you have nothing to worry about. Just leave your phone for some time and everything, including the screen brightness, will restore to normal values and activity. </p>
<p> These are some features that will be affected by the changes iOS inflicts in order to prevent the device from overheating: </p>
<p> Camera flash will be temporarily disabled. </p>
<p> Cellular radio will enter the low-energy state which might affect your signal and Mobile Data. </p>
<p> The display will dim or turn black temporarily. </p>
<p> If the device is plugged into the wall socket, it will stop charging. </p>
<p> If the temperatures are above the norms, you’ll see the emergency prompt that informs you about the current state. In order to use your device, you’ll need to wait for the cooldown. </p>
<p> How to speed up the cooldown process or even avoid heating? </p>
<p> You can speed up the cooldown by unplugging your device from a charger, avoiding sun exposure and just let it be. On the other hand, if you’re keen to prevent overheating, it’s paramount to use your handset only when it’s not charging. This especially comes into play when is hot outside. In addition, don’t expose it to sun or heat sources for the extended period of time. And, finally, if you run graphically demanding games, make sure to take a break from time to time. </p>
<p> We hope that this was a helpful read. What’s your experience with overheating? Please do share your thoughts in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Are people really complaining about a feature that’s designed to protect your phone from overheating? Wow…go ahead a switch to Samsung then and see how far that gets you when your phone catches on fire while playing games not entirely designed or necessary for A PHONE…because they don’t care about the integrity of their products OR their customers. Wake up people, it’s a phone, not an Xbox. As a matter of fact, go ahead and turn on your game console and play COD or PUBG for about 30 minutes and feel the console. That’s called a computer. They get hot.… Read more » </p>

<p> Can we escape this provlem (automatically reducing the brightness ) ? Can we turn off this feature? </p>
<p> the new 11 does this too. 10 or 20 minutes into playing PUB G the display maxes out at 50%. This is such a big design flaw and it’s really frustrating… </p>
<p> It’s not a design flaw. As stated in the above article, it is intentional so that the phone can cool down. If this feature wasn’t there, your phone may be damaged by the heat. </p>
<p> I’de rather my phone overheat and have to get a new one then interrupt my display during a game. They should have a way to turn this feature off, even if it has to come with a warning that violates warrantee or something. </p>
<p> I have the same problem with my iPhone and my iPad, I’m using outside in 18/ 20 degrees and the brightness keeps going low, so making both unusable, tbo I’m thinking of changing to another brand, Apple are taking the piss. </p>

<p> Fix: iPhone Stuck In Headphones Mode </p>
<p> As you probably know, the iPhone 7 and 7+ are missing the headphone jack. Some will say that is an upgrade, others are firmly against that decision. But, not so long ago we enjoyed our favorite music using headphones and standard 3.5mm jack. </p>
<p> Now, even though there are more than a few negative sides to wireless/Bluetooth headphones, they are, at least, less prone to hardware malfunctions comparing to previous Apple’s handsets. One issue that specially occupied our attention is sudden stuck in Headphone mode. Namely, users were unable to switch from Headphone mode to speakers. There are a few reasons for this and most common are: </p>
<p> Small object got somehow inside the jack. </p>
<p> Software bug. </p>
<p> Phone jack got wet. </p>
<p> For all of you that have exact or similar issues, we prepared a few troubleshoots with both hardware and software approach. Let’s get those speakers up and running. </p>
<p> How to unstuck iPhone from Headphone mode </p>
<p> Hard reset your iPhone </p>
<p> Your first step when addressing any software bug on iPhone is the hard reset. That should resolve mild issues, like the above-mentioned stuck. In order to perform a hard reset on iPhone, follow the instructions. </p>
<p> Press Sleep/Wake button and the Home button at the same time for 10 seconds. </p>
<p> Wait for Apple logo to appear and release the buttons. </p>
<p> Startup process may last longer than usual. </p>
<p> However, if this approach hasn’t resolved your issue, move on to next steps. </p>
<p> Switch to speakerphone while in-call </p>
<p> Some users managed to fix this issue with a simple workaround. Namely, they switched from standard in-call mode to speakerphone. It seems that this is an occasional glitch that puts your iPhone in a permanent Headphone mode. </p>
<p> Unplug your headphones. </p>
<p> Make a call. </p>
<p> While in-call, enable a speakerphone for 5 seconds. </p>
<p> Disable speakerphone and end call. </p>
<p> Additionally, some users tried another simple workaround with a silent mode. </p>
<p> Unplug headphones. </p>
<p> Turn the ringer back. </p>
<p> In case the issue is persistent, move down to additional steps. </p>
<p> Turn on/off Airplane mode </p>
<p> Airplane mode is another way to troubleshoot this issue. Namely, more than a few users succeeded to get out of the Headphone mode with this approach. </p>
<p> Swipe down for the Control Center. </p>
<p> Tap on the airplane icon to enable Airplane Mode. </p>
<p> Wait approximately 20 seconds and disable the Airplane Mode. </p>
<p> Unplug headphones. </p>
<p> If you’re still stuck in Headphone mode, move on to the next step. </p>
<p> Update iOS </p>
<p> Also, this bug (in case it’s a bug in first place) may be resolved with a system update. You should be timely prompted with the notification about latest updates, but you may as well check for those manually. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open General. </p>
<p> Tap Software update. </p>
<p> If an update is available, tap Download. </p>
<p> The latest system update may have addressed this glitch and you should be relieved of this annoyance. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings </p>
<p> Your final workaround for software related issue is the factory restore. If you were unsuccessful with previous steps, move on to factory reset. </p>
<p> To avoid possible issues, make sure your iPhone battery is full. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Choose Reset. </p>
<p> Select Erase All Content and Settings. </p>
<p> Have in mind that all of your data will be gone, so be sure to back it up before performing the reset. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and start the process. </p>
<p> Later on, you should choose Restore from the iCloud Backup feature, and retrieve your data. </p>
<p> If you are using iTunes, that can be much faster and reliable way to restore to factory settings. </p>
<p> Download and install the latest version of iTunes client on your PC. </p>
<p> Connect your device to a PC. </p>
<p> Start iTunes and choose Summary. </p>
<p> Remember to backup your data. </p>
<p> Select Restore iPhone. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and move on to restoring process. </p>
<p> Use hairdryer or compressed air to clean jack </p>
<p> Now we move on to hardware issues. The headphone jack is a quite sensitive part of your device, and arguably the one that is most prone to malfunction. Namely, the jack sensor is incredibly sensitive and any foreign object, no matter how small can cause a lot of trouble. In this case, send a wrong information that the headphones are plugged even though they’re not. </p>
<p> Moreover, if your phone gets wet, there is a great chance that that will cause an interference with a jack sensor. This should be addressed as soon as possible since untreated moisture can cause critical damage to your device. </p>
<p> So if you had any accidents that may affect your iPhone in exact or similar manners as mentioned above, your best bet is to use a hairdryer or canned compressed gas and clean the headphone jack. Also, don’t do that by mouth. You’ll moisturize it even more. </p>
<p> Clean jack with cotton bud </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you’re unable to clean the jack with a hairdryer or canned gas, your best bet is to use a cotton ear bud. Make sure to thoroughly clean the headphone jack in order to remove any small objects like sand, dirt or moisture. </p>
<p> Once you’ve cleaned your jack, the problem should be resolved. </p>
<p> With that, we surely covered the majority of the workarounds. However, if the problem is persistent, we strongly advise you to contact the Apple support. </p>

<p> Fix: iPhone won’t connect to iTunes in iOS 12 </p>
<p> If you’re an iPhone user and stray away from iTunes client, you’re making your life harder. This utility is there for ages and it’s as multifunctional as it is simple to use. However, some users reported that, after the iOS 12 update hit the deck, they’re unable to connect to iTunes on their PC or Mac, respectively. </p>
<p> We have some solutions for this ache, so feel free to check them out and tell us whether they helped you or not. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Update iTunes </p>
<p> First things first. Make sure that your device is unlocked and that you allowed the PC/Mac to access it. We suggest using the OEM-provided cable. Also, you can hold the power button and volume down key to reboot your device. After that, we need you to update iTunes. There are reports that state that, after the update, the iPhone/iPad with iOS 12 was able to connect. </p>
<p> After you get the latest iteration of iTunes, restart your PC, reconnect the device and try again. If the iPhone/iPad still won’t connect to iTunes, move onwards to next step. You can update your iTunes client in App Store on Mac or via the Apple Software Update client on Windows. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Reset Location & Privacy permissions </p>
<p> The thing with the iTunes client, security-wise, is that if you’ve denied the access on that particular PC once, that will make it permanent. Hence, you won’t be able to access the handset from that PC. </p>
<p> However, there’s a way to resolve this and it includes resetting the Location & Privacy settings to default values. This, of course, will erase your configuration for those respective settings, but you can tweak them out later on. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset Location & Privacy settings to default values: </p>
<p> Choose General. </p>
<p> Select Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Location & Privacy. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Restart the AMD service on your PC </p>
<p> The AMD (Apple Mobile Device) service needs to work in the background when the device is connected. Now, there are some instances when the aforementioned service doesn’t start. And that’s what might be the problem. Albeit, this is a general troubleshooting step and the issue emerged after the update, it’s still worth checking it out. </p>
<p> Also, we suggest disabling the third-party antivirus temporarily as it might block the connection. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do it on Windows PC: </p>
<p> Plug in your handset in your PC. </p>
<p> Press Windows key + R to open the Run command-line. </p>
<p> Type services.msc and press Enter. </p>
<p> Locate the Apple Mobile Device Service, right-click on it and disable it. </p>
<p> Right-click again and Enable the AMD service. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Update USB drivers </p>
<p> Drivers might be the reason for this malfunction, as well. What you need to do is to confirm the device is properly recognized by your PC or Mac. Faulty drivers on Mac are rarely an issue, but that’s not the case for Windows. On Windows, the device driver should be installed automatically, as soon as you plug in the device. But, that’s not always the case. </p>
<p> That’s why we suggest checking drivers in the Device Manager and updating them if updates are available. Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Plug in your handset into a PC port. </p>
<p> Open Run again and type devmgmt.msc. Press Enter. </p>
<p> Navigate to Universal Serial Bus Controllers and expand this section. </p>
<p> You should see “Apple Mobile Device USB driver” in the list. </p>
<p> If there’s a mark next to it, right-click on the device and uninstall the driver. </p>
<p> Unplug your handset and plug it in again. </p>
<p> Wait until the driver installs and try connecting to iTunes again. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Factory reset the phone </p>
<p> Finally, if everything worked fine until the iOS 12 was administered, you might want to reset your device to factory settings. Afterward, you can restore your backed data and settings from iCloud. Of course, usually, you can do the same with iTunes, if not for this error we’re trying to address. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset the device to factory values and try connecting to iTunes again: </p>
<p> Open General. </p>
<p> Select Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase All Content and Settings. </p>
<p> Skip restoring files from iCloud and try connecting to iTunes. </p>
<p> Restore your data from iCloud. </p>
<p> After that, you should be able to connect without issues. If the issue is persistent, try updating your device and send a ticket to Apple support so they can sort it out in one of the future updates. </p>

<p> How to fix iPhone X lags and stutters </p>
<p> It’s out of the question that the iPhone X is a revolutionary phone in terms of features and abilities. But it’s also revolutionary and trend-setting in terms of pricing. And for a phone that costs $1000+, you expect to get a little piece of perfection. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, nothing in this world is perfect, and neither is the iPhone X. I imagine your disappointment when you found out that your expensive phone is lagging and performs poorly. But worry not, because the iPhone X is amazingly optimized, and sometimes even a small tweak can make a big difference. </p>
<p> So, if you’re cursing the day you paid that much for a phone – don’t! Instead, check out the solutions presented below, and I hope you’ll be able to make your phone as swift as the wind once again. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Update your phone </p>
<p> Unlike the hardware, iOS updates are not always so well-optimized. Mostly because developers simply don’t have enough time to test them throughout. So, the lagging/stuttering problem on your iPhone X may be coming from the software-end, after all. Especially if we keep in mind that almost every iOS update (even the minor ones) causes some problems to some users. </p>
<p> If a faulty update is indeed the problem, the lagging problem will simply resolve itself. As soon as Apple releases a new update. So, don’t panic, and keep going through the stutter, everything will fall into its own place soon. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Update your apps </p>
<p> The same thing applies to iOS apps. In the beginning, most of them weren’t even optimized for the iPhone x. Luckily, by now (almost a year after the iPhone X release), everything should work seamlessly. But even though apps look good on your phone, that doesn’t mean something else inside them doesn’t cause the lag. </p>
<p> So, head over to the App Store and make sure all your apps are up to date. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Keep an eye on storage </p>
<p> That 256GB of storage should be enough, right? Well, you’d be surprised how fast you can fulfill even a huge storage capacity for smartphone standards that the iPhone X boasts. And be honest, what was the last time you checked on the available storage on your phone? </p>
<p> Just like it’s the case with any smartphone/computer/everything, full storage capacity usually means slower performance. So, just to be sure, head over to Settings and check your storage. </p>
<p> In case you’re not sure how just follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Tap Settings from the Home screen. </p>
<p> Tap General > [Device] Storage. </p>
<p> Here you’ll find numerous optimization tips to free up some storage space. Act according to these tips, or delete some unused apps, or even move some of your pictures and music to iCloud. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Close some apps </p>
<p> The fact that the iPhone X is such a powerful device probably makes you think you can put as much weight on it as you want. Well, you’re wrong. Everything has its breaking point, and so does the iPhone X. </p>
<p> So, before you carry on with troubleshooting process, open the Task Manager and close some apps you’re not using. Once again, you might be surprised with how many apps you actually have running. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Turn Off Background App Refresh and Location services </p>
<p> A lot of users have reported that two particular services tend to make their phones a bit sluggish. These services are the Background App Refresh service and (surprisingly) the Location service. So, we’re going to temporarily disable these services to see if it makes the difference. </p>
<p> To disable Background App Refresh, simply go to Settings > General, and switch Background App Refresh off. </p>
<p> To disable the Location service, do the following: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll down and open Privacy > Location Services. </p>
<p> Toggle the Location Services button off. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Reset all settings </p>
<p> If you still can’t find the real culprit of the problem, maybe it’s time for some resetting. First thing first, we’re going to reset your settings. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to General > Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset All Settings. </p>
<p> Solution 7 – Factory reset your phone </p>
<p> And finally, as a last resort and if none of the previous solutions worked, you can also try with factory resetting your phone. But remember to do this only if you can’t find any other solution to the lagging problem. </p>
<p> Also, remember to back up all your files and data so you can restore them quickly after. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and start the process (later on, you can choose Restore from the iCloud Backup feature). </p>
<p> That’s about it. I certainly hope at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the lagging and stuttering problem on your iPhone X. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, just write them down below in the comments. </p>

<p> iPhone X overheats while charging: What to do? </p>
<p> The iPhone X is a powerful beast! But that doesn’t mean you should treat one like it’s on steroids. Or should you…? One would say a $1000+ priced phone should be able to withstand the toughest hurdles. But it still isn’t the Nokia 3310. </p>
<p> Anyway, let’s leave the debate about whether the iPhone X is powerful enough for its price for another time. We have bigger issues now. </p>
<p> The phenomenon of the iPhone X overheating whiled plugged in is still some sort of a mystery. Some people blame it on the software; Some people believe it’s actually careless users’ fault. Either theory could be true. Depending on how users actually use their phones. There’s really no clear and straightforward answer that can be applied to 100% of the cases. </p>
<p> So, we’re going to look at the problem from both perspectives. And you’ll draw the conclusion yourself. </p>
<p> iPhone X overheating – a software issue </p>
<p> Was the massive overheating caused by some bug in iOS 11? The truth is, we don’t really know. Apple has never acknowledged this particular issue officially. And without an official statement, we can only “accuse” Apple of “planting” some kind of a bug into its OS intentionally. But we can hardly transform that into something bigger than just a rumor. </p>
<p> NOTE: In case you’ve found some evidence to back this theory up, please share it with the rest of us. </p>
<p> The company did, however, give users a few tips on how to keep their iPhone X cool (or at least at the normal temperature). But, we believe that has nothing to do with the overheating issue users have been talking about for the past couple of months. It was just a regular set of tips, that you get with basically any piece of hardware you buy. Some type of stuff you’d put in the user manual. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, we don’t know much better than those ‘regular’ tips. In fact, the majority of this article’s second part consists of Apple’s advice. </p>
<p> So, if you already had a chance to read what Apple has to say about the overheating issue. And you’ve tried everything from the ‘list’, you’re not going to learn much from this article. </p>
<p> If that’s indeed the case, you may say the issue is probably software-wise. And there’s really nothing you can do about it. Except waiting for a new OS update that may (or may not) resolve the issue. But then again, everyone’s innocent until proven guilty. </p>
<p> One thing you should definitely be happy about is that iOS 12 is just around the corner. Since Apple will make a lot of efforts to polish the OS on the inside, there’s a good chance your overheating issues will vanish with the new version of iOS. At least we hope so. </p>
<p> iPhone X overheating – Careless use </p>
<p> Now we know that we know nothing about whether the problem is being caused by the software. So, let’s stop blaming Apple for a second and flip the coin to your side, dear user. Are you really using your precious iPhone X with care? Is there anything you do with your phone that may cause it to overheat? </p>
<p> If you’re not sure about the answer, just go through the following tips. Of course, it might not be your fault at all. Maybe some app or service is causing your phone to overheat. And that brings us back to the aforementioned endless circle, so stop worrying and do some tweaking. </p>
<p> Yes, the tips are mainly some basic stuff you’d probably hear from an average “Apple engineer”, but these might be helpful, after all. So, at least give it a thought. </p>
<p> Don’t fast-charge while gaming </p>
<p> Don’t drink and drive, don’t fast-charge and game! Plain and simple. Since the fast-charging still isn’t the most advanced feature out there, using it alone will put a solid amount of pressure on your device. Combine that with giving your phone additional challenge of running a big 3D game, and you get a recipe for overheating. </p>
<p> The good thing about fast-charging is that it, well, charges your phone fast. So, be patient for some short period of time, and let your phone charge. Once it gets fully charged, carry on with your favorite game. I’m sure it can wait a few minutes. </p>
<p> Remove the case </p>
<p> It’s hasn’t been scientifically proven that the phone case causes overheating. But the popular belief says it has some impact. Since most cases are made of plastic, they tend to keep some heat in and cold out. </p>
<p> Depending on the material of your case, you can experiment with this. Take the case off for some time, and see if there’s any difference. If the phone indeed gets hotter when in the case, gett another one, or takie it off while charging. </p>
<p> Don’t leave your phone in direct sunlight </p>
<p> Feel free to pull the Captain Obvious meme here. But for real, tasks that we consider automated are easily overlooked. That’s psychology, I guess. </p>
<p> Just make sure you don’t leave your phone exposed to direct sunlight (most often on the seat of your car) for too long. Nothing more to say here, really. You already know everything. So, just look at this as a simple reminder, that’s all. </p>
<p> Disable unnecessary services </p>
<p> Now that we’ve covered the outside factors, let’s do a couple of tweaks that should contribute to cooling down your iPhone. </p>
<p> The first thing you should pay attention to is running the necessary services only. You don’t really need Bluetooth and AirDrop running all the time. So, make sure to disable all the services and features you’re not using at the moment. </p>
<p> On top of that, use the new task manager to close some apps running in the background. Who knows, maybe the cause of overheating lays somewhere in there. </p>
<p> Disable Background App Refresh </p>
<p> The reason why we’re giving more attention to Background App Refresh compared to other services is because a lot of users actually reported disabling this feature actually makes difference. It may or may not cool down your phone. But it won’t hurt if you give it a try. </p>
<p> To disable Background App Refresh, simply go to Settings > General, and switch Background App Refresh off. </p>
<p> Reset Settings </p>
<p> If you’re still having overheating issues after all, and you can’t determine the factor, your best bet is probably resetting all settings. The best bet yes, but not the safest one. Because you could end up with all your settings revamped and with the overheating issue still present. So, think about if you’re willing to make a risk. </p>
<p> If you do, here’s how to reset all your settings at once: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to General > Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset All Settings. </p>
<p> Confirm and wait for the process to finish. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I know this article didn’t really make things clearer, but I hope at least it helped you cool down your phone. </p>
<p> If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, feel free to leave them in the comments down below. Once again, any additional evidence will be highly appreciated! </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/itunes-play-only-one-song-fix" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844083" filename="itunes-play-only-one-song-fix">
<p> Fix: iTunes on iPhone play only one song on the playlist </p>
<p> If you’re using iPhone, there’s a great chance that your go-to music player is iTunes. At least it’s there by default so you’ll probably be using it occasionally. It kind of copies the overall simplicity of the iOS, but some users have had a few dilemmas in regard to playback of their favorite tracks. </p>
<p> Namely, they suddenly got stuck with only one song playing instead of the whole playlist. The next enlisted song just won’t start and they’re forced to hear only that one song for ages. The only way for them to play something else was to manually choose another song. Luckily, this is a simple ”issue” to address, and the how-tos are presented below. </p>
<p> How to resolve ”iTunes repeating one song all the time” on iPhone </p>
<p> Restart music app </p>
<p> The first thing you should do is to restart the music app. Sometimes, due to a bug (users report that is resolved on iOS 10), playlist repeats only one song for no obvious reason. So, what you’ll need to do is to force stop the app and start it again. That way, you should be able to clear the bug at hand and your list should move on instead of one song repeating all day long like a broken record. </p>
<p> Double-click the Home button. </p>
<p> Swipe right until you reach the music app. </p>
<p> Swipe it up to close it. </p>
<p> Additionally, you might want to restart your phone just in case something else is affecting your custom playlist: </p>
<p> Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button. </p>
<p> After it appears, use the slider to turn your device Off. </p>
<p> After the device turns off, use Sleep/Wake button to turn it ON again. </p>
<p> Disable Repeat </p>
<p> One thing that’s easy to overlook but it’s obvious if you think it through, is the Repeat button. As you may know, besides the standard functions in a player (Play, Pause, Rewind), we also have Shuffle (this randomises playlist) and Repeat (repeats one track or a whole playlist). Due to some inconsistencies of the player’s user interface on different iOS iterations, people tend to get lost and forget about the repeat button location. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to check have you accidentally enabled repeat for the single track: </p>
<p> Open iTunes. </p>
<p> Tap on the current song to extend it on the full-screen. </p>
<p> Swipe up to reveal the Repeat button. </p>
<p> If the Repeat button is enabled, tap once to disable it. </p>
<p> That should resolve your problem. Additionally, if you’re still stuck, make sure to update your iOS to the latest version. </p>
<p> This should conclude this article. We hope that was a helpful read. If you have additional issues or questions, be sure to tell us in the comments section down below. We look forward to hearing from you. Have a good day and thank you for reading. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/lg-nexus-5x-bugs" parent_folder="web1" id="file17846795" filename="lg-nexus-5x-bugs">
<p> LG Nexus 5X most common issues and how to solve them! </p>
<p> LG in cooperation with Google has made some interesting phones that produced quite a stir in the market. The main reason for their instant popularity is stable Android support similar to the one for the Pixel phones. And the Nexus 5x, a successor of the Nexus 5, is one of the best Android devices produced by LG with reliable hardware and clean Android OS. </p>
<p> However, while this is an exquisite mid-budget phone, it isn’t without issues. Users around the world reported a large variety of problems and we’ll try to list the most important ones today. Have in mind that some of these issues are provoked by a hardware malfunction. On the other hand, the ones with the software background may have a solution and we’ll be sure to let you know about it. </p>
<p> Google Now broke feed </p>
<p> As we already stated, the best thing about Nexus phones is frequent Android support. You don’t get OS with bloatware but the latest Pixel-like upgrades. And it that’s not the same for a multitude of manufacturers. Android Nougat 7.0 upgrade has been available for a while with Google Now assistant. </p>
<p> However, comparing to the Pixel, Google Now on the Nexus 5x isn’t always remarkable. Few users reported a specific bug on Google AI personal assistant. Namely, the feed cards won’t load. The users are informed that this occurs due to lack of storage space. However, it seems that the storage space is not the problem. We advise you to try and update Google Now in the Play Store. If the problem is persistent, check the instructions below. </p>
<p> Go to Your Feed section. </p>
<p> Turn feed off. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> If the problem is still persistent, delete your preferences in Your Feed section. That will clean your settings, but you’ll be able to see Feed cards again. </p>
<p> WiFi issues </p>
<p> It’s not as common as with some other handsets, but the Nexus 5x occasionally has an unstable connection or no connection at all. We advise you to follow these steps below in order to troubleshoot these issues and use the full potential of WiFi. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz. </p>
<p> Additionally, crowded places like public WiFi spots can vastly affect connection stability. So, it’s not a viable option for testing/troubleshooting connectivity issues. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> Besides WiFi, Bluetooth is another feature that has connectivity issues. More than a few users reported failed connection with a car system or headset. If the problem is present with multiple devices, then you should wait for the firmware update. In case you have issues with one specific device connection, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Reconnect the devices </p>
<p> Delete all pairings and connect again. </p>
<p> Disable other network services while using Bluetooth (Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G). </p>
<p> In case the problem is persistent on multiple pairing devices, even after an update, we advise you to take the Nexus 5x to the vendor for inspection. </p>
<p> Boot loop issue </p>
<p> One grave problem that is, luckily, not that common is the boot loop issue. Namely, a few users reported that their Nexus 5x freezes. That is allegedly followed by the shutdown and, after a restart, the device works for a couple of minutes and stop again. Additionally, it seems to occur after an update to Nougat. </p>
<p> That is a major problem and can its occurrence can have various reasons. Good thing though is that this is most of the time a software issue. But, if your hardware is the problem, send a ticket to Google or tech support of the device vendor. </p>
<p> You can easily find out the culprit for this issue by following these steps. </p>
<p> While charging, restart your phone by holding Power button and Volume down key for a couple of seconds. </p>
<p> Wait for a minute or so for the bootloader to start. </p>
<p> If the bootloader starts – hardware is the culprit. </p>
<p> In case the bootloader won’t start – Nougat update made a total chaos. </p>
<p> In both scenarios, you’ll need advanced practitioners to check your phone. It probably needs flashing. Too bad that users that got this problem had a lot of problems with responsible services. It’s their job to fix or replace your phone as soon as possible. </p>
<p> Proximity sensor issue </p>
<p> Some users reported issues with the proximity sensor’s behavior. Namely, as you may know, the proximity sensor’s (placed beside a speaker) main role is to regulate display on/off while you are talking and after the call is finished. So, every time you distance your phone from your ear, the display should turn on. But, it seems that this is isn’t functioning as supposed. You can’t hang up or, for example, use loudspeaker because the screen is off. You must press Power button multiple times in order to retrieve the screen commands. </p>
<p> This can be both software and hardware issue respectively. For hardware, you should check out for physical barrier your screen guard may create. Additionally, you may use certain diagnostic apps to check out sensor functionality. The near/far scale should vary from 0 to 2 inches. </p>
<p> When it comes to the software, things may take the wrong turn with the latest update. The smallest code error can render the proximity sensor faulty or unusable. What can you do? Well, besides waiting for the next update, you may also set up Power button as a go-to button to end calls. That way you’ll make a temporary solution before the things are resolved. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Accessibility. </p>
<p> Enable Power Button Ends Call. </p>
<p> Keyboard issue </p>
<p> Besides the usual problems that occur occasionally with most of Android handsets, the Nexus 5x has an issue with the keyboard. Of course, we are talking about native Google keyboard since the alternative solutions can have specific errors of their own. According to some users, the keyboard is unresponsive or laggy while trying to input text, especially in 3rd-party apps (WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook Messanger etc.). Moreover, key sounds delay is noticed. Additionally, latency intensifies when the phone is charging. </p>
<p> This may be fixed with some of the upcoming updates. But, while you are waiting for developers to address this issue, you’ll probably want to try some of this workarounds. </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Don’t use the phone while charging. Some users reported better performance after changing the charger. </p>
<p> Disable autocorrect and autofill features. </p>
<p> Clear personal dictionary and keyboard app cache and data. </p>
<p> Wipe the system cache partition. </p>
<p> In addition, you may try 3rd-party keyboards that suit you best, like Swiftkey. </p>
<p> Lags and stutters </p>
<p> Even though the Nexus 5x packs a quite powerful CPU, some of you occasionally experienced stutters and lags. Since this is one of the best-optimized devices you’ll find on the market, third-party apps that work in the background are the main suspect. But, we won’t exclude the unoptimized firmware update, either. </p>
<p> With some users, this issue takes much larger proportions and the phone is mostly unusable. Have in mind that can be also related to hardware failure. Follow the instructions below to try and resolve lag issues. </p>
<p> Reboot your phone. </p>
<p> Uninstall recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Wipe System Cache Partition </p>
<p> Reset the phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to Wipe System Cache Partition. </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate trough the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> The process should last for approximately 10 minutes. Do not interrupt it. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to perform a backup and Factory reset. You’ll need your Google username and password in order to backup your data. Also, all your data will be wiped out, so you should backup your data to PC. It is advised to clean the SD, as well. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Open Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to the cloud. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> Apps crash </p>
<p> Besides the complex issues that impact the overall performance, some apps may be faulty on their own. Even though it’s not dangerous at first sight, app crashes can lead to stutters and lags mentioned above and there so affect workflow drastically. This mostly occurs with third-party rogue apps, but the built-in apps are not an exception. </p>
<p> You can fix crashing apps with few workarounds and prevent them from making larger issues. </p>
<p> Clear apps Cache. </p>
<p> Clear apps Data. </p>
<p> Update apps via Play Store. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app (roll back to factory version with built-in apps). </p>
<p> Start the phone in Safe mode to look for interfering apps. </p>
<p> Press and hold the power button while the screen is on. </p>
<p> Tap and hold the Power off on the screen. </p>
<p> When prompted, press OK to enter Safe mode. </p>
<p> Wrap-up </p>
<p> That should do it. For the end, please don’t this round-up trick you into thinking that Nexus 5x is a bad phone. It’s great. Most of the time. But, it isn’t Pixel, the Google’s favorite child, as well. </p>
<p> If you have any questions or additional issues you want to address, please do tell us in the comments. We’ll be glad to help. </p>

<p> Fix: Users unable to start Location services in iOS </p>
<p> With all those location-dependent apps nowadays, users are compelled to use Location Services. If you’re roaming through maps or waiting for Uber, you won’t be able to do much without GPS. With the privacy question arising, you still need to take a good thought before you enable it permanently for certain apps. </p>
<p> However, some users have had a hard time enabling it, in the first place. Due to some peculiar reasons, the services just won’t start and that renders certain apps completely unusable. </p>
<p> Because of that, we enlisted some workarounds you should take into consideration if you’ve had experienced this issue. You can find explanations below. </p>
<p> How to resolve Location issues in iOS </p>
<p> Restart your device and make sure that the services are properly enabled </p>
<p> In regards to simplicity of solutions, iOS issues are somewhat easier to address. If not for anything else, then for the sole reason that it has a more homogeneous platform. A simple restart can sometimes make miracles happen. Follow the instructions below to restart your iPhone or iPad: </p>
<p> Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button. </p>
<p> After it appears, use the slider to turn your device Off. </p>
<p> Once the device turns off, use Sleep/Wake button to turn it On again. </p>
<p> After that, (even though it sounds a bit too obvious) make sure that Location services are enabled in the first place. Follow the procedure below to confirm that everything is set as it’s supposed to be: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Privacy. </p>
<p> Tap Location Services. </p>
<p> Toggle Location Services ON. </p>
<p> The list of apps that use Location services will appear. </p>
<p> You can tap on the individual apps and choose one of 3 options from the pop-up list: </p>
<p> Never – this app doesn’t have permission to access Location services. </p>
<p> While Using the App – this app can use Location services only while is active. </p>
<p> Always – this app is allowed to use Location services always. </p>
<p> After you’ve dealt with that, you can try using some location-related apps and look for changes. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings </p>
<p> If the issue surpasses the initial troubleshooting, we might need to change the approach. Namely, some users managed to resolve issues within the Location services feature by resetting Network settings. Thus, it’s not exactly related (it covers more Wi-Fi, Data, and Bluetooth), it might help you address the issue at hand. But, have in mind that this procedure will erase all network-related settings, so you may need to set those again. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to reset Network settings in iOS: </p>
<p> Change restrictions (Parental control) </p>
<p> Even though some recent happenings made some people doubt overall iOS privacy and security (don’t forget Uber tracking scandal), we’re still talking about a premium protection. So, the app you try to use in combination with GPS (Location services) might be restricted from enabling Location services. Because of that, obviously, Location service will fail to start within the named app. In addition, there’s a 4-digits password you’ll need to enter in order to change settings. If you haven’t changed it, its default value is 0000. </p>
<p> In order to change possibly inflicted restriction on a certain app, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Select Restrictions. </p>
<p> Tap Location settings. </p>
<p> Update iOS </p>
<p> Updates are essential. Especially when some system feature starts misbehaving. For that reason, we urge you to check for updates. Apple is currently distributing iOS 10.3.3, so you should update whenever you have time to spare. In addition, if Location services won’t function within the specific app, updating the app might help. Even reinstalling it, if you want to be thorough. </p>
<p> This is how to update your iOS to latest stable version: </p>
<p> Backup your device via iCloud or iTunes. </p>
<p> Make sure you have a stable Wi-Fi connection and the full battery before the process starts. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open General. </p>
<p> Tap Software Update. </p>
<p> If an update is available, tap Download and Install. </p>
<p> And these instructions should inform you on how to update an app: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Open App Store and search for the app. </p>
<p> Tap and install it. </p>
<p> Restore device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps worked in your favor, you might be stuck with a factory reset. It can be a pain to go through the complete procedure, but, more times than not, even the most resilient issues are resolved that way. There are 2 ways to restore your device to factory settings, and we’re bringing you both below. It’s yours to choose which one you want to use. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Start iTunes and choose Summary. </p>
<p> Remember to backup your iPhone data. </p>
<p> Select Restore iPhone. </p>
<p> That should do it. We hope that one of those resolved your issues with Location services in your iOS. Make sure to share your thoughts, questions, or suggestions in the comments section below. </p>

<p> How to lock iPhone apps with Face ID (and why you can’t) </p>
<p> Protecting your iPhone apps with Face ID is a tempting concept. Especially if you value privacy and security, and don’t mind waiting an extra second or doing an extra step for the sake of keeping your data safe. </p>
<p> It’s possible to protect your iPhone apps with Face ID, but only to some extent. Namely, you can only use Face ID with the apps that support it. And you can count those apps on your fingers. For every other app, you’ll have to accept that you can’t secure it with Face ID. At least not without jailbreaking your phone. </p>
<p> I wish I could tell you about some way to hack the system, but it’s simply not possible. Whether you can lock an app with Face ID is strictly a developer’s choice. So I’ll try and explain why’s that the case, and how to at least protect the apps that support this feature. </p>
<p> Apps that natively support Face ID </p>
<p> As I said, there’s only a small number of apps that allow you to lock them with Face ID. That’s because developers of these apps had to specifically integrate the Face ID support into the apps’ code. Other developers simply opted not to, as they assume such feature isn’t integral for the functioning of their apps. </p>
<p> Apple is one of those developers. Out of all the first-party apps, you can only secure Apple Notes with Face ID. No other Apple app supports this option. So, forget about protecting your Photos with Face ID. </p>
<p> But we’ll get to that later. For now, let’s focus on the apps that allow you to protect them with Face ID. Although there aren’t as many apps that support biometrics, I couldn’t list all of them. So, I’ll only go through some of the most popular apps. But you’ll get the idea of how its done, even if the app you’re looking for isn’t on the list. </p>
<p> Here are some of the most popular apps that support Face ID: </p>
<p> Now, let’s quickly run through some of the popular apps, and you’ll see. </p>
<p> How to protect WhatsApp with Face ID </p>
<p> If WhatsApp is your primary messaging app, and you don’t want anyone to access your messages, protecting WhatsApp with Face ID is a good idea. You can easily do that by following these instructions: </p>
<p> Open WhatsApp </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Account. </p>
<p> Head over to Privacy > Screen Lock. </p>
<p> How to protect Dropbox with Face ID </p>
<p> For those of you who prefer storing your files to Dropbox over Google Drive or iCloud, you can add an extra layer of security with FaceID. Here’s how to protect Dropbox with Face ID: </p>
<p> Open Dropbox. </p>
<p> Go to Account from the bottom bar, and head over to Settings (the gear icon in the upper left corner). </p>
<p> Choose Turn Passcode On. </p>
<p> Choose your Dropbox passcode. </p>
<p> Enable Use Face ID. </p>
<p> Next time you open Dropbox, just allow it to use the Face ID data, and you’re good to go. </p>
<p> How to protect Google Drive with Face ID </p>
<p> If Google Drive is your preferred cloud storage service, setting up the Face ID lock is as simple as it gets. However, it only applies to the Google Drive app itself. So, it won’t lock other Google apps that are connected to Drive, like Photos. </p>
<p> Here’s how to protect Google Drive with Face ID: </p>
<p> Open Google Drive. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Privacy Screen. </p>
<p> Enable Privacy Screen. </p>
<p> How to protect Apple Notes with Face ID </p>
<p> You can’t protect most of Apple’s native apps with Face ID, but Apple Notes is an exception. In fact, the app even allows you to protect each note with biometrics data, for even more security. </p>
<p> Although the whole process requires a few more steps than protecting other apps, it’s as simple and straightforward as it gets. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Notes. </p>
<p> Go to Password. </p>
<p> Fill in the required password fields and enable Face ID. You just set the universal settings that will apply to each note you choose to lock. </p>
<p> Now, head over to Notes, find the note you want to protect, tap and hold it to open the haptic menu and choose Lock note. </p>
<p> The app will automatically lock the chosen note with the password you set beforehand and your Face ID data. </p>
<p> How to protect Amazon with Face ID </p>
<p> Amazon doesn’t exactly do the best job of protecting its app, but the Face ID integration is still there. While you can’t use Face ID when opening the app, Amazon requires Face ID (or password) when you’re accessing the sensitive parts of your account. </p>
<p> To make sure Face ID is enabled, head over to Settings > Amazon, and make sure the Use Biometrics authentication when available option is enabled. </p>
<p> How to protect Apple App Store with Face ID </p>
<p> You don’t need to do anything to protect the App Store with Face ID. That’s because the Face ID protection is already enabled by default. You can’t install an app or make a purchase without having to pass Face ID first. </p>
<p> But I’m going to show you how to turn this option on/off, just in case something goes wrong. I also don’t recommend disabling Face ID authentication in the App Store, because it’s just one extra step that may potentially save your skin in some extreme scenarios. </p>
<p> To enable/disable Face ID authentication in the App Store, do the following: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Face ID & Passcode. </p>
<p> Enable/disable iTunes & App Store. </p>
<p> Why can’t you lock all apps with Face ID? </p>
<p> Naturally, you could ask: “Why can’t I use Face ID with every app?” It’s a legit question, but asking it neglects the important factor that makes the whole idea impossible. </p>
<p> Let’s start with Face ID itself. As soon as Apple introduced the technology with the iPhone X back in 2017, security alerts went red. The idea of giving their face data to a huge corporation scared a lot of people. </p>
<p> However, Apple was ready to tackle the suspicion by clarifying that one’s face data is only stored locally, in a special part of the processor called Security Enclave. Not a single bit of face data is being uploaded to Apple’s servers. Moreover, Face ID doesn’t use the visual image of your face, but only a mathematical representation of it. </p>
<p> I don’t want to get too technical here, so if you want to learn more about how Face ID works, check Apple’s official documentation. </p>
<p> In an era when businesses are being built around selling users’ data, Apple’s decision not to share sensitive face data was highly praised. It made perfect sense for Apple since the company makes most of its money selling hardware. The software just comes as a part of the package. Apple just doesn’t need to sell (all of the users’) data to turn a profit, as it’s already the richest company in the world. On top of that, promising users a sense of security is probably the best PR move a tech company can make today. </p>
<p> But when the original hype settled down, Apple spoiled the good impression to some extent. While keeping the actual Face ID data secured and stored locally, the company provided an API to third-party developers that will allow them to exploit some of the iPhone’s face recognition functionalities. </p>
<p> Using that API, developers can make apps that will turn your face into an emoji and mimic your expressions in real-time, add flashy filters for social media, etc. In essence, an app can capture your face’s visual image, and do basically anything with it. But that’s only allowed in-app. So, an app can “have” your face, but only if you willingly capture it. Other, more sensitive actions, like unlocking the phone or face authentication are beyond the reach. </p>
<p> To finally clarify the possible confusion, apps that use Face ID for protection never get to access the Face ID data. An app is only notified as to whether the authentication was successful. Once an app receives a positive “signal”, it lets you proceed. </p>
<p> You can read more about what apps can and can’t do with Face ID here. </p>
<p> That brings us to developers. With everything above being said, it’s obvious that the choice is solely on them. If developers think implementing the Face ID integration is necessary, they will have it. Using this feature makes sense for banking apps or storage services. However, developers of more casual apps simply don’t want to go through the extra trouble. Mostly for the sake of convenience. </p>
<p> From the users’ perspective, the only thing left for arguing is whether a certain app needs Face ID protection or not. And if you think about it, most of them don’t. Using Face ID with every single app will only bring unnecessary hassle. After all, the whole iOS experience is about convenience and simplicity. </p>
<p> On the other hand, I also understand those of you who are willing to trade convenience for security. But my question is, can you really do that today? </p>
<p> 1 COMMENT </p>

<p> How to fix low Bluetooth volume on Android </p>
<p> There are two types of smartphone users. Those that are not fond of headphone jack removal and those that don’t mind it all that much. We all know that a Bluetooth headset will never be able to replicate sound from good old wired headphones. Especially if the volume on Bluetooth earphones is too low and users can’t increase it above a certain point. </p>
<p> There’s seemingly a workaround for this that allows users to increase the volume of Bluetooth headphones. We made sure to share it with you below. </p>
<p> How do I increase the volume on my Bluetooth earphones? </p>
<p> In order to protect users from potential hearing damage, Android’s limit on max volume is quite low for Bluetooth audio devices. </p>
<p> Now, before Android 7 Nougat, there were separate controls and thus separate volume sliders so users were able to go for the actual max volume on Bluetooth speakers or earphones. </p>
<p> After Android 7 was introduced, this option was gone. This, of course, wasn’t a major issue when the majority of headphones were wired. Today, however, we have a trend of removing the 3.5mm headphone jack and wireless headphones are taking over. </p>
<p> Which gets us to the point of this article. How to change this and increase volume on Bluetooth earphones. The solution is rather simple, and it only requires accessing Developer options. Once there, you should disable the Absolute volume toggle. </p>
<p> After that, your Bluetooth volume and device volume controls will work separately. Not to mention that the limiting imposed by the Android system will be gone, so you’ll be able to max the volume at your own volition and to full capabilities of your Bluetooth earphones or headphones. </p>
<p> If you are unsure how to access Developer options and disable Absolute volume toggle, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Open About phone. </p>
<p> Locate the Build number and tap it 7 times in succession to enable Developer options. </p>
<p> Now, you should see Developer options in Settings > System. </p>
<p> Scroll down until you reach the Networking section. </p>
<p> Once there, enable (toggle ON) the Disable absolute volume option. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and you should have more control over the volume of Bluetooth devices. </p>
<p> That’s it. If you need additional settings, tweaking equalizer, you can look into Sound settings. And for all of you advanced users with rooted devices, there are a few Magisk modules that might help with the audio output significantly. </p>
<p> Thank you for reading and make sure to tell us if this was helpful in the comments section below. In case you have any questions or suggestions, we encourage you to share them with us, too. </p>

<p> In “8. Reboot your device”, do you mean reboot the phone, or the Bluetooth device? </p>
<p> Just in case you were still wondering, the author meant for us to reboot the phone. The bluetooth device should automatically reconnect once the phone has powered back on. </p>

<p> Fix: Messenger not sending pictures on Android </p>
<p> More than a few Facebook Messenger users have had a hard time with media in their messages. Namely, it seems that Facebook Messenger is not sending pictures on Android. Not after multiple tries. We made sure to help affected users resolve this as fast as possible. </p>
<p> Why won’t Facebook Messenger send pictures? </p>
<p> There are more than a few reasons why Facebook Messenger won’t send pictures on Android. The first one is server status, which might be down for all or some users. Additionally, the local cache might get corrupted or time/date settings are not right. </p>
<p> To tackle these and other possible culprits for this issue, make sure to go through the list below. </p>
<p> 1. Check permissions </p>
<p> The common bug that’s causing this problem usually prevents users from sending pictures or even text messages to users that recently re-activated their Facebook accounts (Facebook Messenger accounts, too). What you should do is simply un-friend that user and be-friend him/her again. If pictures won’t go through after that, continue reading. </p>
<p> Let’s start by checking all permissions to ensure that Facebook Messenger has access to both your locale storage and the SD card. Sometimes, users accidentally dismiss the prompt which asks for the storage access. If that’s the case, you won’t be able to send or save images in Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> With that said, navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Facebook Messenger. Once there, make sure that all related permissions are granted. You don’t have to grant Location, Contacts, or SMS permissions. </p>
<p> 2. Clear cache and data from the Messenger </p>
<p> The second step is to clear cache and data from the Messenger and reset the app that way. Many issues in Android apps can be addressed by clearing the cache and data from the app. </p>
<p> Follow these steps, to clear cache and data from Facebook Messenger: </p>
<p> Tap All apps (App manager or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Reboot your device, log in to your Messenger account again. </p>
<p> 3. Check Date and Time Settings </p>
<p> If Facebook Messenger is still not sending pictures on Android, make sure that your time and date are properly set. Like with the majority of instant messengers, media and text messages go to a dedicated server and are later (in a matter of seconds) distributed to recipients. </p>
<p> To ensure that there are no issues with the dedicated servers, you’ll need to have proper time and date set. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to check the time and date and set them accordingly: </p>
<p> Choose System or Additional settings. </p>
<p> Open Date & time. </p>
<p> Toggle ON the “Use network-provided time” option. </p>
<p> 4. Reinstall the app </p>
<p> Moving on, you can also try reinstalling the app if the previous steps failed to resolve the problem. There’s no big difference between this and clearing cache and data, but it’s worth a try, especially because you’ll get the latest version of Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reinstall Facebook Messenger on Android: </p>
<p> Navigate again to Settings > Apps > All apps > Messenger. </p>
<p> Uninstall the app and clear cache and data when prompted. </p>
<p> 5. Check SD card </p>
<p> There’s an extra layer of security and system permissions when it comes to accessing the external storage. We hope you covered that in the first step we listed here. However, your SD card can still cause issues, due to corruption or if not properly placed in the slot. </p>
<p> If you are unable to access files on the SD card on your Android device from any other app, make sure to format it. For the majority of apps, the better option is formatting SD cards as external storage rather than the internal one. </p>
<p> 6. Leave the Beta program </p>
<p> If you are part of the Beta program for Facebook Messenger, make sure to leave it and look for improvements. Early releases are great as they bring new features faster, but the app might be unstable and thus, the problems might occur. </p>
<p> If you are not sure how to leave the Beta program for Facebook Messenger, make sure to check these steps: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for and open Messenger and scroll down until you reach the You’re a beta tester section. </p>
<p> Tap Leave and wait until you are removed from the Beta program. </p>
<p> Restart your phone and update the Messenger. </p>
<p> 7. Rollback to an older version of Facebook Messenger </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps helped you and Facebook Messenger is still not sending pictures, we suggest using an APK of an older version. With an APK, you can rollback to an older version of Facebook Messenger and address the problem that way. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Uninstall Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror, here, or use any APK aggregator and look for Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> Download the APK. We recommend that the APK is not older than 2 months and that it’s not Beta release. </p>
<p> Run the APK and allow the installation of third-party apps on your device when prompted. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data and then sign in with your credentials. </p>
<p> Alternatively, the server might be down for the time being and you can try sending pictures after a couple of hours. Most of the time, just waiting for the things to sort them selfs out is the best solution. </p>
<p> And, on that note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share your questions or suggestions (alternative solutions) in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<p> Fix: Messenger not showing notifications on Android </p>
<p> Even though Facebook suffered significant drops in the number of active users, Facebook Messenger is still holding up. And it’s still, globally, in the top 5 instant messengers, as many users still cling to it for various reasons. Now, recently, some users reported that Messenger is not showing notifications on their Android devices. If you are among them, find a way to solve this below. </p>
<p> Why am I not getting Facebook Messenger notifications? </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear cache and data from the app </p>
<p> Firstly, you should check the Do not disturb option. Make sure that it is disabled before moving to additional steps on the list. Additionally, if you see notifications but there’s no sound, inspect system sound settings. </p>
<p> If the DND is disabled and notification sound is enabled, you should reset the app. That’s done by clearing cache and data from Messenger. This will log you out of Messenger and address a temporary halt within the app. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to clear cache and data from Facebook Messenger: </p>
<p> Tap All apps (App manager or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Reboot your device, log in to your Messenger account again. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check notification settings </p>
<p> Now, if notifications for a certain app are not coming through, the most important thing is to check notification settings. You’ll need to check both in-app and system notification settings to confirm that notifications are, indeed, enabled on your device for this particular app. </p>
<p> With that in mind, here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> Tap on your profile pic in the top left corner. </p>
<p> Open Notifications & Sounds. </p>
<p> Make sure that notifications and notification previews are enabled. </p>
<p> Now, swipe down the Quick settings and open Settings. </p>
<p> Select Apps and then open All apps (on some devices App manager or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Open Messenger from the list of apps. </p>
<p> Select Notifications. </p>
<p> Now, inspect all options and ensure that notifications are shown along with the sound. Make sure to set all Messenger notifications to High priority. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Make sure the sender is not muted </p>
<p> As you might know, there’s an option to mute notifications for a certain chat or user. You can do so in the app or in the Notification shade. Time options are to mute user/group for 15 minutes, 1 hour, 8 hours, 24 hours, or until you manually turn the notifications back on. </p>
<p> Now, once you mute a user or group chat, you won’t be getting any notifications. Which is why you should ensure that the said user/group/page is not muted. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to check if a certain user is muted on your Facebook Messenger chat: </p>
<p> Open Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> If you see the crossed-out bell icon next to a chat, it means that chat is muted. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on a chat until the menu pops up. </p>
<p> Then tap on the crossed-out bell icon to un-mute the chat. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall Facebook Messenger </p>
<p> Finally, if Facebook Messenger is still not showing notifications on your Android, make sure to reinstall the app. You can also uninstall the Facebook app, just to cover all possible reasons why the Messenger notifications are not coming through. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to reinstall Facebook Messenger on Android: </p>
<p> Navigate again to Settings > Apps > All apps > Messenger. </p>
<p> Uninstall the app and clear cache and data when prompted. </p>
<p> Navigate to Play Store and install the app. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Log in again. </p>
<p> And, with that said, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share your questions or alternative solutions in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<p> Well what I said before eventually didn’t work. It stopped notifying me again. </p>
<p> So I tried this and it seems to work for now: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. Search Optimize battery usage. Click on it. Go down to Messenger and make sure it’s set to NOT Optimize battery usage. </p>

<p> Nothing was useful for me. If I don’t open the app, I don’t know if someone wrote me… </p>
<p> Do you also send messages on Facebook Messenger on your Computer/Tablet? Doing that screws up the notifications on your phone. </p>
<p> I stopped using Facebook Messenger on my Computer/Tablet and did Solution #1 above and for now at least I’m getting notifications like I should when somebody sends me something. </p>

<p> I suddenly stopped receiving messenger notifications on my lock screen. I tried all of these the article suggested and what actually worked at the end for me was to always leave messenger running in the background.So when I clear all my apps from being open in the background, I let messenger always running so I receive notifications on my lock screen. </p>

<p> Fix: Messenger shows unread message on Android </p>
<p> Since Facebook shifted messaging on its platform to the separated stand-alone app, users were not satisfied. A couple of years later, despite ads and whatnot, people grew to like the app. Although, it does have its share of bugs. One common example is linked to Facebook when Messenger shows an unread message on the Android app. Of course, even if there are no unread messages whatsoever. </p>
<p> We made sure to help you address this reoccurring issue. Follow the steps below to find out how to get rid of the undread badge bug for good. </p>
<p> Why does Facebook Messenger show unread messages when there’s none? </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Sign in via a browser to Facebook and open recent messages </p>
<p> This isn’t a permanent solution but it will relieve you of that annoying 1 notification sign whenever you enter Facebook for Android. Namely, this has something to do with the general implementation of Facebook Messenger as a related but separated entity. </p>
<p> The easiest way to clear the notifications from Facebook Messenger showing on Facebook is to log in to Facebook via a browser. Once there, just open Messages and check the grayed ones. Open them and close the browser. </p>
<p> That’s it. Now the Messenger notifications should disappear. Have in mind that you might need to repeat this if the steps below fail to address the issue permanently. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear app’s cache and data </p>
<p> Since there’s no way to log out from Facebook Messenger (ludicrous, I know), the second-best thing is to clear cache and data. That way, you’ll automatically log out of the app while clearing that pesky locally-stored cache that occasionally gets corrupt. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to clear cache and data from Facebook Messenger: </p>
<p> Tap All apps (App manager or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Open Messenger. </p>
<p> Reboot your device, log in to your Messenger account again. Once you open Facebook again, the unread notification badge should be gone. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reinstall Facebook Messenger </p>
<p> Moving on, you should also ensure that you have the latest version of Facebook Messenger installed. That way, certain bugs/temporary issues, should be mitigated. Updating an app on the Play Store is rather simple. However, it’s even better to reinstall the app. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to reinstall Facebook Messenger and remove undread notifications: </p>
<p> Navigate again to Settings > Apps > All apps > Messenger. </p>
<p> Uninstall the app and clear cache and data when prompted. </p>
<p> Navigate to Play Store and install the app. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Log in again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Downgrade Facebook Messenger via an APK </p>
<p> Finally, if not a single aforementioned solution helped you out and Messenger still shows unread message notification on Android, there’s still one more thing you can do. Downgrading apps is impossible with just the Play Store, but it is quite a simple procedure with third-party APK sources. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to download and install an older version of the Messenger: </p>
<p> Uninstall Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror, here, or use any APK aggregator and look for Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> Download the APK. We recommend that the APK is not older than 2 months and that it’s not Beta release. </p>
<p> Run the APK and allow the installation of third-party apps on your device when prompted. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data and then sign in with your credentials. </p>

<p> Fix: Messenger won’t connect to Wi-Fi </p>
<p> Despite Facebook lost a lot of trust and users, Facebook Messenger is still one of the most downloaded instant messaging apps. Recently, some users experienced certain connectivity issues with the app, stating that Messenger won’t connect to Wi-Fi no matter what they do. </p>
<p> Why is Messenger not connecting to the Internet? </p>
<p> If the reason isn’t something on a global scale (you can confirm that, here, on DownDetector), your device is the one to blame. </p>
<p> In case you are not sure what to try when Messenger is not connecting to Wi-Fi, check the 4 steps we provided for you. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check out your network (make sure not to prevent Msg from data limitations) </p>
<p> The “Waiting for network” error obviously points towards connectivity issues first. If you are positive that your wireless network works flawlessly, move to the second step. </p>
<p> But, if you are experiencing issues like prolonged loading of web pages, make sure to check these steps and fix connection issues with Facebook Messenger: </p>
<p> Disconnect and connect again to your wireless network. </p>
<p> Restart your phone/tablet and router or modem. </p>
<p> Disable VPN or proxy temporarily. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Facebook Messenger and, under Restrict data usage, ensure that Wi-Fi and Mobile Data are enabled. </p>
<p> Make sure that no other devices are straining the network. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth or NFC temporarily. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings to factory values. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear cache and data from the app </p>
<p> The next step you should try in case Messenger won’t connect to Wi-Fi is clearing all cache and data from the app. We might be looking at cache corruption, so the best way is to reset the app by clearing all locally-stored files. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to clear cache and data from Facebook Messenger: </p>
<p> Tap All apps (App manager or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Open Messenger. </p>
<p> Reboot your device, log in to your Messenger account again, and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reinstall Messenger </p>
<p> If the previous steps failed to address the problem with the app, we suggest reinstalling Messenger on your device. This will not only clear all locally stored files, but it will also provide you with the latest version of the app. In case you forgot to update it for some reason. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reinstall Facebook Messenger on Android: </p>
<p> Navigate again to Settings > Apps > All apps > Messenger. </p>
<p> Uninstall the app and clear cache and data when prompted. </p>
<p> Navigate to Play Store and install the app. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Log in again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Install an older version of APK </p>
<p> Finally, we can only recommend downgrading the app to an older version by sideloading an APK. Chances are the current version of Facebook Messenger has a flaw that causes issues with Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> If you are unsure how to downgrade Facebook Messenger, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Uninstall Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror, here, or use any APK aggregator and look for Facebook Messenger. </p>
<p> Download the APK. We recommend that the APK is not older than 2 months and that it’s not Beta release. </p>
<p> Run the APK and allow the installation of third-party apps on your device when prompted. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data and then sign in with your credentials. </p>
<p> In the end, you can use Facebook Messenger Lite for the time being, until the problem is addressed by the developer. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi 9 SE common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Xiaomi is a mean smartphone-making machine. They brought to light so many devices recently, with so many variations and product names (a bit confusing naming scheme, to be honest) for all kinds of users. The long list also includes our champion for today, the Mi 9 SE. </p>
<p> The Mi 9 SE is one of 10 phones (ten phones!) in Xiaomi’s Mi 9 branch. It’s a bit watered-down version of their flagship Mi 9, having a smaller form factor, mid-range chipset, and similar triple camera setup on the back. Its main selling points are its size and nice 5.97” Super AMOLED display. It, of course, runs the latest MIUI 11. </p>
<p> Now, we decided to share some love for this compact-sized device and its users and look into reports of Mi 9 SE common issues. In addition, we made sure to, along with problems, provide some solutions, as well. Check them out below. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. The device is bricked after a firmware update </p>
<p> The problem with bootloops or devices getting bricked after an update seems to be bothering more users than it should. </p>
<p> Of course, there are various reasons this might happen on devices with an unlocked bootloader and on custom ROMs but, in this case, the issue appears on the Mi 9 SE with the stock ROM and the locked bootloader. </p>
<p> Namely, users that got themselves the official MIUI 11 on the Mi 9 SE report that their devices got bricked. These are, of course, isolated cases, but there are older reports saying that certain versions of MIUI 10 have caused something similar. </p>
<p> If your device is bricked, there’s only so much you can do. First of all, the chances that you’ll get your data back are minimal. Sadly, EDL access is not allowed so you won’t be able to do much over your PC. </p>
<p> You can try reflashing the stock firmware (find it here) but this will lead to complete data loss. Download the MI Flash tool on your PC and then, by pressing the Power button + Volume Down on the phone, try accessing the fastboot. After that, connect your device and flash the aforementioned firmware. </p>
<p> We recommend contacting your seller that’s, under the warranty, responsible for the device repairs. That’s a better way to go then trying to repair the device on your own. </p>
<p> 2. Ghost touch </p>
<p> Ghost touch issues are not that common on modern AMOLED displays and we can’t be certain if the faulty hardware causes it or MIUI is simply misbehaving. </p>
<p> We heard reports about ghost touch issues being addressed after system update while some users suggested disabling touch-to-wake and MIUI optimization helps. </p>
<p> Firstly, you can try turning off your device and thoroughly cleaning the screen with a cloth. Make sure to apply some pressure (not too much, though) to the display. </p>
<p> Furthermore, you can try with these two software tweaks. Here’s how to disable touch-to-wake first: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Always-on display & Lock screen. </p>
<p> Toggle the “Double tap to wake or turn off screen” option OFF. </p>
<p> And here’s how to disable MIUI Optimization in Developer Settings: </p>
<p> Now, tap 7 times on the MIUI version to enable Developer Options. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings and open Additional settings. </p>
<p> Open Developer options. </p>
<p> Scroll to the bottom and disable MIUI Optimization. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and look for improvements. </p>
<p> 3. Fingerprint issues </p>
<p> The in-screen fingerprint scanner on the Mi 9 SE is sometimes a hit-or-miss experience. Users have had a hard time getting consistency out of it, although it’s unfair to say it’s bad. We assume you are using stock ROM (or MIUI EU ROM) because ported Fingerprint on custom ROMs isn’t all that good. </p>
<p> What can you do to make it consistent, though? The trick lies in applying one fingerprint multiple times to improve the readings. Just add a single finger (fingerprint) multiple times and witness the much better recognition from the in-screen fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the FP scanner won’t work at all, there’s nothing you can do but to either tackle the software (update or downgrade your MIUI version) or contact the seller and ask for repairs. </p>
<p> 4. NFC issues </p>
<p> One of the secondary selling points for this device that placed it in front of others is the presence of NFC. Having an option to pay with your phone is great in supported regions. Have in mind that NFC on rooted custom ROMs is another hit-and-miss and you can’t rely on it. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you are on the stock ROM and still experiencing issues with NFC payments, here’s what you can try: </p>
<p> Reinstall the banking app you are using for NFC payments. </p>
<p> Make sure that your information is properly set. </p>
<p> Try removing a protective case from your device. </p>
<p> Update MIUI. </p>
<p> You can also install an older version of the app, as some users noticed. However, due to security reasons, we don’t recommend installing APKs from untrusted sources when it comes to banking apps. </p>
<p> 5. Mobile Data issues (no mobile data during calls) </p>
<p> GSM Network and consequently Mobile Data issues are not uncommon for European customers with Chinese handsets due to unsupported bands. </p>
<p> Now, global versions usually support a wide array of bands. So, we suspect APN configuration and lack of network coverage to be the main reason for Mobile Data issues. </p>
<p> Alternatively, there are some reports of software-based problems that were, allegedly, addressed after a system update. </p>
<p> So, make sure that your system is up to date. Also, reset APN settings to default values by following these steps: </p>
<p> Choose SIM cards & mobile networks. </p>
<p> Tap on your SIM card. </p>
<p> Tap Access Point Names. </p>
<p> Or you can reset Network settings by following these instructions: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Connection & sharing. </p>
<p> Scroll down and open “Reset WLAN, mobile networks, and Bluetooth“. </p>
<p> Tap Reset settings. </p>
<p> Have in mind that this will erase saved Wi-Fi SSIDs and credentials along with Bluetooth paired devices. </p>
<p> 6. Battery drainage </p>
<p> It was hard to expect such a compact device as the Mi 9 SE to have a large-capacity battery unit. However, the 3070 mAh battery is usually enough to get you through the day. </p>
<p> However, there are reports that the SoT and the overall battery life are lower than expected. And there is noticable battery drainage over night. </p>
<p> Now, in our experience, if something gets broken after MIUI firmware updates, that’s the battery longevity. Thus, we recommend staying put and waiting for the fix on the next update. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can check forums and look for reports about recent updates. Don’t install them if users report battery drainage. </p>
<p> Finally, try these tweaks to significantly expand the battery life on Mi 9 SE: </p>
<p> Disable AoD. Navigate to Settings > Always-on display & Lock screen and disable AoD. </p>
<p> Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Disable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and individually disable Autostart on apps. </p>
<p> Disable NFC if you are not using it in Settings > Connection & sharing. </p>
<p> Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery. </p>
<p> 7. Sound issues on USB-C to 3,5mm dongle </p>
<p> This is quite a common issue on the Mi 9 SE. Since there’s no dedicated headphone jack, Xiaomi provides users with the USB-to-3,5mm dongle. </p>
<p> This dongle is not exactly doing justice to audio output, and even more, it makes crackling sounds for some users while there are reports of it not working at all. </p>
<p> The most common issue occurs when you shift between media sources (e.g. listening to music on Spotify and then opening a Story on Instagram). It just stops playing. </p>
<p> You can try and use Mi Sound Enhancer to enhance or optimize audio output, but that won’t help much if the hardware is underperforming. </p>
<p> Here’s how to use Mi Sound Enhancer on Mi 9 SE: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Sound & vibration. </p>
<p> Scroll down and open Earphones. </p>
<p> Enable Mi Sound Enhancer and choose the type of your headphones. </p>
<p> The best solution is to acquire an alternative dongle (they are not that hard to come by and affordable at that) and use it. </p>
<p> 8. GPS problems </p>
<p> GPS is essential for so many reasons. But reports we ran into are stating that GPS is either not working at all (Searching for GPS prompt appears), is inconsistent, or stops working when users are talking on the phone. </p>
<p> Now, if you are using the Chinese variation of the device, we recommend avoiding the MIUI 11 update for the time being. You can flash (with unlocked bootloader) the Global MIUI 11 version that seemingly doesn’t suffer from GPS issues. </p>
<p> Other than that, there’s not much you can do except using the CIT to determine whether the problem is general or app-related. Here’s how to enter CIT on the Mi 9 SE: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Tap All specs. </p>
<p> Now, tap numerous times on the Kernel version to enable CIT. </p>
<p> Once there, scroll down and select GPS. </p>
<p> If the test shows that GPS isn’t working, the only thing that comes to mind is, as we said, unlocking bootloader and flashing EU or Global ROM on your device. </p>
<p> 9. Display color scheme and over sharpness </p>
<p> Many experts suggest that users should tweak the display as soon they acquire and set up the Mi 9 SE. And if you look at it, you can see why. The colors are, initially, too cold. So switching to the warm color scheme should help. </p>
<p> Alternatively, besides color reproduction, some users are not satisfied with the Super AMOLED text overs sharpness. </p>
<p> This is mostly due to a factory firmware that allows better readability on the direct sunlight. It might be reduced if you choose the Standard instead of the Auto color mode. </p>
<p> You can display colors to your liking by following these steps: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Display. </p>
<p> Open Color scheme. </p>
<p> If you want a warmer color reproduction, choose Warm under the Color temperature. </p>
<p> If you hate the text over sharpness, set Standard under the Colors section. </p>
<p> 10. Tip: How to Wipe Cache Partition and reset Mi 9 SE to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, the only thing remaining to explain is how to wipe cache partition from the Recovery mode (to clear the pilled system cache and hopefully fix certain issues) and reset your device to factory settings. For the latter, please don’t forget to back up your data. The factory reset will delete all files from the internal storage. </p>
<p> Here’s how to access the Recovery mode and wipe cache: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Note: You can perform a factory reset from the Recovery mode as well. It can come in handy if you can’t boot into the system. </p>
<p> And this is how to reset your Mi 9 SE to factory settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this long but, hopefully, helpful read. In case you have additional issues with Mi 9 SE we forgot to mention, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. We’ll do our best to help you out. </p>

<p> Ever since Xiaomi’s first handsets, their custom Android skin, MIUI, has been a hit or miss. In late October of 2019, Xiaomi started pushing MIUI 11, intended to initially stick to Android 9 Pie while Android 10 iterations were expected in the first quarter of 2020. </p>
<p> Some people completely avoid Xiaomi/Redmi devices because of MIUI, others learn to live with it after some tweaking (learning how to debloat MIUI can improve the experience significantly). </p>
<p> And the same hit-or-miss approach can be seen with the latest iteration of MIUI. Xiaomi pilled up features to MIUI 11 which, as a result, brought a lot of issues to their users around the world. </p>
<p> We decided to list common MIUI 11 issues here, the ones we can find online, and share them with you, our readers. Also, we made sure to offer some applicable solutions, too. You can read in-detail about various reported issues below. </p>
<p> 1. Battery drains faster than on MIUI 10 </p>
<p> This is probably the most commonly-reported bug on MIUI 11, no matter what iteration or Android version (Android 9 or Android 10). We read through a bunch of reports about battery drainage from users who updated from MIUI 10 to still-mint MIUI 11. </p>
<p> Now, before we move to some steps that should help you reduce battery drainage, especially when the device is idle (overnight), we must suggest something. </p>
<p> Namely, for this and similar MIUI 11 issues, it’s advised to reset your device to factory settings after you install a major update. Especially if Android versions are different. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reduce battery draining on MIUI 11: </p>
<p> Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Disable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and individually disable Autostart on apps. </p>
<p> Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery. </p>
<p> 2. Battery calibration issues </p>
<p> Even though this issue isn’t exactly ROM-dependant, meaning it doesn’t have to be caused by the transition to MIUI 11, it does appear for some users on MIUI 11 exclusively. What’s exactly the problem? </p>
<p> Well, it seems that the battery percentage is changing erratically. Instead of gradually depleting, users state that battery suddenly drops (e.g. from 70% to 50% in a matter of minutes). This points towards false readings, as the battery is seemingly not calibrated. </p>
<p> Battery calibration is not something hard to do, although it is a process. You can learn how to calibrate your battery with ease by following steps in this article, here. </p>
<p> 3. Picture-in-Picture mode (PiP) issues </p>
<p> There seems to be an issue with PiP mode as well. Based on reports, users who switch to Picture-in-Picture mode (on YouTube, VLC, or other supported apps) and then try to open Recent apps experienced crashes or black screens. It seems that this is, to this day, not fully addressed. </p>
<p> You can try clearing the app’s cache and ensuring that all necessary permissions are granted but, other than that, we can only wait for developers to address this. </p>
<p> Besides that and worth mentioning, it seems that the XS screen setting makes for quite a convoluted mess. You can navigate to Developer options and reduce DPI if you want to set text size and Font weight to XS. </p>
<p> 4. Lags and stutters </p>
<p> Animation lags and small transition UI stutters were somewhat always an issue on MIUI ROMs. Nothing that grave but still noticeable and rather peculiar, especially if we consider hardware capabilities Xiaomi/Redmi devices have these days. </p>
<p> The problem makes overall experience bad as even the most regular transitions on the home screens or opening recent apps is slow. We can safely blame lack of optimization for this, especially on Android 10 versions of MIUI 11. </p>
<p> There are some things that you can do to mitigate this to some extent. An example being lowering the animation scale in Developer options. Not much, as only the developer can resolve the problem fully. Have in mind that Chinese ROM performs worse than the Global one. </p>
<p> 5. Apps crashing or freezing </p>
<p> Another quite a catastrophic issue for those affected. As stated by users on various forums, certain third-party apps (system apps, like App Vault, too) keep crashing on MIUI 11, leading to a crash prompt and/or black screen. This especially appears to be the case when users minimize the app and try to get back to it from the Recent screen. </p>
<p> This is, again, hard to tackle with any troubleshooting step or workaround except with the factory reset. You can reinstall affected apps and give it a go, although we don’t believe this will address the issue. So, back up your data and reset the device to factory settings. If that doesn’t help, wait for updates. Alternatively, you can downgrade to MIUI 10. </p>
<p> 6. Wi-Fi, Mobile Data, and Hotspot issues </p>
<p> MIUI 11 issues with connectivity are not that widespread, although the Hotspot inability to share connection succeded the same issue from MIUI 10. Some users said that the wireless speeds dropped significantly, others that they are unable to utilize mobile data and it even seems that VoLTE (and Wi-Fi Calling, for some) is missing. </p>
<p> Here are some troubleshooting steps to try to resolve connectivity issues, including Wi-Fi, Mobile Data, and Hotspot problems on MIUI 11: </p>
<p> Enable Airplane mode and disable it after a minute. </p>
<p> Reboot your phone and router. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 7. AOD and pulsating notifications issues </p>
<p> Xiaomi made another breakthrough in 2019 by adding more than a few devices with AMOLED displays into their lineup. And what’s an AMOLED-equipped device without Always-on display feature. </p>
<p> Thus, they decided to add AOD to MIUI 11 and, based on reports, they did a good job. Mostly. There are still things to work on, starting from brightness issues and overall usability of AOD on MIUI 11. They are still new to it but things like missing notifications are something users won’t tolerate. </p>
<p> Also, due to a lack of notification LEDs on contemporary devices, Xiaomi implemented pulsating notifications when the screen is off. They are also hit or miss since the brightness is too low for them to be of any use in light conditions. </p>
<p> Again, these are issues on the developer side. Update your device and hope that the next MIUI 11 iteration will address the problem. The community is quite vocal about these shortcomings so we can expect results soon enough. </p>
<p> 8. Dark mode bugs </p>
<p> If there’s one thing that was (and still is) globally trending when it comes to feature additions in Android 10, that’s Dark mode. Xiaomi incorporated it in MIUI 11 with a wider approach than on MIUI 10, making most of the system apps compatible with it. </p>
<p> However, there are some problems with the Dark mode on MIUI 11 for users that upgraded to it from MIUI 10, where it was working as intended. They can’t enable it or, in some instances, disable its scheduling. </p>
<p> And again, it saddens us but the factory reset is your best bet to resolve this. Alternatively, there seems to be a way for rooted devices to enable VoLTE (as explained on XDE, here), but we don’t recommend it if you don’t know your way around unlocking bootloader or rooting. </p>
<p> 9. Camera issues </p>
<p> Camera software seems to be one of the gravest problems on Xiaomi devices packed with capable lenses made by Sony or Samsung. It seems that some nifty additions to the Camera app were not enough to overlook stutters and overall general slow processing speeds, oversaturation, or preposterous audio recording quality. </p>
<p> Some of these are yet to be addressed by Xiaomi while others are minor bugs that should be gone before the official Android 10-based MIUI 11 hits the majority of supported devices. For the time being, try clearing the camera cache. </p>
<p> 10. Game Turbo Mode crashes apps </p>
<p> One of the most advertised MIUI 11 features must be the Game Turbo 2.0 mode that optimizes background processes and provides an overlay with a plethora of interesting options. However, some users experienced issues with third-party apps working in the background while the Turbo Mode was on. </p>
<p> If you are having issues with the Game Turbo mode, we recommend adding affected apps to Memory exceptions and disabling Performance optimization. That should resolve the problem until they tweak the Game Turbo in the upcoming patches. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to disable Performance optimization and add affected apps to the Memory exceptions list: </p>
<p> Open Settings and then Special features. </p>
<p> Open the Game Turbo mode. </p>
<p> Tap on the shield-like icon to open Settings. </p>
<p> Once there, open toggle Performance optimization off. </p>
<p> Then tap on the Memory exceptions and add apps you don’t want to limit while gaming (Facebook and WhatsApp are usually affected). </p>
<p> 11. GPS issues </p>
<p> GPS on Android handsets has such a widespread use these days that many third-party apps depend on it. Luckily, on Android 10, you can limit access to Location Services. However, MIUI 11 seemingly has an issue with third-party apps with GPS readings that are not precise at all. Especially with Google Maps that barely work for some users. </p>
<p> If you are experiencing issues with GPS and Google Maps (or any other Location-dependent app), make sure to enable Assisted GPS and give Location permissions to affected apps. Also, you can test hardware in CIT by typing the *#*#6484#*#* code in the dialer. </p>
<p> 12. Can’t install Netflix from the Play Store and Widevine is L3 </p>
<p> Some users stated that they are unable to download and install Netflix via the Play Store for some reason. If you are using Chinese ROM, Netflix won’t be available for download. You can, of course, download an APK from any APK-aggregating website. </p>
<p> Netflix, like some other streaming services, uses various levels of Widevine DRM to limit the streaming quality to 480p or 720p on certain devices. If you have Widevine L1, you can stream 1080p, while the L3 allows only HD streaming (720p). MIUI 11 Global officially supports L3 but make sure that your bootloader is locked. </p>
<p> 13. Google Assistant won’t start on Mi 9 </p>
<p> Xiaomi’s flagship, Mi 9, comes with the dedicated AI button. This physical button worked great for users on MIUI 10, but it seems it stopped summoning Google Assistant on MIUI 11. </p>
<p> The best way to address this is to update your firmware. That should resolve the problem completely. But, beforehand, make sure to navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Default apps. Once there, ensure that Google’s services are set under the Voice assistant and Assist & voice input settings. </p>
<p> 14. The fingerprint reader is inconsistent </p>
<p> The under-the-display fingerprint readers can be found on more than a few AMOLED devices Xiaomi presented in 2019. Based on the community’s feedback, they are hardly comparable in speeds to back-mounted fingerprint scanners and are not as precise. On the other hand, they are certainly an innovation in the evergrowing market. </p>
<p> Now, it seems that the already lackluster precision and speeds become even worse after an update to MIUI 11. </p>
<p> If that’s the case for you, check these instructions to improve fingerprint readings: </p>
<p> Remove the protective tempered glass (or make sure you are using a supported one). </p>
<p> Add fingerprints for a single finger multiple times. </p>
<p> Remove and add fingerprints again. </p>
<p> Disable always-on fingerprint icon. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 15. Google Pay not working </p>
<p> Google Pay, like the aforementioned Netflix app, has certain security requirements in order to work. Some users stated that adding the card and configuring it is a walk in a park but, for no apparent reason, terminals won’t accept payments with MIUI 11-powered devices. </p>
<p> First of all, make sure to use the HCE wallet option. Alternatively, clear the app’s cache and data to resolve possible issues. </p>
<p> 16. Important troubleshooting steps for MIUI 11 </p>
<p> Enable access to Developer options </p>
<p> Open Settings and then My device. </p>
<p> Select All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number. </p>
<p> Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options. </p>
<p> Scroll down and open “Reset WLAN, mobile networks, and Bluetooth“. </p>
<p> Tap Reset settings. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings </p>
<p> Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> With that said, we can (at least for the time being), conclude this article. Thank you for reading and make sure to add more MIUI 11 bugs or issues we forgot to mention in the comments section below. We’ll make sure to add them to the list and try and help you in solving them. </p>

<p> The Indestructibles: 7 most durable Android phones on the market </p>
<p> We are all aware that monoblock phones are the thing of past. Touchscreen smartphones are the technology peak of this era and they keep advancing every day. Nowadays, they utilize so many features that they are much easier to compare to a PC than to its predecessors. However, there is so much we gained with touchscreen smartphones, but is there something we lost? </p>
<p> Reasonably, it’s quite a short list. But, endurance must be at the top of that list. Everybody heard for the cult surrounding Nokia 3310 and it’s peers. Those ones were simple but sturdy. You could hit the wall with the 3310 and be scared for the wall’s safety. Because the phone would easily prevail. </p>
<p> Yes, we have Gorilla Glass or Saphire but there is so much they can do. Luckily, the manufacturers saw the opportunity and took it one step forward. If you are a bit clumsy or keen to use your handheld device as a multifunctional weapon, we prepared a list of 7 Android phones that proved themselves as a worthy acquisition. </p>
<p> Top 7 indestructible Android smartphones </p>
<p> Samsung emerged as one of the leaders in smartphone manufacturing. They offer both reliable budget phones and high-end flagship devices. But our focus today is less on functionality and more one sturdiness. And Galaxy Active series are at the top of the food chain in those regards. </p>
<p> First on the list is Galaxy S6 Active. The phone was introduced back in the 2015 and it managed to establish itself as a go-to flagship device with remarkable endurance. With Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and all kind of resistance features. Namely, it provides you with resistance to dust, salt, rain, solar radiation and thermal shocks. Additionally, it is water-resistant to 5 ft (1.5 m) and can withstand in water for 30 minutes. Moreover, you won’t need any external protection to preserve it from damage. Even though additional protection can always come in handy. </p>
<p> Except for the obvious sturdiness, this phone is an upgrade over already great Galaxy S6. The battery is amazing (non-removable, sadly). The plastic casing is much better for heat reduction in comparing to a metal casing. If the lack of fingerprint scanner and disputable aesthetics are not a game-breaker for you, this phone is a viable solution for you. At least it won’t crack in your back pocket. </p>
<p> Same as its predecessor, Galaxy S7 Active was presented with better-known S7 and S7 Edge. And just same as S6 Active, it utilizes high-end features with amazing sturdiness. Basically, Samsung just took on the same concept and improved it for customers around the world. </p>
<p> The certified resistance measures stayed the same: you can toss it in 5 ft of water and take it can last up to 30 minutes. Corning Gorilla Screen 4 that has two layers instead of one. That way your phone is, as Samsung claims, much safer from possible screen damage. In addition, it is just as well all other hardy features, like resistance to dust, salt, and other exterior effects. </p>
<p> When it comes to performance, the gap with S7 and S7 Edge is reduced. The fingerprint scanner is available with Samsung Pay addition. The ‘Active’ button, specific for this Samsung series is even better utilized as a shortcut to selected apps. Moreover, the battery is a monster in its class. The drawbacks? Well, it is still larger and heavier than its standard counterparts. And, sadly, it doesn’t support VR. </p>
<p> HTC is well-known for the large specter of well-balanced Android devices. As the case is with all big manufacturers, they also vastly improved resistibility of their phones. HTC Bolt (US) and HTC 10 evo (worldwide) are the synonyms for sturdiness, style, and great performance. Both models were introduced in November of 2016 and they are almost the same. The most noticeable difference is the presence of a 3.5 mm audio jack on Bolt, that is not available on HTC 10 evo. </p>
<p> Both devices are heavily rugged with Corning Gorilla Screen 5 (last generation) and full-metal unibody cases. That makes these phones crash-prove in most of the situations. Additionally, the phones are highly watering resistible. You can place them in the 1-meter deep water for up to 30 minutes. All of the standard protection is there so the dust and exterior effects shouldn’t cause any problems. </p>
<p> Performance-wise this dynamic duo is in the elite league with brilliant, stylish design and amazing screen and camera. In all manners, it is similar to other flagship models. </p>
<p> Motorola Droid Turbo 2 is the device with one of the most resistant displays you can think of. It is practically indestructible and fully shatterproof. Motorola presented this phone back in 2015 and, even though it is not a novelty anymore, it is still a viable option. If not for any other reason, then because of its sturdiness. </p>
<p> As we already mentioned, with this device Motorola implemented special Moto ShatterShield. The display is protected with 5 layers. Every layer has its purpose and all of them work in one favor – to protect your display from any damage. There are multiple tests online with different torture methods. The Droid prevails most of the time, only failing in ultimate tests. Since those are extreme conditions, and uncountable for the everyday use, the phone should do just fine. </p>
<p> Moreover, the screens endurance is not the sole good thing about Droid Turbo 2. The performs well and it is planned for an upgrade to Nougat 7.0. That should tell you enough about its hardware capabilities. Additionally, the 21 MP camera is one of the best in the market. </p>
<p> First 4 phones we listed are quite similar with others in their category. They are just enhanced for better protection. Next phone in our list is not created for everyday use, nor for everyday customers. It is Panasonic’s answer to a narrow but demanding market: specific work surroundings. This phone (or more tablet, on which Panasonic insists) is 3-in-1: </p>
<p> Android-powered smartphone with dual-sim support. </p>
<p> Barcode reader. </p>
<p> Indestructible cold weapon. </p>
<p> Jokes aside, the main use of this amazing device, besides standard smartphone features, is a utilization of well-placed barcode reader. So, its preferred surroundings are warehouses. Nevertheless, since the hardware-wise Toughpad is not remarkable, it’s tough (you would expect that from TOUGHpad) and packs a battery with amazing 6200 mAh. </p>
<p> The phone is covered with the hard rubber casing that will prevent damage from falls or the dust, with water resistance up to 4 meters for 30 minutes. The main difference between this and other similar devices is battery life. Toughpad offers the optional battery with 6200 mAh that can make the phone running for days. But, it is hard to imagine using this phone anywhere but for work. </p>
<p> We will continue in the same manner. Sonim XP7 is another android-powered rugged device worth acquiring for professional use. The phone, as you would expect, isn’t feature packed as some standard smartphones. Sonim is a company known for reliable solutions in ultra-rugged category and XP7 is their latest addition. </p>
<p> What differentiates it from it peers is small size. That makes it much better for everyday use. But, don’t let the size trick you into thinking that XP7 is not hardy. It is as tough as nails. The main protection for the phone is resistant rubber armor and improved Gorilla Glass 2. That makes this phone completely resistant to falls from formidable heights, dust, moderate heat and other hazardous environmental effects. You can run it over with truck and place in 5 ft deep water for 30 minutes. It will work like a charm, regardless. </p>
<p> Even though it is running on stock KitKat 4.4.2, the phone is quite stable with rare bugs that occur from time to time. The distinctive features are an antenna-like speaker that brings amazing sound and battery with great </p>
<p> What is your first association when someone mentions rugged phones for extreme conditions? Ours is Caterpillar. The company that is one of the leaders in creating sturdy heavy machinery and clothes, is more than few years present in technology innovations. And their go-to device must be the latest addition, CAT S60. </p>
<p> With all Android phones, you can find certain similarities but S60 is a category on its own. In the specific niche. Namely, the phone is made to last whatever the conditions. It can last in 16 ft ( 5 meters) deep water for up to an hour. It is completely protected from falling or pressuring. Additionally, the dust, dirt, shock and other hazardous exterior effects can’t touch it. The display is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4. Both main (13 MP) and front (5 MP) camera can be used underwater for both selfies and adventuristic photos of the sea world. </p>
<p> Hardware-wise, S60 is not known for amazing configuration. However, even though the processor is underpowered and the display is not remarkable, it should work out just fine for most of the users. The most distinctive feature of S60 is thermal imaging. This is the first device that implements thermal vision in camera. </p>
<p> This phone is not comparable to most of the Android devices, but it has its specific features and is designed for specific use. To be fair, this device is pricey and you can find affordable phones with better specs. However, if your professional environment demands endurable phone or you are an extreme sports enthusiast, S60 will serve you good. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> This was our list of indestructible phones. You ‘ll see that few of them are for everyday use and others for specific conditions. But all of them share manufacturers idea to give their costumers enhanced protection over standard models. Do you have some additions to our list? Tell us in the comments. </p>

<p> Moto G6 common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Moto G series are the real contenders for the ”best bang for the buck” Android phones. They come in 3 models usually, and that’s the case with the latest iteration, 6th. Besides the Moto G6 and Moto G6 Plus, we also have the more affordable Play version. And, of course, even the quality build and clean Android OS won’t save you from certain isolated issues. </p>
<p> For that reason, we searched for the problems users are experiencing with Moto G6 (Moto G6 Plus and Moto G6 Play included) and provided you with the solutions below. And, at the bottom, you can find the detailed instructions for more complex steps. </p>
<p> Sound issues </p>
<p> Let’s start with the most prominent problem we run into during the research. The sound issues cover all fronts. From the low ringing volume to overall bad audio playback performance and reaching to in-call noise. For some users, the front speaker completely died out, which is almost certainly a hardware issue. In that case, we suggest asking for the replacement. </p>
<p> Here are some solutions we gathered along the way: </p>
<p> Disable absolute volume in Developer options. Open System settings > About phone and tap 7 times on the Build number to unlock Developer options. Once you can access them, toggle “Disable Absolute volume” on. </p>
<p> If the sound issues emerge in video streaming apps (e.g. YouTube), reset the app to factory settings and try again. </p>
<p> Use a medical alcohol and cloth to clear the mic and speaker. After that, you can use a compressed air to remove all debris. </p>
<p> Boot your device in a Safe mode and test the speaker both with media files and in calls. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> Lags and freezing </p>
<p> in spite of more than capable chipset and RAM (for its price range, of course), the Moto G6 users reported lots of freezes, lags, and stutters both during the standard use or while gaming. Taking into consideration that the Moto G series comes with an almost clean iteration of Android, this comes as quite a surprise. However, don’t forget the updates and how they tend to break devices left and right. </p>
<p> We made sure to provide you with some solutions to the problem. Here’s the list of things you can try: </p>
<p> Clear cache from the app which freezes the most. </p>
<p> Disable apps from working in the background. Greenify should serve the purpose. </p>
<p> Update your device for a possible update fix. </p>
<p> Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Clear the cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Display issues </p>
<p> Display issues are not uncommon, as well. Users reported various problems. Some users had a hard time with the unresponsive touchscreen, while others had trouble with the glitchy behavior in some third-party apps. </p>
<p> Uninstall recent third-party apps. </p>
<p> Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> The fingerprint sensor is broken </p>
<p> Certain users had a hard time with the fingerprint sensor. For some of them, it was rather slow in unlocking the device. Others, on the other hand, had a hard time using it in the first place and some of them got the “Fingerprint hardware is not available” message. </p>
<p> These are some solutions you can apply and try and fix it: </p>
<p> Re-configure the fingerprint. </p>
<p> Try booting into Safe mode and, if the fingerprint performs better, uninstall all recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Remove the tempered glass or cases which may cover the fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Clean the fingerprint sensor from a debris and greasy dirt with a wet cloth. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory values. In most occasions, we suggest restoring your device from a backup afterward. In this case, we suggest starting clean. </p>
<p> Of course, if the fingerprint still won’t work, we suggest asking for a replacement. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> A stable wireless connection is a must and that’s exactly what some of the Moto G6 users were lacking. Namely, we found multiple reports about issues concerning connectivity, both with Wi-Fi and Mobile Data network. Either users are unable to connect or the Wi-Fi is turning off and on constantly. These are usually easy to address and a simple restart should work it out. </p>
<p> However, if you’re stuck with the failing Wi-Fi or Mobile Data connections, follow the steps we enlisted below: </p>
<p> Delete all networks and try reconnecting. </p>
<p> Disable Always On for Mobile Data in Developer options. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Reset App preferences. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Network Settings </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Service coverage issues </p>
<p> The Moto G6 series come with the dual-SIM option. However, what’s the use of two SIM cards if you don’t have the network coverage? Allegedly, some users were having a hard time with the network coverage, as one or even both SIM cards had no service network or only emergency service was available. </p>
<p> If you’re not sure what to do in this scenario, some of the below steps might help: </p>
<p> Enable the Airplane mode and disable it after a minute or so. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> Check whether the SIM card is in properly set in the compartment. </p>
<p> Reset SIM card settings. </p>
<p> Battery drains fast </p>
<p> Fast battery drainage is one of the most annoying negatives to the user’s experience. The SoT for the Moto G6 should be around 7-8 hours, depending on your activity. However, lots of users noticed a downgrade to a battery life. The battery started depleting much faster after updates, which is not uncommon. </p>
<p> Here’s the list of possible solutions to resolve the battery drainage issue: </p>
<p> Check the Location services settings for individual apps. </p>
<p> Disable Always On for Mobile Data. </p>
<p> Disable background apps. The update will most likely reset all kinds of your options in regards to background apps. That’s why you need to configure this again. </p>
<p> Update the device firmware. </p>
<p> Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> Camera issues </p>
<p> The problem most manufacturers have is the lack of proper software to meet the hardware. That’s the main reason why Pixel makes great photos and midrange devices passable photos. Well, we expect some updates for the Moto camera, which should improve the photo-taking capabilities of what’s an already great handset. Besides that, there are some minor camera glitches. Even though camera-related problems are scarce, we still decided to put them on the list. </p>
<p> Furthermore, we provided you with some solutions, as well. So make sure to check them out below: </p>
<p> Boot into Safe mode and test the camera. </p>
<p> Clear Camera app’s data. </p>
<p> Update the device. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Phone overheats </p>
<p> What goes for the camera, goes for overheating when it comes to the Moto G6. There are some scarce reports of overheating during charging or while using Wi-Fi or Mobile Hotspot. But, all that falls in the standard behavior. Especially if you’re using the full potential of CPU. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, here are some precautionary measures you can take to reduce overheating: </p>
<p> Don’t use your handset while charging. Or, at least, don’t use it for the CPU-intensive activities. </p>
<p> Remove the casing while charging. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Try an alternative charger if that’s possible. </p>
<p> Moto Voice doesn’t work </p>
<p> As you’re probably aware, the Moto Voice is the integration of a personal assistant in Moto handsets. That way you can choose between Google’s and Motorola finest. However, this option is sadly either unreliable or won’t work for some users. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to try and resolve the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Moto G6 how-to’s </p>
<p> Tap 7 times in succession on the Build number to unlock the Developer options. </p>
<p> Open Developer options in Settings. </p>
<p> Under Networking, disable “Mobile Data always active”. </p>
<p> Safe Mode </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button until the Power menu appears. </p>
<p> Now, press and hold the Power button again until the “Reboot to safe mode” message appears. </p>
<p> Tap OK. </p>
<p> If the device works without restarting for some time, we suggest following the next steps. </p>
<p> Cache partition wipe. </p>
<p> Shut down your handset. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and the Volume Down key until the device starts. </p>
<p> Use Volume keys (Up and Down) to navigate through the menu until you reach Recovery mode. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to choose the Recovery mode. </p>
<p> Once you see the Android with the exclamation mark, press and hold the Power button and, while holding it, single-press the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> Use Volume keys again to navigate through the Recovery menu and highlight ”wipe cache partition”. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to select it and confirm if asked. </p>
<p> The procedure should start and it will last for approximately 10 minutes. </p>
<p> Open Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> The device will restart and all your settings will be restored to default values. </p>
<p> With these general instructions, we can call it a wrap. If you have any alternative issues to share or might be a solution or two, make sure to post them in the comments section below. </p>

<p> So.. in accident I deleted all fingerprints and only meant to do two. Now when I try to register a new fingerprint on settings it won’t let me past “find the sensor on the back of your phone.” Any help? </p>

<p> Phone doesn’t ring or register calls. Have to turn it off and on and then find out I have voicemails from days ago. Tried to do a cache wipe but can’t get to the second screen to select it. The Camera lens has fallen out twice and customer service says it’s user damage (never dropped it) and will cost more than it’s worth to fix. Customer service is horrible. This is my second Moto phone and my last. Company name was sold in 2014 and now produces crap. </p>

<p> For the most part I am happy with this phone for texting and going online. It is of no use when making voice calls though. The sound is horrible, speaker phone is awful. Does not matter who I call, the sound on my end is really bad and if I put it on speaker they complain that it is awful on their end. </p>

<p> I have moto g6. I had screen lock pattern. Suddenly it started not recognising the unlock pattern no matter I enter the correct pattern. I did factory reset now, but the screen is not responding on appropriate click options. I can see visibility settings button, everything works on visibility settings but after coming back on language selection while setting phone after factory reset. Can somebody help me? </p>

<p> After about 2 months of steady use, my mint G6 Play purchased directly from Lenovo/Motorola began to overheat regularly during Rapid Charging. The “CPU Monitor” app reported the CPU jumping from a relatively normal 34C to 38C to as high as 48C in a matter of just a few minutes. I tried an older cable with various Moto and other chargers, and this change did not permit rapid charging. The lock screen reports “charging slowly,” and indeed it does: only about 10% every 30 minutes. This produced an equally rapid drop in CPU temperature, back into the normal range below… Read more » </p>

<p> Sorry, but re booting phone and going thru the steps you listed to remove cache does nothing. Didn’t really clean anything when I did this. </p>

<p> Motorola Moto G7 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Motorola is the champion of the mid-range segment in more than a few countries, especially the USA. And for a good reason. This year, Motorola presented 4 different devices with slightly different quirks and for different price segments. The main device is the Moto G7, followed by the battery-oriented Moto G7 Power, the Moto G7 Play, and the Moto G7 Plus. </p>
<p> Now, these devices are usually sturdy and have a good build, reliable cameras, good battery life, and close-to-stock Android experience. That’s why are they often recommended by various industry professionals. However, they are not without issues. </p>
<p> To help affected Moto G7 users, we decided to collect all major (and minor, too) common issues and present them below. With some applicable solutions, of course. </p>
<p> The majority of these issues and their respective solutions might be present other devices in the G7 lineup, including Moto G7 Plus, Moto G7 Power, or Moto G7 Play. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Night mode keeps changing </p>
<p> The Night mode on Android 9-powered the Moto G7 is a bit limited as it is based on stock Android. It’s not global (for that we need to wait for the Android 10 update), but it does change the appearance in the notification shade. </p>
<p> Some users reported that the Night mode keeps changing on its own. Both ways. From Light to Dark theme and vice versa. If you have that problem, you can force one or another in Developer options. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do it with ease: </p>
<p> Open Developer options from Settings. (explained at the bottom how to enable it). </p>
<p> Navigate to Dark Mode. </p>
<p> Select Always on. </p>
<p> 2. Slow Wi-Fi </p>
<p> Users are not satisfied with the lack of 5 GHz-band support but that’s even a lesser problem. It seems that Wireless is slow for some while there are numerous threads about Access Point issues (especially on the Moto G7 Power). </p>
<p> Here are some things you can do to address Wi-Fi issues: </p>
<p> Boot into safe mode and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth and Mobile Data. </p>
<p> 3. System UI not responding </p>
<p> Certain System UI errors lead to crashes and even system failure and reboot. Some users experienced crashes while on the Home screen, while others had issues in the Settings menu. To make things worse, Motorola Update Services crashed for some during the firmware update. </p>
<p> Here are some ways to fix these rather serious issues on the Moto G7: </p>
<p> Reboot the device. </p>
<p> Limit the number of apps working in the background. You can do so in the Developer options, under the Background process limit. </p>
<p> Lower the Animations in Developer options. </p>
<p> Boot into Safe Mode and, if the device performs better, uninstall recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Reset your Moto G7 to factory settings. </p>
<p> 4. Low in-call and Bluetooth volume </p>
<p> One of the most important things about a cellphone (smart or classic) is calling and receiving calls. And that’s what’s been the problem for more than a few Moto G7 users who experienced muffled and low sound while talking on the phone. This seems to be a long-time issue on these devices and we don’t have any adequate recommendations or fix. </p>
<p> To add injury to insult, the Bluetooth audio output is not all that great as well, being too low even on the maximum setting. For this, there might be a solution and it’s hidden in Developer options. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open Developer options (explained how to enable Developer options at the bottom). </p>
<p> Navigate to Absolute Bluetooth volume. </p>
<p> Disable this option and reboot your device. </p>
<p> 5. Battery drains fast </p>
<p> The Moto G7 is on the lower side when it comes to battery. 3000 mAh is, by all means, not bad. But the 6.2-inch LCD screen is a big enough consumer to deplete it fast. Allegedly, the moderate (tolerable) Screen-on Time went down for some users, as the battery started draining faster than usual. </p>
<p> There are many reasons why that’s the case, so here are some tips to improve battery life on your Moto G7: </p>
<p> Disable background apps. You can use a third-party app to do so. </p>
<p> Make sure your signal is stable. We encourage all our readers to check available bands before purchasing devices. Bad network coverage leads to constant signal-hunting which leads to battery depletion. </p>
<p> Disable Auto-brightness and set preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Disable Location services and Bluetooth when you are not actively using them. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6. Random reboots </p>
<p> Random reboots are never a good sign. These can be caused by various hardware issues, but the system might be the culprit as well. If you are constantly bothered by random reboots on the Moto G7, we suggest resetting the handset to factory settings. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t help, make sure to take your device to responsible service and ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> 7. Can’t move photos and save media to SD card </p>
<p> This is a major Moto G7 issue, based on community reports. Users seemingly can’t move photos and supported apps to the SD card or save media from streaming services. For some, the SD card is accessible but it disappears after they reboot the device. </p>
<p> To fix the SD card issues, the only way is to format it with your device. What you need to do is back up all your data to your PC or internal storage. Once you’ve done that, format the SD card and add it as external storage, not an extension to the internal one. The latter causes issues and leads to SD card corruptions. </p>
<p> 8. The phone can’t connect to car media </p>
<p> Bluetooth connectivity is essential for folks that play their music via the car media (or use navigation) while driving. </p>
<p> That’s why the failing Bluetooth pairing issue on the Moto G7 might be a dealbreaker for some. One recommended solution if you can’t seem to find the car media is to enable the “Show Bluetooth devices without names” in Developer options. </p>
<p> We wrote an article a while ago about phone-to-car media connectivity issues. Check it out here to fix the problem. Just make sure to try it out on other Bluetooth devices. If the issue persists and the Bluetooth won’t work at all, take your device for a repair or replace it. </p>
<p> 9. How to install Gcam on the Moto G7 </p>
<p> This modern smartphone race brought a lot of good for the end-user, as we all got formidable camera setups on mid-range or even low-end devices. However, software optimization is still behind and we can say that many are quite far behind Google (and Huawei, to some extent), when it comes to processing. </p>
<p> The best thing is that there are ports of Google Camera for many devices. This includes the Moto G7. If you were wondering how to install Gcam on the Moto G7, here are the exact steps: </p>
<p> In Google Chrome on your handset, navigate to the Gcam Hub, here, and download one of the versions by tapping on it. The HDR Plus one works great on the Moto G7. Alternatively, try this one. </p>
<p> Allow installation of apps from third-party sources when prompted. </p>
<p> Install Gcam and that’s it. You can tweak some options in Settings to your liking. Enjoy. </p>
<p> 10. Screen colors not calibrated </p>
<p> The issue with colors being off was earlier addressed by tweaking certain Display settings. However, that option is (for no apparent reason), missing from the Moto G7. So, that’s a dead-end. If you are having either extremely cold (blueish) or warm (reddish) color representation, there’s nothing you can do without rooting your device. </p>
<p> You can just confirm that the Night Light is disabled, but don’t hold your hopes high as it depends on the LCD panels Motorola decided to place on their mid-range devices. </p>
<p> 11. GPS and Mobile Data not working </p>
<p> When it comes to reports about Moto G7 issues, we run into a couple of them concerning bad GPS services. For some, there are no satellites available (which is strange), while others have issues with location precision that abysmal on their devices. </p>
<p> Here are some steps you can try to fix this: </p>
<p> Enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning in Location settings. Open Settings > Security & Location > Location > Advanced. </p>
<p> Also, enable the Improve Location accuracy. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Moving on, mobile data is also an issue for some users. This can be rather isolated as it concerns certain carriers, but if your mobile data is slow or your Moto G7 won’t connect, try these troubleshooting steps to fix it: </p>
<p> Enable the Airplane mode and disable it after a minute or so. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Check whether the SIM card is properly set in the compartment. </p>
<p> Reset SIM card settings. </p>
<p> 12. No in-call and media sounds </p>
<p> There’s hardly anything worse than for the device speaker not working at all. Both Moto G7 speakers are not working (down-firing speaker and call speaker) for some users. There are some things you can try and, if they fail, make sure to ask for the replacement since we are probably looking at the hardware issue. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to troubleshoot sound issues on the Moto G7: </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Run diagnostics in the Device Help app. Open Diagnosis > Hardware Test > Receiver and run the test. If it fails, move to the next step. </p>
<p> Try with the Factory reset. </p>
<p> Ask for the replacement, the speaker is probably down. </p>
<p> 13. Ghost touch </p>
<p> Ghost touch is, among some other entries from the list, far from a small bug. Some users reported that the problem with the display prevents them from accessing Settings which is a big issue. </p>
<p> If you have issues with the ghost touch on the Moto G7, try these steps to fix it: </p>
<p> Remove the screen protector. </p>
<p> Clean your screen with a wet cloth and then dry it with the dry one. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 14. Can’t connect to a PC </p>
<p> In case you are not able to connect your Moto G7 to a PC, the problem is probably in drivers. We recommend installing proper drivers and enabling File Transfer when prompted. </p>
<p> If the issue persists and you are unable to connect to a PC, try rebooting the device or switch to an alternative USB port. </p>
<p> 15. Freezing issues </p>
<p> Users also reported freezing and slowdowns on Moto G7, especially when coming out of the sleep idle mode. This is a major issue and some weren’t able to address it even after the factory reset. </p>
<p> If the factory reset won’t help, there’s barely anything else that you can do. </p>
<p> 16. Can’t update or download apps from the Play Store </p>
<p> One user had issues with updating and downloading apps on their Moto G7. The problem lies in the outdated Play Store that, for some reason, won’t update. If you have similar issues, just force update with the latest APK of Google Play Services. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > All apps. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose to show all apps (system apps as well). </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from the Play Store and Google Play Services and reboot your device. </p>
<p> If the issue persists, navigate to any APK aggregate website, like APK Mirror, here. </p>
<p> Download the latest version of Google Play Services. </p>
<p> Run the APK and allow installation from third-party sources. </p>
<p> Install the APK and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Try accessing the Play Store again. </p>
<p> 17. Headphone jack not working </p>
<p> Another problem that some users have with Moto G7 is the inconsistent headphone jack. It seems that it suddenly stops working for some and the audio output goes directly to the main speaker. </p>
<p> If you’ve tried it with different headphones and the problem persists, contact your retailer. The problem is in the hardware. </p>
<p> 18. Netflix and other streaming apps not working </p>
<p> Multiple users reported issues with Netflix and similar streaming services that just won’t work on the wireless network for some reason. It seems that apps load without any issues while on Mobile Data. </p>
<p> If you are stuck with this issue as well, try fixing it with the steps below: </p>
<p> Uninstall Netflix and try installing Netflix APK from here. </p>
<p> Reboot your router and device. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 19. The phone won’t turn on </p>
<p> The worst problem of them all. In case your Moto G7 won’t boot at all (no signs of life), we can recommend nothing but taking it directly for a repair. Obviously, the hardware is failing. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if it just won’t boot the system, you can try and start the device in the Safe Mode from the Recovery menu. The explanation is at the bottom of the article. </p>
<p> 20. The phone vibrating or ringing for no reason </p>
<p> In regards to vibration, this is a feature, believe it or not. It can be disabled with ease and you can do it by navigating to Settings > Apps > Moto > Features > Moto Actions > Flip for Do Not Disturb. Once there, disable Flip for Do Not Disturb. </p>
<p> Ringing for no reason, on the other hand, is usually caused by a rogue app that took a ringtone (longer than the notification ones) as a default notification tone. Check all apps that might have changeable tones to disable it. </p>
<p> 21. Stock camera won’t save location </p>
<p> This is closely related to the GPS issues entry we already covered. It seems that GPS reading and the overall precision of location services on this device are often sub-par. </p>
<p> What you can do is troubleshoot GPS and just disable and re-enable the Save location option in the camera. Also, make sure that the Camera has permission to access Location. Rebooting your device might help, as well. </p>
<p> 22. The phone randomly disconnects while charging </p>
<p> This is probably a factory defect causing the problem so we recommend replacing the cable or replacing the device itself. Of course, this stands if you can confirm that your cable is original 15W Turbo Charger. </p>
<p> Alternatively, before contacting your retailer, we highly suggest resetting your device to factory settings. Although the software bug can rarely cause issues like this. </p>
<p> 23. Mic sound is muffled and low volume in calls </p>
<p> We already covered the problem with the complete absence of sound, but there’s a slightly less serious problem with the in-call sound. Some users stated on the official support forum that the sound during calls is muffled so the other side can barely hear them. </p>
<p> First, make sure that the mic is clean and remove debris and dust. After that, try restarting your device and look for improvements. You should also try and remove the protective case and screen protector, as they might be covering one or both mics on the G7. </p>
<p> 24. Important troubleshooting steps for the Moto G7 </p>
<p> Enter Developer Options </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select System. </p>
<p> Open About phone. </p>
<p> Tap on Build number 7 times. You should get the message informing you that you are now a developer. </p>
<p> Get back to the main menu of Settings and, at the bottom, you should see Developer options, </p>
<p> Boot into Safe Mode </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button to bring out the Power menu. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Power off icon until you are prompted to enter Safe mode. </p>
<p> Tap OK. </p>
<p> To get out of Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Network settings reset. </p>
<p> Choose to reset your Network settings. </p>
<p> Confirm when prompted. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> First, navigate to Settings > System > Backup and back up all your settings and app data. Besides that, make sure to connect your device to a PC and back up all your media. You can also use Google Photos to backup all your photos from the device. You’ll need your Google Account password later. </p>
<p> Once you are certain that everything can be safely deleted, in Settings > System > Advanced, choose Reset options. </p>
<p> Select Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Confirm the selection. Your device will reboot and after some time, you’ll start from scratch. </p>

<p> Moto G8 Plus common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Motorola has a lot of good devices in the best-selling mid-range segment. The latest iteration of their G series is G8, with 4 different versions. Besides G8, G8 Play, and G8 Plus, the battery-oriented G8 Power is expected. Now, the Moto G8 Plus takes the sweet spot with the above-average battery, sturdy build, triple camera setup, and contemporary mid-range chipset. Today, we’ll be talking about common Moto G8 Plus issues and how to solve them. </p>
<p> There are no many issues reported at this time, which is expected for the Moto G series. However, in order to help out those in need, we made sure to list all common issues and provide applicable solutions. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Can’t format SD card as internal storage </p>
<p> Although many OEMs deem external storage unnecessary these days, having an SD card slot is more than useful. Usually, users have a choice between formatting the SD card as standard external storage or as the internal storage. The latter allows for moving some third-party apps. </p>
<p> However, in comparison, to older iterations of Moto G series, the Moto G8 Plus doesn’t support SD card formatting as internal storage. We are not sure about exact reasons but that’s what Motorola decided. </p>
<p> 2. Low volume on headphones </p>
<p> Motorola devices are overall great phones, especially G series that are widely acclaimed in their price range. However, in our experience, while digging for reports about issues, we noticed that overall audio output is not the greatest. </p>
<p> The Moto G8 Plus seems to have two interesting problems, although this might fall to a software bug. Namely, the first problem is quite a low volume even on 100% on headphones. It seems that audio output on the 3.5mm headphone jack is not the greatest in this segment. </p>
<p> Make sure to try with various headphones and, if the issue persists, reboot your device and give it another go. Finally, report the issue to developers and hope they address it in one of the upcoming patches. </p>
<p> 3. High volume on speakers </p>
<p> A complete contrast to the previous headphone bug is the high volume of speakers even in the lowest settings. Everything points towards bad optimization of the maximum and minimum volume on this device. </p>
<p> Just like with the previous problem, there’s only so much you can do. You can try rebooting your device. Eventually, Motorola should address the problem and presenting your feedback should help. </p>
<p> 4. Notification dots don’t work </p>
<p> Google introduced Notification dots on Android 8 Oreo and, since then, they are available on all Android 9 and Android 10 devices. Including the Motorola Moto G8 Plus. This feature allows for small notification dots to appear on Home Screen icons. </p>
<p> However, a few Moto G8 Plus users on Android 9 are unable to make Notifications dots work. Even when they are enabled within Settings. We recommend navigating to Settings > Apps and ensuring that each app has all notifications enabled. Of course, including Notification dots or notification badges. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t work, reboot your device. An alternative workaround is to install a third-party launcher and grant it the system access to Notifications. Many of them allow configuring notification dots (badges) in the same manner the system launcher does. </p>
<p> 5. Battery draining fast </p>
<p> The 4000 mAh battery should be enough to take you through the day. Especially since the chipset on the Moto G8 Plus is more power-efficient than on its predecessors. Nonetheless, the initial longevity was cut short with sudden battery drainage that many users run into. </p>
<p> Besides lower SoT, users report battery depleting fast even when the device is idle and the screen is off. In case you are experiencing issues like this, especially after a monthly update, we have a few ways to help you out. </p>
<p> Here’s how to increase battery life on the Moto G8 Plus: </p>
<p> Disable background apps. You can use a third-party app to do so. </p>
<p> Make sure your signal is stable. We encourage all our readers to check available bands before purchasing devices. Bad network coverage leads to constant signal-hunting which leads to battery depletion. </p>
<p> Disable Auto-brightness and set preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Disable Location services and Bluetooth when you are not actively using them. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6. Random shutdowns </p>
<p> This one of the big Moto G8 Plus issues. It looks like a whole batch of Moto G8 Plus devices has a kernel flaw that causes multiple daily shutdowns. It seemingly occurs when the battery falls under 80%. Now, you can immediately ask for the replacement as many users already did since this affects only a limited number of devices. We recommend that approach. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you want to try and fix it yourself before Motorola addresses it with updates, make sure to follow these steps: </p>
<p> Boot into Safe mode and check for improvements. </p>
<p> Enable Data saver. </p>
<p> Disable Battery optimization. </p>
<p> 7. Bluetooth issues (when Wi-Fi is on) </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues on the Moto G8 Plus, based on reports, mostly occur when both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are enabled at the same time. But that’s not a rule of a thumb. Some users are experiencing frequent disconnecting from paired devices without any obvious reason. </p>
<p> Although, since Wi-Fi also has issues accessing access points when the Bluetooth is enabled so there’s that. For the time being, we can only suggest to keep your device up to date and temporarily stick to one or another (Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) if possible. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can try these steps to resolve the issue with Bluetooth/Wi-Fi interference on the Moto G8 Plus: </p>
<p> Remove pairing and establish it again. Navigate to Settings >Bluetooth and delete all paired devices. Pair the handset with the device again and try again. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Disable Automatic pairing. Pair individually with a device when you want to use it. </p>
<p> Boot into a safe mode and try connecting via Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Update the system. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> 8. Picture-in-picture mode not working </p>
<p> The PiP mode is one of those handy multitasking features that made the media-consuming experience at least slightly better. However, if you want to use Picture-in-Picture with YouTube, you’ll need a premium subscription first. </p>
<p> The majority of other apps should work without any problems. With that in mind, we run into reports stating that PiP is not working on the Moto G8 Plus. </p>
<p> Now, if you have YouTube Premium or Picture-in-Picture doesn’t work on other apps, make sure to follow these steps in order to fix it: </p>
<p> Open Settings. In the Setting Search bar, type Picture and open Picture-in-Picture permissions. Once there, make sure to grant permission to all apps you want to use with PiP. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from the affected apps. </p>
<p> Give Draw over other apps permission to the affected apps. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app that doesn’t work in the PiP mode. </p>
<p> 9. Ghost touch issues </p>
<p> Ghost touch is something no one wants to experience. It’s hard to determine whether the system UI or an app is laggy or the display has a hardware-related issue. </p>
<p> The first thing you can do is boot your device in the Safe mode and check if the problem occurs. If there’s no ghost touch in Safe Mode, we suggest clearing cache and data from the affected apps. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the ghost touch is persistent, make sure to remove the screen protector if you have it on. You can also try resetting the device to factory settings, although we can’t say with certainty that this procedure will help address the ghost touch issues on the Moto G8 Plus. </p>
<p> 10. Bad call quality </p>
<p> This is another serious problem as Moto G8 Plus users reported that the call quality is not all that great. Namely, it seems that the other side can’t hear them all that well, even though they can hear the caller clearly. Now, the first thing to do is to ensure that you have a good network coverage or stable Wi-Fi (for VoIP calls) connection. </p>
<p> There’s not much you can do other than resetting APN settings, removing protective casing if it covers the mic or, eventually, resetting your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 11. Contactless payments not working </p>
<p> NFC payments (Google Pay) are of big importance in the lives of so many Android users around the world. And what’s worse than waiting in line to pay for the purchased goods and the device just won’t connect to a point-of-sale device. </p>
<p> If this happens, the first thing we recommend is removing the protective case, disabling Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Mobile Data (LTE). If that doesn’t help, double-check your credentials in the Google Pay app. Alternatively, reinstall the app and look for improvements. </p>
<p> 12. Common troubleshooting steps for the Moto G8 Plus </p>
<p> Enter Developer Options </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select System. </p>
<p> Open About phone. </p>
<p> Tap on Build number 7 times. You should get the message informing you that you are now a developer. </p>
<p> Get back to the main menu of Settings and, at the bottom, you should see Developer options, </p>
<p> Boot into Safe Mode </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button to bring out the Power menu. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Power off icon until you are prompted to enter Safe mode. </p>
<p> Tap OK. </p>
<p> To get out of Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Network settings reset. </p>
<p> Choose to reset your Network settings. </p>
<p> Confirm when prompted. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> First, navigate to Settings > System > Backup and back up all your settings and app data. Besides that, make sure to connect your device to a PC and back up all your media. You can also use Google Photos to backup all your photos from the device. You’ll need your Google Account password later. </p>
<p> Once you are certain that everything can be safely deleted, in Settings > System > Advanced, choose Reset options. </p>
<p> Select Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Confirm the selection. Your device will reboot and after some time, you’ll start from scratch. </p>
<p> With that said, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and we hope this was a helpful read. If you have additional Moto G8 Plus issues that are not on the list, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. We might be able to provide you with some insight on how to solve them. </p>

<p> RE: 11. Contactless payments not workingThe G8 Plus comes in 2 variants, with the single difference that one is built without NFC (seriously, WTF). I’m also experiencing a really weird issue where the notification sound is muted (get this!) ONLY on the Google Messages app. I’ve tried everything including factory reset, and nothing has rectified this. I’m pretty sure it once worked. I bought the phone new, and after activating it, it downloaded several system upgrades (all in documented in Spanish!). I’m pretty sure one of these caused the problem. I’m currently at Android 9, Build: PPIS29.65-51-5, Kernel 4.14.98-perf+ I’ve… Read more » </p>

<p> Moto G Power common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> We are already accustomed to yearly iterations of Motorola Moto G are fan favorites in the budget segment. Motorola Moto G Power is another version of battery-oriented handsets that we are seeing for a couple of years now and it’s hard to overlook the benefits that a 5000 mAh battery brings to the table. </p>
<p> Now, Motorola likes to run stock Android on their devices, adding an extra layer of quality over some heavily customized and bloatware-ridden OEMs. Nonetheless, it has a variety of small but significant issues. We made sure to look them up and list them below. Along with applicable solutions to help you out. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Bad GPS quality </p>
<p> Based on various reports from multiple support forums and online communities, the GPS seems to be the worst thing about this phone. The signal is lost after some time of use, making the usage of apps like Google Maps or Waze for navigation quite cumbersome. It appears this is resolved by adding Galileo satellites to the list. </p>
<p> In case you are having any issues with GPS readings, you can test GPS with a third-party app just to be sure. If the issue persists, consider giving these steps a try: </p>
<p> Enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning. </p>
<p> Check Location permissions for third-party apps. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 2. Mobile data and call reception issues </p>
<p> Mobile Data issues can render a device completely unusable, based on your usage and preferences. Some users reported that the LTE/4G is incredibly slow and unreliable. And, for some reason, especially when the device is charging. </p>
<p> To add an insult to injury, the device reception is far from being flawless. Users experienced in-call problems caused by bad reception, even in urban areas. </p>
<p> Now, this isn’t an as widespread problem as some others, but there are users who are having a hard time resolving it. If you are among those users, consider resetting APN and, if that fails, make sure to reset the Network Settings. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can try disabling Bluetooth for the time being, as there might be an interference. </p>
<p> 3. Wi-Fi and Hotspot issues </p>
<p> Similar to the aforementioned issues with the mobile reception and mobile data, some Moto G Power users have had a hard time with the Wi-Fi. It seems that the network speeds are subpar for some, while others experience frequent disconnections. </p>
<p> Additionally, the Hotspot doesn’t work for some, which is probably related to mobile data issues mentioned above. In both cases, we can suggest resetting your network settings and temporarily disabling Bluetooth. If that doesn’t help, consider resetting your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 4. No in-call sound </p>
<p> Sound issues on the Moto G series are not as common but, apparently, some users have had a hard time while conversing on the phone. Some reported stutters while others can’t hear the other side at all while being heard without problems. </p>
<p> To some extent, this can be related to network coverage issues but chances are that there’s a hardware issue or a conflict between Bluetooth and cellular antenna. </p>
<p> Try rebooting your device and, if that fails, reset the APN settings. If the issue persists, we suggest taking your device to the retailer or carrier support and asking for the replacement. </p>
<p> 5. Camera issues on the Moto G Power </p>
<p> The camera quality is probably the biggest difference between super-expensive flagship devices and budget devices like Moto G Power. It seems that this handset has quite a capable camera setup but the software side can be rather underwhelming. </p>
<p> Users report slow shutter speeds, loading, camera app crashes, etc. We can suggest navigating to Settings > Apps > Camera and clearing cache and data from the app. Additionally, ensure that you are running the latest firmware. </p>
<p> 6. Moto G Power constantly refreshing apps </p>
<p> There seems to be an issue, at least for some users, which completely made the Moto G Power unusable. Namely, it seems that apps are constantly refreshing and not being kept in RAM, which is hardly the software issue. Especially if we consider that affected users reset the device to factory values. </p>
<p> We recommend taking your device for the replacement or repairs as this is probably a RAM issue at hand. </p>
<p> 7. Bluetooth issues on the Moto G Power </p>
<p> Bluetooth problems are also present for some users. The audio reproduction via Bluetooth when connected to car media is plain awful for some users. </p>
<p> The playback is unreliable and it seems that it doesn’t get much better when connected to other audio devices like speakers or wireless buds/headphones. </p>
<p> If you are among those Moto G Power owners that have Bluetooth issues, check the steps below: </p>
<p> Remove pairing and establish it again. Navigate to Settings >Bluetooth and delete all paired devices. Pair the handset with the device again and try again. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Disable Automatic pairing. Pair individually with a device when you want to use it. </p>
<p> Boot into a safe mode and try connecting via Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Update the system. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> 8. Apps are not updating </p>
<p> Some users reported that certain apps (particularly Chrome for some reason) won’t update. There’s a chance that the locally-stored data might be corrupted so we recommend clearing the cache and data. Follow these steps to do so: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Navigate to the app that’s not updating. </p>
<p> Select Storage. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data. Do the same for the Google Play Store and Google Play Services (tap on the 3-dot menu and choose to Show system apps). </p>
<p> Reboot your device, open the Play Store, and look for improvements. </p>
<p> If that fails, make sure to uninstall updates from the app (Chrome is a system app and can’t be removed), so navigate to Settings > Apps > Chrome and uninstall updates. </p>
<p> 9. SMS messages are not coming through </p>
<p> Again, we can blame the network coverage issues for this, as well. As mentioned above, we recommend resetting your APN in Settings, clearing data from the Messaging app, and rebooting your device. If that doesn’t help, make sure to check your SIM card placement. </p>
<p> In case the issues persist, we suggest resetting your device to factory settings as there’s hardly anything else you can do on your own. Of course, contacting your carrier is not the worst idea. </p>
<p> 10. Slow performance and system lags </p>
<p> Finally, we couldn’t ignore lags and overall underwhelming performance some Moto G Power users experienced. The Snapdragon 665 and Adreno 10 graphics are just not good enough sometimes, especially if you are invested in 3D games like PUBG or Call of Duty. Occasionally, the device might stutter even when you are scrolling through online content. </p>
<p> This is a budget device with the main focus on battery longevity so it’s unrealistic to expect amazing results. However, with that said, there is some way that can help you speed up the Moto G Power significantly. Follow these steps to improve performance: </p>
<p> Reboot the device. </p>
<p> Limit the number of apps working in the background. You can do so in the Developer options, under the Background process limit. </p>
<p> Lower the Animations in Developer options. </p>
<p> Boot into Safe Mode and, if the device performs better, uninstall recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Reset your Moto G Power to factory settings. </p>
<p> 11. Common troubleshooting steps for the Moto G Power </p>
<p> Enter Developer Options </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select System. </p>
<p> Open About phone. </p>
<p> Tap on Build number 7 times. You should get the message informing you that you are now a developer. </p>
<p> Get back to the main menu of Settings and, at the bottom, you should see Developer options. </p>
<p> Boot into Safe Mode </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button to bring out the Power menu. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Power off icon until you are prompted to enter Safe mode. </p>
<p> Tap OK. </p>
<p> To get out of Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Network settings reset. </p>
<p> Choose to reset your Network settings. </p>
<p> Confirm when prompted. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> First, navigate to Settings > System > Backup and back up all your settings and app data. Besides that, make sure to connect your device to a PC and back up all your media. You can also use Google Photos to backup all your photos from the device. You’ll need your Google Account password later. </p>
<p> Once you are certain that everything can be safely deleted, in Settings > System > Advanced, choose Reset options. </p>
<p> Select Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Confirm the selection. Your device will reboot and after some time, you’ll start from scratch. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/motorola-g5-bugs" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844329" filename="motorola-g5-bugs">
<p> Fix: Motorola Moto G5 most common issues and how to resolve them </p>
<p> While the tech world is analyzing and talking about the latest flagships, the mid-budget handsets are arguably neglected. And the newly appointed ruler of this category is Moto G5 and/or its big brother Moto G5 Plus. Moto G5 offers astonishing features for as much as 200 USD while receiving positive insights from both users and tech professionals. Nonetheless, there are some issues you might encounter along the way. </p>
<p> We prepared a list of most-common issues reported by the users themselves, alongside with the proper workarounds. Have in mind that these are individual errors, and we’re still positive that this phone is more than great in many regards. In addition, if you’re even slightly suspicious about the hardware issues, contact your carrier or responsible service right away. </p>
<p> On the other hand, for the software-related issues, check the list below. </p>
<p> Overheating </p>
<p> There are problems and then there are ”problems”. It seems that all of the Motorola-produced handsets after they were taken by Lenovo have had problems with overheating. And, in the long run, this is a ”burning” issue. Joke aside, this is how one user elaborated his experience with the overheating: </p>
<p> ”I bought G5 plus from flipkart. My problem is device is getting hot in normal operations like using internet on wifi. and of couse it get more hotter while gaming… Temperature reaches to 42°C… Is it normal or Should I replace it from the flipkart?’‘ </p>
<p> This is a grave problem and it’s strongly advised to, once you experience massive heat, take some of the following steps. </p>
<p> If the phone is too hot to hold it, you should remove the protective casing. </p>
<p> Also, you can disable some background processes to reduce the overheating. </p>
<p> Make sure that your Moto G5 isn’t exposed to direct sunlight for the extended period of time. </p>
<p> Don’t use your device while charging. Your Moto G5 heats up quickly while turbo charging. Because of that keep your G5 away from the heat sources until it’s charged. </p>
<p> Reduce brightness. </p>
<p> Let the phone cool down for a bit if you’ve played demanding games for some time. </p>
<p> Finally, have in mind that there are security measures that should, once your phone reaches critical temperatures, shut it down in order to prevent the hardware damage. So, at least in that regard, you don’t need to worry. </p>
<p> Dual SIM/ SD card issue </p>
<p> The majority of Dual-SIM android handsets are limited to 2 slots. It’s not the same with Moto G5. You can choose to run two SIM-cards + SD on the Dual-SIM iteration of the model. Moto G5 comes with 16 GB or 32 GB internal storage space, so many users tend to keep the multimedia files on an external SD card and use dual SIM cards. That’s great functionality provided by Moto G5, at least when it works. And that’s, sadly, not always the case. Hear out the complaint one user posted on the official Lenovo forum: </p>
<p> ”When I use dual Sim slots with 2 sim card (my French providers are Orange and SFR), the Moto G5 cannot support the sdcard. 1. SD card with SIM 1 and 2 : only the second SIM is recognized and the SD card works well. 2. one time : SD card with sim slots 1 and 2 : all worked well during few minutes, and after that, android announced that only one sim card works (slot 2), the sim 1 was desactivated. 2. SD card with only SIM 2 : no problem. 3. inserting SD card with SIM 1 : no problem </p>
<p> What should I do ? any idea?” </p>
<p> There are few things you can do if you experience this or similar issues with your Dual-SIM or SIM + SD usage. Follow the instructions below to address them properly: </p>
<p> Power Off your Moto G5 and remove SD and SIM cards from the slot. Clean the slot with the compressed air and re-insert the SD card. </p>
<p> Backup your SD card on your PC and format it. Make sure to format or reformat the SD card on your device and not on the PC. Copy the backed-up content again. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. This procedure is explained below. </p>
<p> If the problem is persistent, there’s a chance that your Motorola Moto G5 is faulty, so make sure to take it for a repair. </p>
<p> Freezing and lag </p>
<p> This may be related to overheating but that’s the worst case scenario. Most of the times, the software is behind the frequent stutters certain users experienced. Those can affect your overall usability and most of the users refer to this as a deal-breaker to quite the capable device. Hardware-wise, G5, as most other mid-budget devices nowadays, should be powerful enough to provide you with the seamless use with octa-core CPU. However, that’s not something that this user reported on the official forum: </p>
<p> ”Right from initial turn on the phone has done ghost typing. In fact no sooner had I left a less than pleased message on Amazon than the thing did yet another a five second burst of ghost typing. It also freezes periodically for at least five to ten second and/or until the screen is cycled on and off. Today it cleared the screen mid-conversation to wipe out a phone call. Have flushed system cache and disabled permission for very non-Google app that tries to go near system settings. But this is not an app problem, it is coming from somewhere inside of Andriod and/or the hardware. Couple this with a lousy camera for this class of phone and the user experience has been worthy of United Airlines. Despite the hype, has Lenovo laid a great big turkey egg?” </p>
<p> Even though this is probably an isolated case, there are more reports of the similar underwhelming performance drops. Luckily, if it’s not hardware but rather a software, there are a few workarounds that should help you resolve the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Restart your Moto G5. </p>
<p> Boot in the safe mode and look for changes. The procedure will be explained below. </p>
<p> Check the temperature. Optimal handset temperature is 35 degrees. </p>
<p> If a specific app is lagging, make sure to clear cache and restart the app. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Even the properly functioning hardware isn’t enough if you’re having software issues. There seems to be a bug that affects wireless, which results in constant disconnections and loss of signal. Moreover, even after some updates provided by carriers or Lenovo themselves sorted things out, there are still users with connectivity issues. This is what one of them reported on the official Lenovo community forum: </p>
<p> ”Hi, </p>
<p> My wifi disconnects automatically even signal is high and connects after sometime. The wifi range is also very less compared to my old phone. Please help me with the issue ASAP. </p>
<p> Thanks in advance.” </p>
<p> Since this is a bug, it should be resolved by the manufacturer. But, for the time being, we advise you to take these actions and we’ll probably get into clear: </p>
<p> Forget the network and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart your modem or router. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi scanning. </p>
<p> Make sure to use 2.4 GHz over 5 GHz frequency or vice versa and look for changes. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. The procedure is explained below. </p>
<p> Poor video quality and in-video background noise </p>
<p> This was a grave problem since the introduction. Lenovo managed to resolve it to some extent with the patch, but some users are still experiencing strange noise in the background. Besides that, video recording quality is far from expected, especially when we take into consideration moderate main camera which isn’t rubbish and can record 4K videos. </p>
<p> ”Insanely pathetic background noise in audio captured via mic while recording videos. Many many users are facing this issue now. Feeling cheated by Moto. I am pretty sure now Lenovo makes a few flawless devices for top reviewers and then use their reviews to dupe customers who trust the reviews. Even cheap android phones handle noise cancellation better than this awful device’s mic.” </p>
<p> Firstly, make sure to install available updates. There’s a chance that they’ll relieve you of the issue at hand. Moreover, you can give a try to these workarounds: </p>
<p> Restore camera settings to default. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Boot in safe mode and try using the camera. </p>
<p> Use an alternative camera app from the Play Store until Lenovo addresses this issue. </p>
<p> VoLTE issues </p>
<p> VoLTE or Voice over LTE is a great feature that many users gladly turn to. However, there are multiple reports on the web that Moto G5 and VoLTE are not exactly on the right terms. Allegedly, even though both the device and network provider are supporting VoLTE, users were even unable to locate the exact settings to enable it. We brought to you an explanation of the problem we found on the Lenovo’s official forum: </p>
<p> ”Hi, I got my Moto G5 plus (Indian edition) today. When I put my Reliance Jio sim in it, it fails to make calls using VoLTE. There is no option to enable VoLTE. When I try to manually enable it using [ removed ] menu, the VoLTE Provisioned flag turns off automatically. Please Help” </p>
<p> There are some workarounds you can try, but, most of the time, the best solution is to contact your carrier. </p>
<p> Switch SIM card position. </p>
<p> Restart Network settings. </p>
<p> Set preferred network to 4G. </p>
<p> Make sure you have acceptable network coverage. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. Look below for the explanation of this procedure. </p>
<p> Make sure to contact your carrier if nothing worked. </p>
<p> Launcher3 crash </p>
<p> The ”Launcher3 isn’t responding” is an emerging error that’s somewhat connected to an underwhelming Android optimization on this device, or rather Moto UI interference with the Google apps. Certain Google pre-installed apps and features provoke an error on G5, especially Google Now. Lately, updates fixed this error for some users, while the others are still forced to cope with it. This is how one user described this strange occurrence on a forum: </p>
<p> ”In Moto G5 Plus I swipe to the right from the home screen and goto the Google now page and open the news feed to read the news. When I come back to the Google now page it stops responding and then I get the message “Launcher3 isn’t responding”with two options “ Close app or Wait”. This happens repeatedly every time when I come back to the Google now page after reading the different news feeds. If I goto multiple news feeds (sometimes 3 or more) from the Google now page, the phone restarts automatically. Can you please provide solution for this issue.” </p>
<p> There are some temporary workarounds that should help you resolve the issue for some time. For the ultimate solution, you’ll probably need to perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps and locate Launcher3. Clear cache and data. Restart your device and look for changes. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings. </p>
<p> How to perform a factory reset, safe boot and wiping of the cache partition on Moto G5 </p>
<p> Safe boot </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button to bring the shutdown pop-up screen. </p>
<p> Touch and hold ”Power Off” until you’re prompted with the ”Reboot to safe mode” message. </p>
<p> Tap OK to confirm. </p>
<p> After reboot, your device will start in Safe mode. </p>
<p> Make sure to check previously installed applications that might have been causing the issue you’re trying to address. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Shut down your handset. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and the Volume Down key until the device starts. </p>
<p> Use Volume keys (Up and Down) to navigate through the menu until you reach Recovery mode. </p>
<p> Press Power button to choose the Recovery mode. </p>
<p> Once you see the Android with the exclamation mark, press and hold the Power button and, while holding it, single-press the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> Use Volume keys again to navigate through the Recovery menu and highlight ”wipe cache partition”. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to select it and confirm if asked. </p>
<p> The procedure should start and it will last for approximately 10 minutes. </p>
<p> Open Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> The device will restart and all your settings will be restored to default values. </p>
<p> That should do it. If you have alternative solutions or more problems we can add to this list, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. We’ll be glad to help if we can. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Motorola Moto Z4 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Motorola upped their game when it comes to mid-range devices with addition to their Z class. The Moto Z4 comes with a 6.4-inch OLED screen, 4 GB of RAM, and interesting support for Moto Mods packed in close-to-stock Android package. This is, by all means, a good but not a flawless device. Some Moto Z4 users reported issues online. </p>
<p> These are reported issues mostly minor bugs caused by the lack of optimization. In order to help our readers out, we made sure to bring out the most common bugs and a few recommended solutions. Check them out below. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Wi-Fi connection issues </p>
<p> Some users report that, after they installed a regular monthly patch, Wi-Fi just stopped working. Others have issues with stability as the device connection frequently drops. These are not as prominent as some other issues but there are a few reports. </p>
<p> In case you run into some Wi-Fi issues on your Motorola Moto Z4, make sure to try these steps: </p>
<p> Boot into safe mode and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth and Mobile Data. </p>
<p> 2. Battery draining </p>
<p> Battery draining is never welcome, especially when the device is idle. More than a few users run into problems with battery drainage. There are multiple things you can try to reduce battery draining on the Moto Z4. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to improve your battery life on the Moto Z4: </p>
<p> Disable background apps. You can use a third-party app to do so. </p>
<p> Make sure your signal is stable. We encourage all our readers to check available bands before purchasing devices. Bad network coverage leads to constant signal-hunting which leads to battery depletion. </p>
<p> Disable Auto-brightness and set preferred brightness manually. </p>
<p> Disable Location services and Bluetooth when you are not actively using them. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 3. Apps crashing </p>
<p> This is a major issue but, luckily, it’s not as prominent as some other issues on this list. If your apps are crashing, be that preinstalled system apps or third-party apps you got from the Play Store, we have a few things to recommend. </p>
<p> Here’s how to fix Moto Z4 issues with app crashing: </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from the affected apps. </p>
<p> Boot into Safe mode and check whether the issue occurs again. </p>
<p> Reinstall affected apps. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 4. NFC won’t turn off </p>
<p> This device, like almost all Motorola mid-rangers, supports NFC technology. As time progress, this hardware feature is one of the more important ones for a variety of reasons. </p>
<p> However, you probably don’t want it enabled all the time as it tends to deplete the battery a lot. This brings us to a problem one Moto Z4 user reported, stating that he’s unable to turn off NFC on their device. And then, when they finally, after a couple of reboots, managed to turn NFC off, it wouldn’t turn back on. </p>
<p> What we recommend is to clear the cache and data from the NFC app or, if the issue persists, reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 5. Poor cellular signal </p>
<p> This seems to be a major problem based on reports we run into online. Of course, there are multiple factors that might lead to poor cellular signal. However, there’s obviously a reoccurring problem concerning bad network reception on the Moto Z4. </p>
<p> Due to SoC limitations, there’s not much you can do except to try and disable additional features like Bluetooth and NFC when not using them. Also, you can try and reset APN settings while waiting for updates that will, helpfully, at least slightly improve the cellular signal. </p>
<p> 6. Moto Z4 overheating </p>
<p> Overheating is one of those things that might be detrimental to your device hardware but temperatures rarely reach dangerous temperatures. Nonetheless, it’s important to keep track of it, especially if your Moto Z4 is hot on touch when idle. </p>
<p> For the time being, try these steps to ensure that your device doesn’t overheat too much: </p>
<p> Don’t use your handset while charging. Or, at least, don’t use it for the CPU-intensive activities. </p>
<p> Remove the casing while charging. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Try an alternative charger if that’s possible. </p>
<p> 7. Speakers output with static noises </p>
<p> Audio output is definitely not the strongest side of the Moto Z4. It seems that both speakers (bottom main and call speaker) are underperforming. The problem differs, but static noises seem to be quite prominent. It occurs both during calls or playing audio on your device. </p>
<p> There’s hardly anything we can suggest except to reset your device to factory settings. If that doesn’t help, we highly recommend asking for the replacement as the device’s hardware is definitely flawed. </p>
<p> 8. Xbox controller doesn’t work with Moto Z4 </p>
<p> Users that like to use their Xbox controllers via OTG to play games on the Moto Z4 had a hard time making them work. However, it looks like Motorola resolved this issue with a certain patch. </p>
<p> So, in case you are unable to utilize your wired Xbox controller, just update the OS and the problem should be gone. </p>
<p> 9. Touchscreen issues </p>
<p> Ghost touch issues are not frequent but they did occur for some Moto Z4 users. The issue seems to manifests in a variety of ways, especially repetitive screen freezing while tapping or scrolling, or under-the-display fingerprint sensor issues. </p>
<p> Try removing your SIM card and rebooting your device. Also, we highly recommend removing the screen protector from your device. Finally, if nothing helps reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 10. Moto Z4 mods don’t fit </p>
<p> This is regularly discussed on various public forums and many users don’t like the way Moto Mods fit on the Moto Z4, as they are sticking on both sides. This applies to Moto Style Shells, as well. </p>
<p> We assure you that, based on official reports, this was an intentional design in order to make removal and placement of the said accessories. </p>
<p> 11. Screen stays black after calls </p>
<p> In case you are experiencing issues like this, there are two things we can recommend. Either there’s something wrong with your Call app, so you should clear the cache and data from it. Or, on the other hand, the issue is hardware-related and the screen protector is probably covering sensors. </p>
<p> So, make sure to remove the screen protector or, if you are determined to use one, check what official screen protectors are supported by the Moto Z4. </p>
<p> 12. Hotspot not working </p>
<p> This is, based on our research, strictly a carrier issue and not the problem caused by Motorola. In order to troubleshoot it, try using an alternative SIM card and test it that way. In case the Hotspot is working as intended, make sure to contact your carrier. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t work, you can reset your network settings or, eventually, reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 13. No audio except on headphones </p>
<p> We already mentioned that this exact device, based on reports, doesn’t shine when it comes to audio output. If you are experiencing Moto Z4 issues with the sound output and there’s no sound at all no matter what you do, the only thing we can recommend is resetting your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t help, use your warranty to ask for the replacement as the issue is definitely hardware-related. </p>
<p> 14. GPS not working </p>
<p> Another problem that’s frequently reported is related to GPS as some system (and third-party) apps are not updating location. If you are affected by this, make sure you don’t have any aluminum protective casing on. Those tend to meddle with GPS and location services. </p>
<p> If you don’t have a protective casing, make sure all options are enabled in Location services and reset the device to factory settings if the issue persists. </p>
<p> 15. Google Lens or Assistant not working properly </p>
<p> Some Moto Z4 users have had a hard time with certain Google services, like Google Lens or Google Assistant. In order to resolve these, we suggest clearing the cache and data from the Lens and Google apps. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t help, reinstall those apps, reboot your device, and give it another try. </p>
<p> 16. Peek display not working </p>
<p> The Peek display (Ambient display on supported Moto devices) is quite nifty when you have an OLED display. Sadly, some users experienced issues with Peek display as the feature is inconsistent. It works and then, for no apparent reason, stops appearing. </p>
<p> The recommended solution we run into is to clear the app cache and data from the Peek display app. Just navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps and clear cache and data from the app. Reboot your phone and look for improvements. </p>
<p> 17. Lags and stutters when gaming and in UI </p>
<p> Snapdragon 675 (with Adreno 612) is a quite good mid-range chipset, more than capable to run most games (at least on medium settings). However, it seems that some users are experiencing stutters when playing even undemanding games. In addition, system UI stutters are not unusual, as well. </p>
<p> Here are some steps to take in order to reduce lags on the Moto Z4: </p>
<p> Reboot the device. </p>
<p> Limit the number of apps working in the background. You can do so in the Developer options, under the Background process limit. </p>
<p> Lower the Animations in Developer options. </p>
<p> Boot into Safe Mode and, if the device performs better, uninstall recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Reset your Moto G7 to factory settings. </p>
<p> 18. Common troubleshooting steps for Moto Z4 </p>
<p> Enter Developer Options </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select System. </p>
<p> Open About phone. </p>
<p> Tap on Build number 7 times. You should get the message informing you that you are now a developer. </p>
<p> Get back to the main menu of Settings and, at the bottom, you should see Developer options, </p>
<p> Boot into Safe Mode </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button to bring out the Power menu. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Power off icon until you are prompted to enter Safe mode. </p>
<p> Tap OK. </p>
<p> To get out of Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Network settings reset. </p>
<p> Choose to reset your Network settings. </p>
<p> Confirm when prompted. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> First, navigate to Settings > System > Backup and back up all your settings and app data. Besides that, make sure to connect your device to a PC and back up all your media. You can also use Google Photos to backup all your photos from the device. You’ll need your Google Account password later. </p>
<p> Once you are certain that everything can be safely deleted, in Settings > System > Advanced, choose Reset options. </p>
<p> Select Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Confirm the selection. Your device will reboot and after some time, you’ll start from scratch. </p>
<p> And, on that note, we can wrap it up. Thank you for reading and we hope this article shed some light on the most frequent Moto Z4 issues. In case you have any more bugs or problems to add to our list, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. We look forward to helping you out as best as we can. </p>

<p> Im having an issue with this phone, everytime I share something, the phone tell that its being shared and it takes over a minute for it to disappear. How can I remove it or make it disappear faster. My phone is Moto Z 4 </p>
<p> Same problem: call duration, deleted messages,shared,,all these messages stay on my screen for about a minute. How do I fix this? </p>
<p> I just switched out a new Z4 because of a multitude of problems! I have been with Motorola for many years, but this will be my last. Making and receiving calls on the first device was a nightmare. It would go to the white screen while next to my face. Sound quality was so poor that folks couldn’t hear me. Video calling would turn itself on. My Messaging Plus would not receive some messages. Messages would disappear from my logs, and then mysteriously reappear. While going into web pages, other web pages would pop up on their own. And I… Read more » </p>

<p> On my old Moto Droid II I could move the Hot Spot to my home page with other apps. On this new Moto Z4, i cannot get the icon to move off of the second page, where it’s pretty useless to me. Any ideas? TY </p>

<p> I’m expecting a surprising number of these. Crappy internet, battery drain, high heat, ghost touch, black screen. I loved the Turbo and the Force2, hate this Z4. I think no more Motorola purchases in the future. </p>
<p> I am experiencing the same thing. Have to restart my phone all the time to get any signal. </p>

<p> I have been having the same issue with Bluetooth since latest update on 6/2/20. Any fixes in store yet? </p>
<p> The issue has been fixed in a recent patch, they also seem to have improved the peek app with this update so it might be a little more consistent. </p>

<p> Every issue addressed except Bluetooth connectivity issues. Ever since update mine keeps cutting out </p>
<p> Audio issues with Bluetooth have been resolved with the most recent patch, check for an update </p>
<p> My New z4 does not update the calendar date on the home page. Reset phone from scratch, got a replacement. Still doesn’t work. No more Motorola phones for me! </p>

<p> Moto X4 common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> When the Google-powered Nexus series was discontinued, the Android One took over with some rather competitive handsets from different OEMs. Like, Motorola (Lenovo) Moto X4 for example. However, it seems that updates (even though they come on time) still come unfinished and a plethora of issues plagued Moto X4 users. </p>
<p> Judging from online reports, they come in numbers. That’s why we enlisted them below and provided you with some applicable solutions. Make sure to try them out before turning your device to service. </p>
<p> Table of contents: </p>
<p> Lags and freezes </p>
<p> From the get-go, we’ll try and provide some solutions for occasional lags and freezes. These, like many other errors, mostly started occurring after the upgrade to Oreo 8.0. and 8.1. It seems that even the Android One devices are subjective to software-inflicted issues. </p>
<p> We explained 3 major troubleshooting steps (Factory reset, App preferences reset, and Wipe cache partition) in this section, so if you see a suggestion in some other issues, get back here and follow the steps. Also, images we provided are from another device, so the settings and paths might differ slightly. </p>
<p> Here are some steps you can take to fix lags and freezes when using Moto X4: </p>
<p> Clear cache from the app which freezes the most. </p>
<p> Disable apps from working in the background. Greenify should serve the purpose. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and the Volume Down key until the device starts. </p>
<p> Use Volume keys (Up and Down) to navigate through the menu until you reach Recovery mode. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to choose the Recovery mode. </p>
<p> Once you see the Android with the exclamation mark, press and hold the Power button and, while holding it, single-press the Volume Down key. </p>
<p> Use Volume keys again to navigate through the Recovery menu and highlight ”wipe cache partition”. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to select it and confirm if asked. </p>
<p> The procedure should start and it will last for approximately 10 minutes. </p>
<p> Open Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> The device will restart and all your settings will be restored to default values. </p>
<p> Sudden restarts </p>
<p> In comparison to almost all other enlisted issues, this must be the worst. This, like almost all others, also started occurring after a major update to Oreo 8 or 8.1. The affected users stated that the error is hardly connected to a single app, as the phone reboots randomly without any obvious reason. </p>
<p> You can try these steps to resolve the issue: </p>
<p> Boot the phone in Safe Mode and look for changes. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button until the Power menu appears. </p>
<p> Now, press and hold the Power button again until the “Reboot to safe mode” message appears. </p>
<p> Tap OK. </p>
<p> If the device works without restarting for some time, we suggest following the next steps. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition data. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Battery depleting fast </p>
<p> Since the Moto X4 packs a smaller LCD display and Snapdragon 630, the battery life and SoT are rather good. However, that changed with over time. Some user’s reports state that the battery life almost halved after the update. </p>
<p> Here are some things you can try out and, at least slightly, improve the battery life on Moto X4: </p>
<p> Check the Location services settings for individual apps. </p>
<p> Disable Always On for Mobile Data. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap About phone. </p>
<p> Tap 7 times in succession on the Build number to unlock the Developer options. </p>
<p> Open Developer options in Settings. </p>
<p> Under Networking, disable “Mobile Data always active”. </p>
<p> Disable background apps. The update will most likely reset all kinds of your options in regards to background apps. That’s why you need to configure this again. </p>
<p> Update the device firmware. </p>
<p> Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> Overheating </p>
<p> The overheating isn’t a common issue as some other indeed are, but it’s still present. And the problem with overheating is that, over the extended time of abnormally high temperatures, chances that the hardware will go faulty substantially rise. </p>
<p> That’s why you need to deal with it and here are some steps which should help: </p>
<p> Don’t use your handset while charging. Moto X4 has the Turbo Charging option and, besides a faster charging, it often can get your phone quite hot. </p>
<p> Remove the casing while charging. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Try an alternative charger if that’s possible. </p>
<p> Underperforming fingerprint scanner </p>
<p> Now, if the overheating isn’t as common, the issues with the fingerprint scanner spread like a plague. Lots of users experienced slow or even unresponsive fingerprint reader after the update. This is the go-to biometric security on the phone, and we perfectly understand why the protests concerning the fingerprint scanner are quite harsh. </p>
<p> But, don’t worry. Follow these steps to try and address the fingerprint scanner issues on Moto X4 after the update: </p>
<p> Re-configure the fingerprint. </p>
<p> Try booting into Safe mode and, if the fingerprint performs better, uninstall all recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Remove the tempered glass or cases which may cover the fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Clean the fingerprint sensor from a debris and greasy dirt with a wet cloth. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory values. In most occasions, we suggest restoring your device from a backup afterward. In this case, we suggest starting clean. </p>
<p> In-call and general sound issues </p>
<p> Both in-call sound and speaker sound get a lot lower and the affected users can barely hear anything. Even though there’s a slight chance of hardware malfunction, a variety of issues emerged just after an update. </p>
<p> Some of them include even the mic, as some users were able to hear everything but the other side couldn’t. Which points towards a system bug. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to try and resolve the sound issues on Moto X4: </p>
<p> Disable absolute volume in Developer options. We explained how to enable Developer options above. Once you can access it, toggle “Disable Absolute volume” on. </p>
<p> If the sound issues emerge in video streaming apps (e.g. YouTube), reset the app to factory settings and try again. </p>
<p> Use a medical alcohol and cloth to clear the mic and speaker. After that, you can use a compressed air to remove all debris. </p>
<p> Boot your device in a Safe mode and test the speaker both with media files and in calls. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> Bluetooth pairing fails </p>
<p> The majority of reported Bluetooth issues (at least the ones we were able to get the hold of) are related to pairing with the car system. This doesn’t mean that certain users had a hard time connecting to different devices. Bluetooth is either disconnecting randomly or won’t connect at all. </p>
<p> If you’re troubled by Bluetooth issues, make sure to try out the steps we enlisted below: </p>
<p> Remove pairing and establish it again. Navigate to Settings >Bluetooth and delete all paired devices. Pair the handset with the device again and try again. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Disable Automatic pairing. Pair individually with a device when you want to use it. </p>
<p> Boot into a safe mode and try connecting via Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Update the system. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Connection-wise, Bluetooth is not the only one which needs fixing, apparently. Even the Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues are quite present, with the similar symptoms. Either the connection cracks midway or the handset isn’t able to connect. </p>
<p> Here are some steps you can try out and look for improvements in the network department: </p>
<p> Delete all networks and try reconnecting. </p>
<p> Disable Always On for Mobile Data in Developer options. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Reset App preferences. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Network Settings </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Alexa won’t work </p>
<p> One of the advantages for this handset is the presence of Assistant choice. On Moto X4, besides the obvious Google Assistant, you can use Alexa as well. This, of course, applies to certain countries, but it’s a valid option. Now, even though this is somewhat an exclusive for this device, user reports state that they weren’t able to use Alexa as, supposedly, the Amazon’s assistant had issues integrating with the device. </p>
<p> We roamed around and found a few solutions you can try to address this: </p>
<p> Make sure the Moto Alexa app is working in the background. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Settings > Special access. Under “Ignore battery optimization” toggle Moto Alexa on. </p>
<p> Clear the app’s cache. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Moto Alexa > Storage. Tap Clear cache. </p>
<p> Check the app’s permissions. It needs the mic access, so make sure it’s still enabled after an update. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app. </p>
<p> Google Play Services crashing </p>
<p> Google Play Services is the core of the Android platform. Basically, it connects all installed applications and makes sure that everything works as intended. </p>
<p> Now, one would assume that the stock Android experience on Moto X4 won’t have any issues with the OS itself. Sadly, that’s not the case for some users, as they frequently experienced Google Play Services crashing. </p>
<p> If you’re not sure about the applicable troubleshooting steps, follow the ones below: </p>
<p> Update your device. </p>
<p> The device is not shown when connected to a PC </p>
<p> Yet another quite disruptive problem for all users. Namely, since the system update to Android Oreo 8.1, more than a few users weren’t able to access the phone from a PC via USB. Allegedly, the device is charging but neither MTP nor ADB modes are available. </p>
<p> We have some suggestions to get this work, so give them a try: </p>
<p> Open Developer options. Choose the “Select USB Configuration”. From the list, choose the MTP (Media Transfer Protocol). </p>
<p> Install Motorola suite for the PC. It provides certain drivers so it might help PC recognizing the phone. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Update your device. </p>
<p> Restart the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Dialer and Camera apps crashing </p>
<p> Both Dialer and Camera crashes are quite common, but only the Dialer app causes the blue screen freeze where you can’t basically do nothing but forcibly turn off your device. This is a grave issue, but it’s apparently addressed in one of the recent patches. </p>
<p> Either way, if you’re still experiencing app crashes, follow the steps we provided below: </p>
<p> Restart into Safe mode and try calling or taking a photo. If everything works fine, remove all recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Clear apps cache. </p>
<p> Reset apps preferences. </p>
<p> Restore apps to factory values. Open Settings > Apps. Choose both Camera and Dialer and tap Disable. You should be prompted to restore the app. You can update it later on. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> Don’t forget your warranty and ask for a replacement if the issue is persistent and the software fixes are not applicable. </p>
<p> This was our in-depth list of the most common Moto X4 issues. If there’s an additional problem you care to share or questions regarding the ones we enlisted, feel free to do so. The comments section is there for a reason. </p>

<p> The usual nonsense: try random things, to see if something sticks. If not, do a factory reset – never mind that you might lose data or devote long hours to reconfigure your phone as it originally was. What a piece of crap. And, no, this is not from an iSheep – Apple phones are just more expensive, not better. It is just that he smartphone software industry is able to come up with systems that sort of work, and when they fail, nobody ever has a clue as to how or why. </p>

<p> How to move Google contacts from Android to iPhone </p>
<p> So you just got your new, I even assume the first-ever, iPhone. You’re overwhelmed with excitement that you would normally feel for getting a pair of headphones, let alone the most premium phone in the world. But the excitement quickly turns into panic when you realize how much work is ahead of you. </p>
<p> One of the first things you’ll want to do is moving all your contacts to the iPhone. Although Google and Apple aren’t the brightest examples of professional cooperation, moving your contacts from Android to iOS is actually easier than you’d expect. You’ll just have to follow a few rules. </p>
<p> I’m going to show you what you need to do here. Just follow the instructions, and you’ll move your contacts from one ecosystem to another without any fuss. </p>
<p> Sync contacts using Gmail </p>
<p> The most straightforward way to move your contacts to iOS is by simply installing Gmail. Once you install Google’s email client, it will automatically bring all your synced contacts with it. Assuming you backed up your contacts to your Google Account first (in case you haven’t, just take a look at this article). </p>
<p> Once you install Gmail, just make sure the sync is enabled, and contacts will appear. In case you’re not sure how to do that, here’s a step-by-step explanation: </p>
<p> Go to the App Store and install Gmail. </p>
<p> Open Gmail and login with your Google Account. </p>
<p> Now, head over to Settings > Passwords & Accounts. </p>
<p> Tap Gmail, and make sure Contacts is selected. </p>
<p> Enabling this option will surely sync all your Google contacts with your new phone. However, there’s a chance those contacts won’t show in the Contacts app. If you still can’t see your contacts in the app, just do the following: </p>
<p> Open the Contacts app. </p>
<p> Tap Groups. </p>
<p> Make sure the All Gmail option is selected. </p>
<p> That’s about it. Although Apple and Google usually make it harder for their respective users to use the other company’s services, transferring contacts doesn’t fall into this category. You can get the job done in a matter of minutes. </p>
<p> Import from SIM </p>
<p> Many people don’t know this, but Apple doesn’t let you import contacts from your phone or iCloud to your SIM card. It’s a security thing, you wouldn’t get it. However, the opposite way works. </p>
<p> If your SIM card already has contacts stored on it, you can seamlessly export them to iCloud or even your Google Account. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Contacts. </p>
<p> Tap Import SIM contacts. </p>
<p> Choose the account you want to import your contacts to. </p>
<p> There you go, importing the existing contacts from your SIM card is maybe even the easiest way to go. </p>
<p> On the other hand, you should keep in mind that no new contacts you save on your current iPhone will be stored on your SIM card. So, relying on your SIM card for transferring contacts across Apple devices may not be the best solution in the long run. </p>
<p> Move Google contacts to iCloud </p>
<p> It’s important to keep in mind that syncing Google contacts using the above-mentioned method will only show contacts in the Contacts app. Your Google contacts won’t be automatically uploaded to iCloud. </p>
<p> If you want to literally transfer your contacts from Google to iCloud, you’ll have to do some extra work. To complicate the situation even further, you won’t be able to do that on your iPhone. You’ll have to export your contacts in the browser on your computer, and then manually upload them to iCloud. </p>
<p> Click Settings (the gear icon), and choose Import vCard. </p>
<p> Choose the vCard you just exported. </p>
<p> That’s about it, all your contacts are now safely stored on your iCloud account. When you do this, you don’t even need to sync Gmail contacts with your iPhone, because the new iCloud contacts will now appear in the app. </p>
<p> I know the whole process probably requires more time than it should, but you also can’t say it’s too complicated. Whether Apple of Google will change something remains to be seen. If that happens, we’ll update this article accordingly. </p>

<p> Apple is all about the exclusive, we are well aware. But it seems that the Google is following those trends with Pixel and Nexus handsets that are light years in front other OEMs in terms of software support. For example, some Nougat-ready models are still running Marshmallow OS, while the Android O Beta is on the horizon for Pixel and Nexus models. And most of the times, the delay is OEMs’ fault. </p>
<p> However, even though Android O won’t be available until later this year, you’re already able to taste some of its features on your phone. Namely, it seems that there’s a way to use the Pixel Launcher featured in the Android O Preview (version 1) release on every Android-powered device past Marshmallow 6.0.1.

<p> How to fix Netflix issues on Android phones </p>
<p> When it comes to multimedia entertainment, Netflix and its peers stand at the top of the hill gazing upon conventional media below. It’s only the question of time before the media streaming services replace (or completely abolish) cable TV providers. And their main weapon in that digital war is the compatibility for portable devices. </p>
<p> The Netflix Android app is great and offers all on-the-go features you would expect from a media streaming service. With affordable membership subscription, you’ll be able to enjoy a plentitude of movies and TV shows in high definition, including exclusives. But, no matter how good software is, it’s always going to have some issues. So, today we prepared the list of best-known Netflix issues, with explanation how to resolve them. If you’re experiencing any issues with your favorite platform on your handheld device, check the list below. </p>
<p> Connection issues </p>
<p> Connection issues are the first obstruction standing between you and your favorite content. So, you may want to check these steps in order to troubleshoot your connection and get it off the table. </p>
<p> Use Wi-Fi instead of the mobile data to load movies. A slow or unstable connection will lead to a time out and you won’t be able to play anything seamlessly. Moreover, you’ll reduce additional expenses. </p>
<p> Make sure that the all other devices connected to the same network aren’t hogging on your bandwidth. Pause downloads or streams on your PC before using Netflix on your smartphone. Once the stream is finished, you can get back to downloading. </p>
<p> Restart your router. It’s important to wait for approximately 1 minute before turning it on again. </p>
<p> Disable router firewall. Some routers have a built-in firewall and that will certainly slow down your connection or even block it temporarily. </p>
<p> Update your Netflix app. It seems that Google DNS setting is known culprit for Android connectivity issues. Latest updates are, as stated by developers, better optimized for Smart DNS. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if everything was working great prior to an update, you can also rollback to an older Netflix version. You can download those here. First, you’ll have to enable installation from unknown sources. Go to Settings > Security > check Unknown sources box. </p>
<p> Reset on-device Wi-Fi settings. Navigate to Settings > Wi-Fi > Tap and hold your network and then tap Forget. Reset your device and reestablish the connection. </p>
<p> Download issues </p>
<p> As you probably know, you can download a film/TV show and watch it later without any connection. That comes in handy when you’re traveling without an accessible network. Moreover, as we already stated in one of our previous articles, it’s highly unadvised to use untrusted networks for various reasons. But, what happens when you are unable to download the favorite movie because of an unexpected error? Firstly, have in mind that not all of the available titles are downloadable. This is what you should check in order to possibly resolve this issue. </p>
<p> The first step is to make sure you have enough storage space. Those movies/TV show episodes can go up to 4 GB or more, so clean up your storage before downloading. Delete the downloads you already watched. Also, you can manipulate between internal storage and SD. So, in case you want to store downloads on SD, you can do it this way. </p>
<p> Tap Menu icon. </p>
<p> Tap App Settings. </p>
<p> Under the Downloads, select Download Location. </p>
<p> In addition, you can vastly reduce download time and file size with Standard video quality. For the screens that size, the difference between the Standard and High quality is negligible. This is how to change the video quality of your downloads. </p>
<p> Tap Menu icon. </p>
<p> Open App Settings. </p>
<p> Under the Downloads, select Video Quality. </p>
<p> This feature is available only for HD-ready devices and you can find that list of eligible devices here. Additionally, users with custom ROMs can have download issues occasionally. </p>
<p> Log in issues </p>
<p> Besides the previously presented issues, a lot of users encountered problems with login. Namely, they were unable to connect after various attempts. Sometimes, that is due to Netflix server and you’ll probably receive an error. You can check server status and temporary issues log here. On the other hand, your individual device can have issues on its own. </p>
<p> Now, even though Netflix supports multidevice playback, you should try to sign out of other devices and sign only to your Android handset. Moreover, you should try to sign in using a browser on your device. If you still haven’t succeeded, try reinstalling the app. </p>
<p> In addition, you can ask for a password reset and try signing again. Navigate to this page within your Android/PC browser and follow further instructions. Once you’ve created a new password, try to login in again. </p>
<p> Streaming issues </p>
<p> We deliberately saved streaming issues for the end since they’re highly related to connection issues. However, if you’re sure that everything regarding connection is on point, the app itself may be a culprit. So, follow these instructions to troubleshoot the Netflix app. </p>
<p> Navigate to Apps or Application manager. </p>
<p> Locate Netflix app and open options. </p>
<p> Tap Clear Cache and then Clear Data. </p>
<p> Open Netflix app, log in and try to stream anything. </p>
<p> Additionally, make sure that the app is up to date. With frequent updates, you should overcome usual bugs and glitches. This goes for all supported devices and not only for Android app. </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Open Menu. </p>
<p> Tap My Apps. </p>
<p> Tap Netflix and select Update. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. If you have any questions or suggestion we should address additionally, make sure to tell us in the comments. </p>
<p> If the Netflix app is having problems then you can use another application similar to the teatv apk download </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/nexus-5x-overheat-charging" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844261" filename="nexus-5x-overheat-charging">
<p> Fix: Nexus 5X overheats while charging </p>
<p> Nexus 5x is a remarkable mid-range device powered by Google and constructed by LG. If you’re unable to obtain the Google Pixel or it’s too pricey for your budget, but still want a clean Android without bloatware, the 5x is the most affordable smartphone you can look for. </p>
<p> However, even though this device is both hardware and software-wise excellent, it’s not without issues. We listed most common ones, but there are some that didn’t include in the initial list. One of those is constant overheating with common symptoms. In the short span, minor overheating can’t cause any trouble, but if the problem is persistent, especially with high temperatures outside, it can be quite a pain. </p>
<p> Firstly, it will slow down your device substantially. Secondly, it may cause hardware malfunction, and that is obviously a grave problem. Because of that, we prepared some solutions that should help you retain normal temperatures with your Nexus 5x. If you have similar issues, check the list below. </p>
<p> Don’t use your phone while charging </p>
<p> Overheating problems are not uncommon for the devices with Quick charging feature. Even though this speeds up charging cycle considerably, it may cause overheating. Especially in the scenarios when you use your Nexus 5x while it’s plugged in and charging. Most of the time, this isn’t the case with the simple tasks, but if you’re chasing that record in some demanding game, it will affect your device temperature marginally. </p>
<p> So, leave the phone be for some time, and after the battery is charged to a preferable level, continue playing. </p>
<p> Check the resource hogging apps in the background </p>
<p> Even though the Nexus 5x runs quite smoothly with the most apps in the background, some of them may still cause a lot of problems. Namely, it’s safe to say that some apps are unoptimized and resource-hogging, and if those are feasting on your CPU in the background, well, that’s solid explanation behind the overheating. </p>
<p> So, make sure to check background apps activity and locate the app that’s causing constant CPU usage. The more the CPU is in constant hyperactivity, the greater the chance that the phone will reach unwanted temperatures. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions to locate and exterminate that pesky app from working in the background: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Battery. </p>
<p> Check the apps that are working in the background. </p>
<p> Once you’ve determined which app is the culprit, navigate to Settings > Apps. </p>
<p> Locate the app and uninstall it or force stop it. </p>
<p> In addition, you can download some of the task-killing apps from the Play Store and use it to resolve issues with the certain app or track the app’s behavior in more detailed manner. We recommend Greenify, but the supply of similar apps is amazing, so you can easily find the alternative if you find it lackluster. </p>
<p> Make sure that your battery isn’t faulty </p>
<p> Most of the OEMs nowadays are using non-removable batteries in order to gain more space for other hardware parts while retaining acceptable phone size at the same time. And that’s good, but still, if your battery is faulty or not in a good condition, most of the time you’ll need a professional to check it out. </p>
<p> And battery issues can most certainly cause overheating of the named device. Battery life reduces after some period, but if spot changes after a limited time of use, make sure contact your retailer/carrier and replace the device or get it repaired. </p>
<p> Remove the casing </p>
<p> The best analogy for this is to imagine yourself working hard and sweating furiously with the winter coat on. That’s quite the same for handsets. Protective casing is quite good for avoiding physical damage to your phone, albeit in the warm weather and after extensive use, it will cause overheating. </p>
<p> So, remove it for some time and look for changes. If heat retention is decreased, check for other alternatives to protect your phone but let it ”breathe” a little. </p>
<p> That should do it. If overheating is extended and it can’t be prevented with the steps above, make sure to take it for repair. The more you wait, the greater the chance for some critical damage inflicted upon your Nexus 5x. </p>

<p> Nexus 5X runs slow after installing Android Oreo [Fix] </p>
<p> UPDATE: As it appears, there’s an issue with OpenGL rendering in Android O on Nexus devices. So, in order to make your device working better, it’s a good idea to switch to set rendering to OpenGL(Skia). This workaround slightly improved my device’s performance, and hopefully, it’ll do the same thing for you. </p>
<p> Here’s how to change GPU renderer on your Nexus 5X: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > System </p>
<p> Go to Developer options, and switch OpenGL Renderer to from OpenGL(Default) to OpenGL(Skia) </p>
<p> Hopefully, Google will fix this in some future updates. </p>
<p> Thanks Georgi for the tip! </p>
<p> Original article: </p>
<p> Some Nexus devices, including my own Nexus 5X, have just received Android Oreo update. People are still confused about the Oreo rollup, as nobody knows for sure when their phone will get the update. But those who already received it, might not be totally happy with the new Android version. </p>
<p> I’ll get straight to the point. After installing Android Oreo, my Nexus 5X started running slow and laggy. Which is the complete opposite of ‘better performance’, promised by Google. Every action on the phone seems to perform slower now. </p>
<p> It even takes a couple of extra seconds for the keyboard to show up?! The revamped notification bar is laggy, it takes longer than usual for the phone to unlock. Apps are slower, and so on and so forth. Of course, the phone hasn’t been rendered unusable, but the fact that it’s slower than it used to be a couple of hours ago (when everything worked seamlessly), is just annoying.So far, I haven’t found any helpful info about this problem online. But that’s probably because the majority of users hasn’t even got the update yet. And I was ‘lucky’ enough to receive it earlier. </p>
<p> Since Android Oreo is probably the last major update for Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, the only thing that crosses my mind is that Google hasn’t optimized the new system for older phones yet. Which is totally unacceptable! </p>
<p> I’ll keep an eye on the situation in the coming days. Things will probably get clearer once more people receive the Oreo update. Hopefully not too many people will suffer from this issue, because that could be a huge problem for Google. </p>
<p> As soon as I find more info or any solution for this issue, I’m going to update this article accordingly. </p>
<p> Have you already installed Android Oreo on your device? Are there any issues? Let me know in the comments below. </p>

<p> Your Nexus 5x still works? We bought two when they came out– they both went black and we lost all of our valuable texts. LG admits to the defect. I recommend backing up your data, and buying another phone that isn’t LG </p>

One solution, which is not a silver bullet, but seems to improve performance and battery life considerably, is to disable background usage for apps that are not optimized for Oreo (Yes… Even in 2018) You do that by going to settings, apps and notifications, going by each app, and clicking on battery usage . If there is a toggle slide for “background activity”, disable it. Do that for as many apps as possible. This shall not affect notifications (although don’t take my word for it). You’re going to see impressive speed ups from your device (as it… Read more » </p>

<p> Nexus 6P common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Before Google decided to get into the hardware market race individually with the Pixel, they made a few devices in cooperation with Samsung, LG, and Huawei. The most renowned device they powered was created by Huawei and it goes by the name of the Nexus 6P. This handset was immediately acknowledged as a remarkable combatant in the flagship level. And it still is. </p>
<p> However, even though the 6P offers a slick design, great screen, clean Android with fastest updates, it still has some issues. Some of them are small or even negligible, others are total dealbreakers. It depends on your luck, more than a misuse. So don’t blame yourself if the boot loops start or screen starts flashing abruptly. </p>
<p> We enlisted common issues regarding this exquisite model that’s far beyond flawless. Also, the instructions for advanced troubleshooting steps can be found at the bottom. We hope you’ll find them helpful. </p>
<p> Nexus 6P Common issues round-up and fixes </p>
<p> Connectivity issues </p>
<p> It’s not uncommon for a smartphone of any kind to have connectivity issues. Even though Nexus 6P is in many regards great, users reported a large variety of issues. And those reports include both Wi-Fi and Mobile Data, with different symptoms. Some users are unable to connect, while others are experiencing unstable or slow connection. And that’s not how the things are supposed to work. For that purpose, we prepared some tips that should help you resolve connectivity issues, so you can use your device just like intended. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi </p>
<p> Update your OS and make sure to use the stable version. Android O Beta isn’t included. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restart router or modem. </p>
<p> Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz. It lacks range, but it’s a more stable option. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition within Recovery settings. </p>
<p> Reset phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Mobile Data </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Re-establish carrier settings manually. For the individual setup, check your carrier’s site. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth while using Mobile Data. </p>
<p> Make sure you haven’t set Mobile Data limit. </p>
<p> Check your SIM card. </p>
<p> Switch to other data transfer technology, i.e. from 3G to 4G or LTE. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings. </p>
<p> That should get you going. Have in mind that the Android OS version can heavily impact all-around system behavior. If you’re running unstable version, there’s a chance that your custom settings won’t function. In that scenarios, it’s safest to restore your device to the default version by resetting to its factory settings. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> Bluetooth is somewhat a problem from the beginning with the 6P. And it intensified with some of the previous Nougat updates that affected many users. Moreover, users around the world are rightfully dissatisfied with Google’s inability to resolve problems that are present for quite some time. Namely, users reported that they were unable to connect to already paired devices or that the connection is unstable and that affects their use substantially. </p>
<p> We looked up for the possible solutions and this is what we found: </p>
<p> Delete all pairings and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Check the pairing device. It’s not uncommon for the headset or car system to get out of hand sometimes. </p>
<p> Don’t use other connections while using Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Reset factory settings. </p>
<p> If the problem is persistent, there’s a chance that your Bluetooth radio is faulty. In that case, the obvious step is to contact your carrier or a responsible vendor. </p>
<p> Battery issues </p>
<p> Well, battery on the Nexus 6P caused a lot of problems for users around the world. And some of them decided not to hold on and pressed charges against Google and Huawei, respectively. That kind of shows how much trouble faulty batteries cause on the Nexus 6P. Boot loops and sudden drains were, obviously, the drop that spilled the glass. </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing boot loops, do yourself a favor and replace the device. On the other hand, it’s not always certain that the hardware is to blame for battery issues. With the frequent updates, there’s always a chance that something may go wrong in the software department. For that purpose, check out this tips to increase battery life, at least to the slightest extent: </p>
<p> Disable power-consuming background apps. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Location > Mode, and choose Device only. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Location > 3-dot Menu > Scanning, and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning, respectively. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset factory settings. </p>
<p> Screen Overlay issues </p>
<p> Screen Overlay is a nifty feature that enables certain apps to appear on top of other apps. Basically, it grants some distinctive multitasking features to apps like Facebook Messenger bubble heads or WhatsApp chat pop-ups. Now, with the installation of the certain app, you automatically grant the permission to a certain app to draw over other apps. But, it seems that due to update changes or system corruption, Screen Overlay prompt keeps popping to inform you that some apps need permissions in order to show on top. </p>
<p> Well, the Nexus 6P had a massive issue with that distinctive error in Marshmallow, but it allegedly still suffers from same ills in Nougat, as well. Luckily, the resolution isn’t too complex, and these instructions should help you to get rid of Screen Overlay annoying prompts. </p>
<p> Click on 3-dots menu. </p>
<p> Tap Configure apps. </p>
<p> Now, you can enable them one by one to see which is causing the Screen Overlay prompt. </p>
<p> After you find the culprit, you can enable other apps one by one and use your device just like before. </p>
<p> In addition, you can reset all permissions for apps and enable them to draw on other apps later. </p>
<p> Microphone issues </p>
<p> Sub par in-call quality is another issue reported by various users. All that features on 6P are great, but what to do with the phone that offers the lackluster or quiet sound quality? Well, we not so much, to be perfectly honest. To make the things even worse, the main culprit may just be the noise-canceling back microphone. Due to lack of proper software optimization, it downgrades in-call quality. And that wasn’t the initial idea, was it? </p>
<p> Some users managed to resolve this problem by covering the noise-canceling back mic. You can try to do that, it might improve your overall in-call experience. </p>
<p> Screen rotate issues </p>
<p> Nexus 6P with it large screen thrives in landscape mode orientation. It’s great for High-quality videos, it’s amazing for reading and typing. However, occasionally, even though the automatic screen rotation is enabled, the screen just get stuck with portrait orientation. In order to make your life just a bit easier and resolve the problem at hand, we prepared some steps you should take into consideration. Hopefully, they should help you resolve this problem. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Boot in safe mood. </p>
<p> Uninstall apps that may affect screen rotation. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings. </p>
<p> OK Google issues </p>
<p> Google’s smart assistant debuted on Nexus devices, and it should be working the best on Nexus 6P, the most premium of them all. However, that’s not always the case. The most common issue, reported by many users, is the absence of the beep sound after you summon OK Google with the voice command. </p>
<p> This can be resolved by following these steps: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Accessibility. </p>
<p> Enable Switch access. </p>
<p> Moreover, you can try and clear the data and cache from Google app. </p>
<p> Instructions: Wipe cache partition, Safe Mode, Reset Network and Factory settings </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate trough the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Enable Safe mode </p>
<p> Press end hold the Power button until you see the Power Off menu. </p>
<p> Tap and hold the Power Off option on the screen until you’re prompted to restart in the Safe mode. </p>
<p> Confirm the selection. </p>
<p> If certain problems are not present while the device is in the Safe Mode, the 3rd-party app is most of the time the main suspect behind the problem. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> This will reset all network settings, including APN, wireless, and Bluetooth settings. </p>
<p> Reset factory settings </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Backup Now to save your data to a cloud service. Additionally, you can backup your data to a PC. </p>
<p> After it is done, in the same menu choose Reset Phone. </p>
<p> Tap Erase All and confirm. </p>
<p> The device will reboot and start the process that should last for less than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> This will completely restore every customized setting, so make sure to backup your data. </p>
<p> With these instructions, we’re wrapping it up. Don’t forget that this is great, premium device and that you should expect premium service. If you have issues and the workarounds we presented fell short, make sure to contact your vendor or carrier and ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> And don’t forget to share with us and our readers, questions, suggestions or some other issues we forgot to mention. We eagerly await your thoughts on this matter. </p>
<p> 1) Enable “OK Google detection” in Settings/Google/Search/Voice 2) Train your voice 3) Disable “OK Google detection” in Settings/Google/Search/Voice 4) Go to Home 5) Say “ok google”, and notice that it still works. You can’t turn it off. </p>
<p> Two phones, both Nougat and Oreo, including factory reset. </p>
<p> Don’t say that disabling microphone permission to Google is the solution. That breaks speech recognition altogether, and causes other permission pop-ups in Google apps. </p>

<p> Nexus 6P gets fingerprint gestures in Nougat 7.1.2 (+ beta enroll instructions) </p>
<p> One of the best Android phones from 2015 that still stands firm must be the Nexus 6P. Google and Huawei made a brilliant, 5.7-inch handset fueled with pure Android. Besides the Pixel models, you won’t find cleaner and faster Android in the market. </p>
<p> Moreover, besides the great camera and an amazing display, the Nexus 6P received rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. Nowadays, that’s a norm for high-end phones and manufacturers are working on handy ways to utilize this function. With the upcoming Nougat update, we can expect interesting additions to fingerprint features. Today, we prepared the showcase for this feature so you’ll be timely informed. </p>
<p> New Nexus 6P Fingerprint Gestures on Nougat 7.1.2 (expected in April 2017) </p>
<p> Long-awaited gestures are almost here </p>
<p> Fingerprint gestures were implemented in the Nexus 5x in some of the previous updates. Users demanded this feature on their premium Nexus 6P and now it’s finally coming. So, you’ll be able to use the built-in gestures instead of 3rd-party app alternatives. </p>
<p> With the fingerprint gestures, you’ll be able to open your Notification area in the simple swipe downwards. That should speed up your accessibility while maintaining phone security untouched. You can toggle On this feature in Settings > Moves. </p>
<p> How to acquire Nougat 7.1.2 Beta on Nexus 6P </p>
<p> However, since the full version can be delayed, you may want to try out the beta version. This update is the Pixel and Nexus exclusive so other devices are not eligible. To update to 7.1.2 Beta, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Sign In with your Google Account that is active on your Nexus 6P. </p>
<p> Scroll down until you find the Nexus 6P and click Enroll device. </p>
<p> Accept the Terms of the Beta program and tap Join. </p>
<p> You should be prompted with a message that your device is enrolled. </p>
<p> You should receive the 7.1.2 Beta update notification immediately but it can sometimes last for 24 hours. </p>
<p> When the notification appears, choose Download. </p>
<p> Now, make sure you are connected to Wi-Fi and your battery is full. </p>
<p> Tap Restart & Install to start the installation process. </p>
<p> Have in mind that the Beta versions may have glitches, bugs, and issues of different sorts. However, if something goes wrong, you can easily unenroll and return to a stable Nougat version. Just be sure to backup your data, because the downgrade will wipe your system clean. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. Besides fingerprint sensor improvements, we are looking forward to Night mode addition that should make the all-around experience much better. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/nokia-2-2-common-issues" parent_folder="web1" id="file17841486" filename="nokia-2-2-common-issues">
<p> Nokia 2.2 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> In quick succession, Nokia HMD got a lot of Android One devices in various price segments. The successor to Nokia 2 (and, later, Nokia 2.1), Nokia 2.2, is the basic entry device that offers good build quality, slick design, and clean Android for an affordable price. And, today, we made sure to list all Nokia 2.2 common issues and help users around the world tackle them head-on. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Sluggish performance </p>
<p> We can all agree that 12GB or even 8GB of RAM is a tad too much, however, 2GB (3GB is, obviously, better) in the modern smartphone era is only for bareboned entry devices. Paired with a sub-par Mediatek chipset, Nokia 2.2 is by no means a snappy device, even in its price range. At least when it comes to gaming and extensive multitasking. </p>
<p> This, of course, doesn’t explain why some users are experiencing slow app transitions, sluggish animations or frequent screen freezes. The clean, close-to-stock Android OS shouldn’t be like that. Now, the problem is more in the software optimization than in the lackluster hardware. Hopefully, the Android 10 update (when it comes out) will fix these flaws. </p>
<p> In any case, here’s what we suggest in order to speed up your device and reduce stutters: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Reduce animations in Developer options from 1 to 0.5. </p>
<p> Limit the number of background apps in Developer options. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from the Quickstep launcher in the Settings > Apps. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 2. Battery draining </p>
<p> We already mentioned that the Mediatek chipset is not the greatest but it is, at least, power-efficient and it doesn’t put a big strain on the 3000 mAh battery. That, along with a moderately-sized display (by today standards, at least) and clean Android, should get you through the day with 6-7 hours of Screen-on Time. </p>
<p> However, some users reported heavy battery drainage as their Nokia 2.2 barely made it for a couple of hours before needing to recharge. </p>
<p> We suspect that a monthly update broke the device, although some background apps might be draining the battery in the background. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to improve battery life on Nokia 2.2: </p>
<p> Disable Face unlock. </p>
<p> Disable Adaptive brightness and set the brightness manually. </p>
<p> Turn off the “Mobile Data always active” option in Developer options. </p>
<p> Turn off Bluetooth and Location if they are not used. </p>
<p> Restrict background usage for third-party apps. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi auto scan. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 3. Dial pad disappeared from the Phone app </p>
<p> There are multiple reported bugs with the pre-installed default Phone app. The most prominent problem is with the disappearing of the dial pad. This happens during calls so users are unable to utilize a dial pad for some services. </p>
<p> If you have a hard time with this, make sure to try the steps we suggested below and fix the Phone app on the Nokia 2.2: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > All apps > Phone. Clear cache and data from the app. </p>
<p> Navigate to the same path and uninstall updates from the Phone app. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 4. Camera issues </p>
<p> Some users have had a hard time with the stock Camera app. Namely, it seems that the back camera is not working at all, with the weird RGB results showing in the viewfinder upon accessing the app. </p>
<p> Based on reports, third-party camera apps work just fine. This confirms that the problem isn’t in hardware but rather the Camera app is broken. </p>
<p> With that in mind, here’s how to troubleshoot camera issues on Nokia 2.2: </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from the Camera app. </p>
<p> Uninstall Camera updates. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 5. Proximity sensor issues </p>
<p> Another issue closely related to calls has a lot to do with the proximity sensor. As reports state, the proximity sensor is not working for some users and, when they answer the call, the screen doesn’t turn off. The screen is on during calls which shouldn’t happen. </p>
<p> This issue usually occurs due to badly optimized sensor but it might be a hardware problem, as well. </p>
<p> Here are some troubleshooting steps you can try in order to fix proximity sensor issues on the Nokia 2.2: </p>
<p> Run the diagnostic in Service mode. Open dialer and enter *#*#372733#*#*. Scroll down to Proximity Test and test Proximity sensor. </p>
<p> Remove the screen protector. </p>
<p> Check the steps in this article to disable adaptive brightness and, hopefully, address the proximity sensor issues. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6. Wi-Fi issues on Nokia 2.2 </p>
<p> Among many other issues, there are reports about Wi-Fi not working, even when it says that the device is connected to Wi-Fi. It breaks for a couple of minutes and then, apparently, continues working like before. </p>
<p> For this and all related Wi-Fi issues, we recommend taking these steps: </p>
<p> Reboot your device and router/modem. </p>
<p> Delete the SSID from the list of networks and connect again. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth temporarily. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 7. Slow face unlock </p>
<p> The close-to-stock Android experience on the Nokia 2.2 has a lot of advantages, keeping all that bloatware some OEMs bring at bay. However, besides the obvious advantages of clean Android, it definitely misses on some built-in features, like Face Unlock. It does support Google’s face recognition, which is rather slow for some users. </p>
<p> There’s nothing you can do with it, at the moment, except to try and remove/enroll your face again. Other than that, you can wait for the optimization that’s, allegedly, coming with Android 10. </p>
<p> 8. Display issues in certain apps </p>
<p> Some users said that in the dedicated forum that the display on Nokia 2.2 is behaving strangely in certain apps, with the yellow stripe on the side of the screen. Many suggested disabling adaptive brightness. </p>
<p> However, if this doesn’t work, we can only recommend resetting your device to factory settings. If this glitch re-appears even after this action, make sure to take your device to service and ask for the replacement. </p>
<p> 9. Slow charging </p>
<p> The slow charging is another frequently mentioned problem. The out-of-the-box 5W charger is not ideal, but that’s nothing unexpected at this price point. </p>
<p> If you are experiencing slower than usual charging, try enabling Airplane mode while charging the device. </p>
<p> 10. Nokia 2.2 stuck on factory reset </p>
<p> There are many software problems that require a factory reset. And, thanks to cloud storage, backing up and restoring your files and settings is much simpler. However, what to do if the ultimate solution fails you? A few users got stuck on factory reset while trying to reset their handsets. </p>
<p> If that happens, you can only try and access the factory reset again from the Recovery menu. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button to turn off your device. </p>
<p> While Off, plug Micro USB-to-USB cable into your PC. </p>
<p> Press and hold Volume down and connect your phone to the PC while still holding the Volume down key. </p>
<p> Keep holding the key until the Android Robot appears. </p>
<p> Press together Volume up and Power. </p>
<p> Once you’ve gained access to Recovery, use volume keys to navigate to Wipe data/factory reset and tap Power to select it. Tap Power again to confirm the reset. </p>
<p> 11. Overheating </p>
<p> Besides slow charging, the Nokia 2.2 tends to heat during charging sessions more than it should. At least, based on reports of a few users. We need to remind you to stick to a stock charger and, if you need to replace the adapter or cable, make sure to replace it with the original one. </p>
<p> You might reduce overheating by removing the protective case from the back of the phone and avoid using the device while it’s charging. </p>
<p> 12. Multi-touch not working properly </p>
<p> Besides the display issues in apps we already mentioned, multi-touch is also not working properly for some users. Some of them suggested enabling GPU rendering (the Disable HW overlays option) in Developer options. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t help, you can also test the device in Safe mode. Finally, if multi-touch issues on the Nokia 2.2 persist, resetting your device to factory settings is our best bet to resolve them. </p>
<p> 13. Common troubleshooting steps for Nokia 2.2 </p>
<p> Hard-reset the device </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and the Volume Up key until the device restarts. </p>
<p> Access Developer options </p>
<p> Choose Reset options. </p>
<p> While the device is on, press and hold the Power button until the Power menu appears. </p>
<p> Tap multiple times in succession on the Power Off option until the “Restart in safe mode” prompt appears. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> That’s all. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share additional issues we missed or alternative solutions for the listed ones. You can do so in the comments section below. </p>

<p> My Nokia 2.2 was a spare and when needed works almost perfectly except hen receiving a call there is no answer icon. </p>
<p> I reset to factory settings and the problem was cured but when updating and adding my apps the problem came back. I’ve never seen this on any other phone </p>
<p> Phone rings I can’t answer, screen hanging. So bad I even went and flashed the phone downloaded about 5 apps the problem came back. So annoying </p>

<p> Revamped Nokia 3310: Valid successor or a silly clone? </p>
<p> There are two types of people in the world when someone mentions Nokia: </p>
<p> The ones that immediately embark on a nostalgia trip to the pre-Windows era. </p>
<p> And the ones that ignore it like a rare disease or a toxic waste. </p>
<p> The Finnish giant once was a leader in cell phone production, holding the majority of the worldwide market. However, a few bad choices later, Nokia has just stopped being the industry innovator and became Microsoft’s testing ground. We don’t say that Nokia hasn’t produced some quality handsets meanwhile. But, they just missed on Android migration and therefore stagnated. Until now. </p>
<p> But, what’s that? Nokia 3310? The Emperor in new clothes? Well, that has to be something good. Or not? These are the questions we’ll try to answer today. </p>
<p> Nokia 3310 2017: Marketing trickery or new favored memorabilia </p>
<p> Nokia once was a synonym for sturdy and quality devices. Back then when your phone wasn’t a mobile PC with digital camera and a multitude of features. You could call people, send SMS or play simplistic but contagious games. And today, while we are rushing towards an unspeakable smartphone advancements, there is a cult surrounding that old, trustworthy devices. </p>
<p> To use that momentum, Nokia decided to revamp 3310, the model that was, back in the days, everything you could expect from the handheld device. And, to do so, they made a few important changes while trying to keep that original spirit and produced a secondary, backup device for everyday use. The phone is going to be presented in the upcoming months. </p>
<p> Pros </p>
<p> Every user of Nokia 3310 knows two things: that the phone was a hard nut to crack and the battery lasted for days. The new Nokia 3310 seems a bit different, but it closely follows the original device. Visually, it doesn’t look just like the old 3310, but it’s quite similar. </p>
<p> The battery life is really great and will get you to almost 700 hours of standby time. That’s great. It’s great but nothing unexpected from a monoblock device with a 2.4-inch display and removable Li-ion 1200 mAh modern battery. </p>
<p> In addition, the phone runs on an interesting Nokia Series 30+ system and offers a lot of downloadable games and features. The fanbase will be quite happy to hear that improved Snake is there. The price is quite low and you’ll be able to obtain new Nokia 3310 for about $60. </p>
<p> For a simple secondary phone, Nokia 3310 (2017) is quite solid. We can only hope that it will succeed the indestructible nature of old 3310. </p>
<p> Cons </p>
<p> Even though they presented it like a legacy, we think that Nokia 3310 is not up to the task. Don’t get us wrong, we adore the idea. But, somehow they fall short in a few categories. </p>
<p> Firstly, connectivity is quite an issue. The latest addition to the Nokia monoblock family supports only 2G technology. That can be quite an issue since some countries are stopping 2G support. </p>
<p> It’s not strange since that is quite an outdated technology, to say the least. Someone may say that isn’t what this phone is designed for. But, it is. The manufacturer stated that users can get Twitter and Facebook apps for this device. And how they can actually use it, in the first place? Additionally, that renders possible instant messaging unusable, too. </p>
<p> Moreover, the phone packs only the 2MP camera and unchanged menu, the things you can encounter with all other Nokia monoblocks from the past 6-7 years. Like the Asha series. </p>
<p> Our opinion </p>
<p> So, it’s all about the brand, about relentless try to use the bandwagon of the classical model to gain the lost popularity. New Nokia 3310 is a good feature phone, but it’s hard for it to sustain the popularity of the original device. </p>
<p> It kind of remind us of movie reboots. The originals are always much better. However, we certainly hope that the Android variations will make the larger impact on the market and make Nokia great again. Let’s stick with the future and leave the once great device to stay in our dearest memories. </p>

<p> Nokia 5 common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Nokia is back, ladies and gents! After the Microsoft gimmicks, they decided to move on Android and it seems that’s paying off. For starters, they decided to present the three devices for three categories. In the middle, we have one of the best budget phones on the market right now, Nokia 5. The slick metal design, passable hardware specs, solid camera, and clean Android are the main traits. </p>
<p> This handset doesn’t have many issues, but it does have some. We conducted a research and find a few of the most common issues that are bothering Nokia 5 users. We made sure to enlist them below and provide you with the best-suited troubleshooting steps. We hope that you find them informative. </p>
<p> So, without further ado, in case you have had any mischiefs with your Nokia 5, make sure to check the list below. </p>
<p> Low call quality </p>
<p> Some users reported issues with the low in-call sound quality. The speakers are not as loud as one would expect, but still, we’re talking about a budget device that lacks a punch that more expensive devices have. Nonetheless, even though there’s no way to improve hardware, you can perform some tweaks in order to improve the overall experience while talking on the phone. </p>
<p> Remove casings or other screen protectors that might cover the front speaker. </p>
<p> Make sure that you have network coverage. </p>
<p> Turn Off Bluetooth while speaking on the phone. In rare occasions, it can interfere with the signal. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Use a third-party app to tweak speaker. </p>
<p> Have in mind that the problem might be on the other side. If one on the other side has a faulty mic, it’ll obviously affect the sound quality. On the other hand, if you’re experiencing problems on a large scale, there’s a chance that the hardware is affected. In that case, make sure to contact the support or responsible carrier or retailer. </p>
<p> Camera issues </p>
<p> If there’s one thing that users seem to complain about in regard to Nokia 5, it’s the primary camera performance. Nokia is renowned for great camera options throughout the years, but that’s certainly not the main trait of Nokia 5. The camera itself isn’t bad per se, but the following software is causing issues for some users. Nokia promised clean Android and, if that’s even possible, it’s too clean for some people liking. </p>
<p> Namely, in order to preview and access taken photos on stock Nokia 5, you’ll be using Google Photos after. That shouldn’t be the case but, allegedly, an update broke this function. Some users managed to resolve this problem by either downloading the third-party camera app or by restoring the factory settings. </p>
<p> Another problem is related to camera crashes. That might be resolved by simply resetting your device or, in the long shot, by wiping cache partition. </p>
<p> Overheating </p>
<p> Overheating is another problem that’s bothering some users. Because of its premium metal design that even some flagships don’t have, Nokia 5 tends to overheat more than your usual handset. However, that’s nothing to worry about. If the temperature reaches critical levels, the phone will shut down on its own to prevent possible hardware damage. For the purpose of reducing the temperature, follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Don’t use your device while charging. That’s where the phone will heat the most. </p>
<p> Kill some resource-hogging background apps. They can go hard on CPU and there so cause overheating. </p>
<p> Remove the casing. </p>
<p> Don’t expose your device to open sunlight for extended period of time. </p>
<p> If you tend to play GPU-intensive games, make sure to take a break from time to time. </p>
<p> Battery longevity </p>
<p> There’s nothing wrong with the 3000 mAh battery that Nokia 5 packs. It’s can hold even more if you take some tweaks. Namely, even though the clean stock Android is good for battery consumption, you can still do some things to make it even better. After some time of use, the background apps tend to pile up and feast on your phone’s resources. For that purpose, we prepared some possible tweaks you should take into consideration in order to vastly improve your battery life: </p>
<p> Use Battery saving mode. </p>
<p> Manually adjust the screen brightness. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi scanning. </p>
<p> Sudden restarts </p>
<p> If you have had experienced boot loops on Nokia 5, there are 3 things we suspect: </p>
<p> Hardware is faulty and you should contact your carrier or Nokia support center for repair or replacement. </p>
<p> You’ve tempered with custom ROM’s and created a grave problem. Warranty won’t cover rooted devices and don’t do it if you’re not sure how it’s done. </p>
<p> Some third-party app is causing this unusual behavior. </p>
<p> What you can do is to boot into Recovery mode and wipe cache partition. That’s a long shot, but you won’t lose any data, so it’s worth a try. Follow the instructions below to do so on your Nokia 5: </p>
<p> Power off your phone. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and Volume Up button until the phone boots into the Recovery mode. </p>
<p> By using the Volume keys, navigate through the menu until you reach the ”wipe cache partition”. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Press the Power button again to restart your device. </p>
<p> Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Even though the Wi-Fi connection is always preferred, it’s hard to use it on the move. That makes a 4G a valuable network alternative. And, if we take into consideration the current speeds and coverage, Mobile Data isn’t lacking much in comparison to Wi-Fi. Nokia 5 is, as most other modern smartphones, covered in that department. However, certain users reported issues with the LTE after some time of use. Allegedly, they’ve experienced unstable connection and frequent crashes on Nokia 5. </p>
<p> This might be due to bad network coverage, flawed or incorrectly set SIM card, wrong APN settings and many others. So, make sure to check the list below and we should overcome the issue together. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Re-establish carrier settings manually. For the individual setup, check your carrier’s site. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth while using Mobile Data. </p>
<p> Make sure you haven’t set Mobile Data limit. </p>
<p> Check your SIM card. </p>
<p> Switch to other data transfer technology, i.e. from 3G to 4G or LTE. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings. </p>
<p> That should do it. Have in mind that these are mostly individual issues, and that, to date, Nokia 5 is performing quite well for the majority of users. In case you have additional issues, make sure to report them below. We’ll make sure to try and help you. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Nokia 6: Common issues and how to solve them swiftly </p>
<p> When Nokia sold their rights to Chinese HDM and they decided to enter the Android market, we expected the continuation of the decades-long legacy. And that’s what we got to some extent with Nokia 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Nokia 6 is the golden middle, a lower mid-range handset with rather solid specs. But, most of all, it comes with a clean Android and for a fair price. </p>
<p> However, the OEM’s lack of experience and subpar OS optimization led to numerous issues. Especially after Android Nougat handsets were upgraded to Oreo. That is the main reason they replaced this device with the AndroidOne Nokia 6.1 (Nokia 6 2018) as soon as possible. However, this doesn’t mean this is a bad phone. It just, like so many others, have certain isolated issues. </p>
<p> That’s why we brought to you all major issues and provided some viable solutions for every individual problem. In addition, you can find the walkthrough for more complex troubleshooting steps at the bottom of the article. </p>
<p> Overal sound and In-Call issues </p>
<p> The whole breakthrough series of Nokia models (especially the mid-range Nokia 5 and Nokia 6) suffer from various sound issues. Some users report that the sound is low on quality (cracks all the time) and at the same time rather loud. Or barely hearable for others. </p>
<p> Lots of blame goes on Atmos Dolby surround sound and the lack of optimization on Oreo 8.0 and Oreo 8.1. Others have had a rather hard time hearing the other side when calling, as the in-call speaker was also providing a low-quality sound. </p>
<p> These particular issues were less prominent on Nougat and mostly appeared after the Oreo update. Nonetheless, we have a few steps you can try to fix this problem. </p>
<p> Disable Dolby Atmos. </p>
<p> Update your handset (some updates dealt with certain sound issues) </p>
<p> Run the device in a Safe Mode and test the sound. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Camera issues </p>
<p> As the camera is one of the selling and distinguishing points, even for the mid-range or budget devices, Nokia seemingly fell short due to not-so-good software. And good software can take you far, with Pixel devices being a good example. </p>
<p> Maybe the expectations were too high, but the yellow tint and overall lackluster performance are quite troubling. Albeit, it can get fairly better with tweaking exposure and some other manual configuring. However, the pre-installed camera is still far behind the competition. </p>
<p> To make the things even worse, some users weren’t able to even open the camera app after the Oreo update. We have some steps you can try out to, primarily, make the camera work. After that, we enlisted some tweaks to make it work a tad better. </p>
<p> Update the Camera app, if possible. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Reset Camera settings to default values. </p>
<p> Use Manual mode to set White Balance to Fluorescent. </p>
<p> Rise ISO settings to get a little sharper photos. </p>
<p> Use a third-party camera from Play Store. </p>
<p> Overheating </p>
<p> Overheating is another problem but, in comparison to some other devices, Nokia 6 and its aluminum body are quite deterrent to heat damage. On the other hand, high-temperature spikes are not something you should neglect. </p>
<p> The main reason for overheating, besides the heavy usage (gaming), is the 4G/Mobile Data in the low-coverage regions. Since the antenna over and over again tries to optimize the signal, the phone will consequently heat up, even in the idle mode. </p>
<p> In order to avoid a critical damage to handset’s hardware, we suggest following the steps we enlisted below. </p>
<p> Don’t use your device while charging. That’s where the phone will heat the most. </p>
<p> Kill some resource-hogging background apps. With third-party app or within Developer options > Running services. </p>
<p> Remove the casing. </p>
<p> Don’t expose your device to open sunlight for an extended period of time. </p>
<p> If you tend to play GPU-intensive games, make sure to take a break from time to time. </p>
<p> Battery Drain issues </p>
<p> Now, the unexpected battery drain after an update shouldn’t be a common occurrence on a stock Android device. However, some users are certain that the battery life and SoT dropped substantially after the Oreo 8.0 and Oreo 8.1 hit the deck. </p>
<p> This is especially visible in the latest iteration of Android Oreo, 8.1, where the 3000 mAh battery lasts a few hours less than before the update. </p>
<p> Besides the decreased battery life, more than a few users experienced slower charging sequence after an update. In order to increase the screen time and reduce battery drains, we can offer some solutions here. </p>
<p> Terminate background apps with a third-party app or in Developer options. </p>
<p> Use Battery saving mode. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Manually adjust the screen brightness. The Auto-brightness isn’t working as intended more times than not. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi scanning. (Developer options). </p>
<p> Disable Mobile Data Always On (Developer options). </p>
<p> Use an original charger you’ve got with the handset. </p>
<p> Update Firmware. </p>
<p> Freezing/Lags issues </p>
<p> Freezes and lags, followed by the app crashes, are also a commonly-reported problem for HDM’s Nokia 6. One would imagine that the clean Android on a handset with more than enough hardware power will perform without issues. Sadly, that doesn’t seem to be the case. </p>
<p> At least, the crashing of third-party apps can be allotted to those apps. But, the freezing and glitching when working in the background with mere system resources, shouldn’t be a thing at all. Not to mention a few reports where Nokia 6 went completely “dead” on some users. </p>
<p> Here are some steps you can try out in order to address these issues: </p>
<p> Boot the device in a Safe Mode and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Uninstall recent apps. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Lower the animations scaling (Developer options). </p>
<p> Reset the phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Touchscreen and Fingerprint scanner issues </p>
<p> These issues are not as common as some other, but they are quite grave when occur. The affected users stated that they weren’t able to do anything with the navigation keys the handset completely froze. Even the hard reset wasn’t of much help. The lesser touchscreen issues concern bad multitouch experience and lack of precision on touch. </p>
<p> A fingerprint scanner is, seemingly, prone to issues as well. Some users stated that the recognition is the problem or the scanner is performing slower than before. </p>
<p> Try these steps to fix the Fingerprint reader on Nokia 6: </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Clean the fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Connection-wise, Nokia had more to offer than their price-range competition. However, the wider support than some Chinese manufacturers (LTE) won’t take you too far if Mobile Data won’t work. To make the things even worse, some users have had a hard time using Wi-Fi, as the connection is either unstable or they can’t even connect. </p>
<p> These, as many other issues we put in this list, are particularly occurring after a system update. This doesn’t mean that some users haven’t had network issues on Nougat, of course. </p>
<p> Here are some solutions you can try in order to fix Mobile Data and Wireless issues, respectively: </p>
<p> Hard reset the device. </p>
<p> Boot in Safe Mode and try connecting. </p>
<p> Check the SIM card tray. Confirm that the SIM card is properly set. </p>
<p> Disable NFC and Bluetooth temporarily. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> We could’ve put this section under the Sound, as the majority of Bluetooth issues (at least the ones we got our hands on), refer to bad sound on Bluetooth headphones and speakers. The output is seemingly atrocious for so many of them. </p>
<p> However, there’s a minority which had a hard time connecting to other devices via Bluetooth after an update. Especially the in-cars media devices. </p>
<p> We enlisted some possible solutions below, so make sure to follow them through: </p>
<p> Hard reset the device. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> Disable absolute volume (Developer options) </p>
<p> SD Card issues </p>
<p> Finally, the last spot is reserved for a minor problem with certain SD cards. Some users weren’t able to set the SD card as a part of the internal storage. </p>
<p> Now, this might be the problem if the Micros SD card is too slow to be read as a internal storage. The best thing to do if the SD card won’t work on your Nokia 6 is to reformat it and use it as an external storage. </p>
<p> How to’s for Nokia 6 </p>
<p> Hard-reset the device </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and the Volume Up key until the device restarts. </p>
<p> Access Developer options </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and Volume Up key to enter the Recovery mode. </p>
<p> With Volume keys, highlight the Wipe cache partition and press the Power button to confirm. </p>
<p> Press the Power button again. </p>
<p> Boot in Safe Mode </p>
<p> While the device is on, press and hold the Power button until the Power menu appears. </p>
<p> Tap multiple times in succession on the Power Off option until the “Restart in safe mode” prompt appears. </p>
<p> With that, we can conclude this article. Hopefully, you’ve found it informative and helpful in resolving some issues. In addition, if you’re unable to resolve the problems with the troubleshooting steps we provided, make sure to take the device to service and use your warranty before problems grow even more. </p>

<p> Android 10 arrives on Nokia 7.1, causes some issues </p>
<p> Two days ago, Nokia announced the rollout of Android 10 to the Nokia 7.1. This announcement marks the third Nokia phone to receive the Android 10 update, after the Nokia 8.1 and Nokia 9 PureView received it a few days back. </p>
<p> According to the company, the Nokia 7 Plus, 6.1, and 6.1 Plus are next in line for Android 10. Users of these devices should start receiving Android 10 by the end of the year, or at the beginning of 2020. </p>
<p> The update brings all of Android 10’s signature features to the Nokia 7.1, including the popular Dark Mode, the new gestures, and the redesigned permissions system. However, the new Android 10 Focus Mode is set to arrive later, as it’s still in beta. </p>
<p> How to update Nokia 7.1 to Android 10 </p>
<p> The global rollout of Android 10 has just started, which means some users will probably have to wait a day or two for the update to appear for them. You’ll be notified when the update is ready for install, but you can also check manually to make sure its there. </p>
<p> Here’s how to update your Nokia 7.1 to Android 10: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Navigate to About Phone > System updates. </p>
<p> Tap Check for Updates to check if your phone has received the update yet. </p>
<p> Nokia 7.1 Android 10 issues </p>
<p> Some users have already installed the update. While the update’s been a smooth ride for some, others are experiencing a few issues. Here’s what one user reported on Nokia forums: </p>
<p> “Audio is messed up. there is a distortion when you play WhatsApp audio messages, the same issue is with some games and broadcasting apps like BIGO Tv, etc.. </p>
<p> Battery Draining so Fast, hardly 5-6 Hours standby time. </p>
<p> It takes forever to charge the phone, no quick charge at all. </p>
<p> When you switch between apps, every app just reloads itself, the duration to keep them in memory was good enough in Pie“. </p>
<p> Now, that doesn’t mean you’ll encounter the same issues when you install Android 10 on your Nokia 7.1. You may not have a single problem, or something else might bother you. It’s really a roll of the dice. </p>
<p> If you have encountered any problems upon installing Android 10 on your phone, feel free to share them with us in the comments below. </p>

<p> Disastrous update and a nightmare to get back to Pie. Update is such a mess that I went back to my Nokia 6 while awaiting/dreaming of a quick fix for my Nokia 7.1 Anyway, no such luck so I just bought a Samsung. It’s a joke that Nokia gave its approval for this horrid release. If I could mail my phone to Nokia and have an employee swallow it whole, this would make the planet a better place. </p>

<p> Nokia 7.2 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> The Nokia 7.2, like its predecessor, the Nokia 7.1, is the top of the line in the mid-range segment. This device checks all the boxes, with the Android One program being the biggest selling point and its go-to card. However, HDM Nokia hasn’t done a brilliant job with updates and patching bugs, so there are more than a few Nokia 7.2 issues. </p>
<p> In case you are having a hard time with certain bugs, we gave our best to find some solutions online and present them in the list below. Make sure to check them out. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Phone shuts down during charging </p>
<p> Probably the most serious problem that resulted in many users returning their devices and asking for the replacement. Namely, it seems the Nokia 7.2 has issues with overheating, especially during charging. To protect the internals from malfunction, the device will power off on its own. </p>
<p> Now, it seems that HMD tackled the issue with some software tweaks and it doesn’t appear to be as wide-spread as after the initial release. Either way, if you are affected by this, we have a few tips for you. </p>
<p> Here’s what you can do to reduce overheating during charging and avoid the device powering off: </p>
<p> Remove the protective casing while charging. </p>
<p> Stick to the original 10W charger. This device allegedly supports up to 18W Quick Charge but that doesn’t work as intended and it’s not official. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Data while charging the device. </p>
<p> Ensure that firmware on your Nokia 7.2 is up to date. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 2. Lags and stutters </p>
<p> People are slowly starting to doubt the Android One program. Promised timely updates are not there on time and, security monthly updates often create new problems instead of fixing the old ones. In this case, Nokia 7.2 users reported noticeable lags and stutters, especially in the Notification bar and when interacting with the Power button. </p>
<p> Namely, it seems that there’s a bug causing any activity within the Notification bar and Quick Access menu to result in stutters. Also, the Power Button to light the screen causes lag and users need to wait for some time until the Home screen (or apps) load. </p>
<p> This is a major problem and, although some updates mitigated it to some extent, some users are still experiencing similar issues on the Nokia 7.2. </p>
<p> We have a few things to recommend to reduce the lag, hoping that the expected Android 10 update will fix the problem for good. Here’s what to do to reduce lag on the Nokia 7.2: </p>
<p> Restart your phone. </p>
<p> Reduce animations in Developer options from 1 to 0.5. </p>
<p> Limit the number of background apps in Developer options. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from the Quickstep launcher in the Settings > Apps. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 3. Ambient display issues </p>
<p> Because it comes with the 6.3-inch LCD IPS display, this device doesn’t support Always-on display like OLED devices. However, there’s a nifty feature called Ambient display that works in a similar manner but only when charging the device. It shows notifications and clock on the black background, similarly to AoD. </p>
<p> Now, there are some issues with Ambient display on the Nokia 7.2 concerning notifications that are permanently stuck even when dismissed. In order to fix this, we recommend rebooting your device or clearing cache from the Ambient display system app in Settings > Apps > All apps > Show system services > Ambient display. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can disable this option and enable the one provided by Google in the Google app. All you need to do is navigate to Assistant settings > Phone and enable Ambient display there. </p>
<p> 4. Google app keeps stopping </p>
<p> Google app is an integral part of the Android system along with many services it offers, including Google Assistant and Google Discover feed. Some Nokia 7.2 users have had a hard time using Google Assistant as it causes Google to stop working. </p>
<p> The best way to address this is to clear cache and data from the app in Settings > Apps > All apps. If that doesn’t help, you can uninstall updates from the app and update it again. Finally, some users pointed out a bug. Allegedly, the system language and Assistant language should be the same. </p>
<p> 5. Bad call quality </p>
<p> The in-call sound quality is not exactly the best for some users. Users report ‘robotic’ sound when talking on the phone. The cause of the problem usually lies in hardware, but we can recommend a few things. </p>
<p> First of all, ensure that you have good network coverage. In addition, consider removing the screen protector and protective case and check in-call quality again. If that doesn’t help, just ask for the replacement. Your device probably has a factory defect. </p>
<p> 6. Touchscreen issues </p>
<p> Touchscreen issues follow the aforementioned lags and stutters. This device is, for many, not bringing exactly a snappy experience. Especially after unlocking the device, as everything takes too much time. This applies to the fingerprint sensor, as well. It requires too much time to unlock. </p>
<p> For the common troubleshooting, check step 2 above. Removing screen protector, disabling face unlock, and keeping your device up to date is also suggested. In regards to a sluggish fingerprint sensor, there’s no much to do other than update the firmware and hope that they patched bugs. Removing and adding fingerprints again won’t do much. </p>
<p> 7. Low volume on Bluetooth audio </p>
<p> This is so common these days on many devices, regardless of the price point. Users report that even the highest volume settings are not exactly loud on the Nokia 7.2. Luckily, there’s a way to tweak this within Developer options. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to enable the Disable Absolute volume option in Developer options: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Open About phone. </p>
<p> Locate the Build number and tap it 7 times in succession to enable Developer options. </p>
<p> Now, you should see Developer options in Settings > System. </p>
<p> Scroll down until you reach the Networking section. </p>
<p> Once there, enable (toggle ON) the Disable absolute volume option. </p>
<p> 8. Battery draining fast </p>
<p> The 3500 mAh battery is a bit subpar in comparison to some of the competition but it’s far from bad. It should provide a reasonable Screen-on Time results, especially since the Nokia 7.2 runs close-to-stock Android One ROM. However, some users reported significant drops in battery life (even when the device is idle) over time and many are blaming an update for that. </p>
<p> We can suggest a few steps to help you improve battery life on your device. Here’s what you can do to reduce battery draining: </p>
<p> Disable Face unlock. </p>
<p> Disable Adaptive brightness and set the brightness manually. </p>
<p> Turn off the “Mobile Data always active” option in Developer options. </p>
<p> Turn off Bluetooth and Location if they are not used. </p>
<p> Restrict background usage for third-party apps. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi auto scan. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 9. Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> Some users noticed Bluetooth issues on the Nokia 7.2, as certain Bluetooth earphones just won’t pair with this handset. Based on these reports, the device selectively connects to some devices, while it won’t work with others. </p>
<p> Other users had issues with the in-car audio systems. They usually manage to connect as intended, but the audio quality in calls is preposterous. </p>
<p> If that’s the case for you, we can recommend following these steps: </p>
<p> Reboot your device and try pairing again. </p>
<p> Disable Mobile Data, NFC, and Wi-Fi and try pairing again. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data from the Bluetooth app. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 10. Proximity sensor issue </p>
<p> Proximity sensor bugs can also be added to the list of reported Nokia 7.2 issues. As we all know, the proximity sensor will detect, during calls, that you are talking and turn off the screen. The moment you move the phone away from your ear, the screen should light up. </p>
<p> Sadly, some users say that the screen frequently won’t light up and they need to press the power button a couple of times to make the screen light. In addition, it tends to mute the caller as if you pressed the Mute button. </p>
<p> Some say that this is an Android One problem (Android in general), as Android One devices like Xiaomi Mi A3 also suffer from this problem. At the moment, we can safely say that updating the firmware is your best bet to resolve this issue. </p>
<p> 11. SD card issues </p>
<p> The Nokia 7.2 supports SDXC cards to expend on the factory memory. Some users have had a hard time with the external memory, as the device won’t recognize their SD card for no apparent reason. </p>
<p> If you are unable to utilize your SD card on the Nokia 7.2, make sure to format it in the FAT32 format. The phone will usually ask you to format the SD card once inserted but, if that doesn’t work, consider formatting it on your PC or any other Android phone. </p>
<p> In addition, make sure to format and use the SD card as external storage, not the internal one. The latter won’t work or it is flawed, for some reason. </p>
<p> 12. Nokia 7.2 not ringing </p>
<p> This is one of the bugs frequently reported on older firmware versions and it looks like HMD fixed it. Namely, the device tends to switch between silent and ringing on its own. It also drops and changes ringing sounds on its own, which is quite peculiar. </p>
<p> If you are having issues with incoming calls, make sure to update your firmware, disable Do Not Disturb, and clear data and cache from the Phone app. Alternatively, you can reset the device to factory settings, although that’s a last-resort solution for the problem. </p>
<p> 13. Camera hangs </p>
<p> A good set of cameras on this device makes relatively good photos. However, like many other assets on this device, the Camera app is also sluggish for some users, shutter speeds and processing are not what users expected. </p>
<p> Have in mind that this, as 95% of issues on the Nokia 7.2 is strictly software-related. The chipset (SD 665), followed by 4 GB of RAM, is fast enough. However, the evergrowing list of bugs makes for the appalling overall experience. </p>
<p> You can try and clear the cache and data from the Camera app. Alternatively, try with GCam ports or third-party Camera apps. Hopefully, the problem will be addressed in the future. </p>
<p> 14. Display issues </p>
<p> The rendering of dark colors is not as precise as on some other devices. It looks that HMD made some color changes to improve the visibility outdoors, making black to be gray. Sadly, probably due to the light sensor, the device will stick to this color even indoors. </p>
<p> In order to fix this, you should disable Adaptive brightness and manually adjust brightness on your Nokia 7.2. After that, make sure to disable the Pure Display in Display settings and black should be black again instead of gray. </p>
<p> 15. Notification LED not working with 3rd-party apps </p>
<p> For some reason, the Notification LED is not working with 3rd-party apps for some users. It works with built-in Phone and Messages but, other than those two, LED is not working at all. It should be working by default for every installed app, but it’s worth checking apps individually and enabling LED notifications. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to check that 3rd-party instant messengers have LED notifications enabled: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Select Notifications. </p>
<p> Select the app for which you want to enable the Notification LED. </p>
<p> Open Advanced. </p>
<p> Enable Notification LED. </p>
<p> For some reason, LED won’t blink instantaneously after you receive notifications. You can make LED blink earlier by choosing to hide sensitive content on the lock screen. This will trigger the LED faster than the usual 5 minutes timeout. </p>
<p> 16. Hissing sounds from the main speaker </p>
<p> Finally, we run into a report about the hissing sound coming from the main speaker. This is explained as static noise, especially when the system volume is under 20%. </p>
<p> We are not sure how to help you with this other than to suggest contacting the Nokia center if the issue persists. </p>
<p> 17. Most common troubleshooting steps for the Nokia 7.2 </p>
<p> Hard-reset the device </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and the Volume Up key until the device restarts. </p>
<p> Access Developer options </p>
<p> Choose Reset options. </p>
<p> While the device is on, press and hold the Power button until the Power menu appears. </p>
<p> Tap multiple times in succession on the Power Off option until the “Restart in safe mode” prompt appears. </p>
<p> And, on that note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and, in case you have any questions or suggestions, make sure to post them in the comments section below. </p>
<p> After the software update, my phone has started to switch itself off especially when not in use for a long period of time. This usually happens at night. What might be causing this problem! </p>

<p> i can turn on my phone but when it comes on nne of the icons wil pop up and then it freezes. what do i do. been off for 2 hours and its stil doing this. also it didnt do this until it up dated </p>
<p> You can deactivate all sensors if you activate developer mode (settings -> about phone -> Build number [at the very bottom] click on it several times until it’s activated). </p>
<p> Go to developer options -> Quick settings developer tiles -> Sensors off </p>
<p> The cool part is that now you can easily turn on/off the sensors in the quick settings menu. Keep in mind that auto-rotate also doesn’t work if you turn off the sensors </p>
<p> Developer mode deactivates also the microphone and camera. </p>
<p> Now I tried the app: Proximity Sensor Reset/Fix (+Overrider service) So far it works nicely </p>

<p> Nokia 9 PureView issues: Fingerprint problems, camera crashes, and more </p>
<p> Nokia 9 PureView is, generally speaking, an exceptional phone. Of course, it revolutionizes the camera sensors implementation by using five of them. And that alone is enough to draw attention from many. But you’ll be using the phone for other stuff, right? </p>
<p> When you look at the Nokia 9 PureView as a whole, you see a well-balanced mid-range device that performs decently. Sure, it’s not the flashiest phone out there, and if you ask me, it’s a bit overpriced for its spec sheet in 2019. But all in all, you’ll do okay with it. </p>
<p> What’s even better is that I haven’t managed to find a bunch of reported issues with the Nokia 9 PureView yet. Sure, it’s still ‘young’, so we can attribute the lack of reported problems to the fact that not too many people own this device yet. Nevertheless, the number of complaints is respectably low, even for the early stage of its lifecycle. </p>
<p> So, if you were unfortunate enough to face any of the following issues, keep reading this article for solutions (or at least to understand the situation better). </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching it, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Fingerprint not working </p>
<p> The fingerprint scanner has been making the most troubles for the PureView users so far. According to numerous reports, it seems Nokia didn’t do the best job when integrating the fingerprint scanner. Namely, the phone requires too much finger pressure to scan the fingerprint. And pressing the screen too hard countless times every day is definitely not going to add up to the phone’s life span. </p>
<p> On top of the technical problems, users have been reporting that the fingerprint scanner doesn’t even work sometimes. However, there’s a solution to this. If you restored a backup when setting up the phone, instead of setting it as new, it’s possible that some of your old apps interfere with the scanner. </p>
<p> So, boot into the Safe Mode, and start investigating. Sure, it’s painful to uninstall each app individually, but at least you’ll deal with the fingerprint sensor failures. </p>
<p> 2. Screen rotation not working </p>
<p> Screen rotation failure is another issue reported on Nokia’s support forums. As one user points out, the screen fails to rotate most of the time, which drastically limits the functionality of this phone, especially when it comes to taking pictures in the landscape mode. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, we still don’t have the workaround for this issue. Perhaps the development team will address with some future updates. So, what can I say? You’ll probably have to wait for the patch. </p>
<p> 3. OK Google not working </p>
<p> Google Assistant issues are common for all Android devices, not just the Nokia 9 PureView. However, it seems that the 9 Pureview owners have more problems with this feature than they should. </p>
<p> Numerous reports are popping up on the support forums about OK Google not working. Right now, there’s no solution to this issue. However, one user pointed out on the forums that the whole Nokia network seems to have the problem with Google Assistant. So, you’ll probably have to wait for either Google or Nokia to deliver a workaround. </p>
<p> 4. Camera crashes </p>
<p> The camera is, of course, the Nokia 9 PureView’s main selling point. It’s amazing what you can achieve with this five-lens setup. But what if the Camera app crashes? Then you’re deprived of the feature you basically bought the phone for. </p>
<p> Well, that’s exactly what happens to some users. The camera app crashes upon opening, and there’s nothing you can do about it. </p>
<p> On the positive side, Nokia already acknowledged this problem and promised a solution. </p>
<p> Thank you for the feedback. Few notes: – With more users out there, we’ve seen a few camera crashes due to battery voltage drop when charge is low. We will address this – Under the display FP sensor has limitations. We will improve the experience. We also have face unlock </p>
<p> So, if you haven’t already received the patch, just keep checking for updates, and you’ll get it soon. </p>
<p> 5. Microphone not working </p>
<p> And the last ‘serious’ problem I managed to find is the microphone issue. According to some users, the microphone just doesn’t seem to work. This problem could also be connected to the above-mentioned Google Assistant issue. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, there’s no solution, as it could easily be a hardware problem. And if you suspect it’s a hardware problem, all you can do really is trading in your phone for the new one. </p>
<p> That’s about it. As you can see, there aren’t too many reported issues with the Nokia 9 PureView yet. That, of course, is good, but even a single slight issue can spoil the feeling of using a new phone. </p>
<p> If you’ve recently encountered a problem I didn’t mention here, feel free to write it down in the comments below. </p>

<p> i started having terrible mic issues after the security patch ~2 weeks ago. Mic will only work if i’m shooting a video. Otherwise, it’s “on mute” all the time. Very annoying, and i have to wear my earphones/bluetooth all the time to make calls and send voice memo’s! Frustrated as hell! </p>
<p> How about sub-standard battery life? On a side note, does anyone have an idea when they may be sending out the free true wireless earbuds that were offered? </p>
<p> Did you hear from other users that Nokia is offering free true wireless earbuds to those who are having mic issues? I chatted with their customer support this morning and they said they couldn’t offer that :(…. I’m very frustrated with the mic issue, but honestly i didn’t feel that the battery life is sub-standard. Definitely much better than my older iPhone 7 </p>

<p> How To Add A Non-Google account to Inbox by Gmail </p>
<p> Even though the new communication technologies have taken the primacy, the emails are still standing strong. More than 201 billion emails are sent daily and a lot of that number is accessed via smartphones. </p>
<p> Google Inbox is a terrific email client that can be used both for Android and iOS. It’s greatly organized, with intuitive design and emails preview feature. Besides its compatibility with Gmail, you can add alternative email accounts and use one app for gathering all your mail. Today we’ll walk you trough procedure that should help you set up multiple non-Google accounts to Inbox. </p>
<p> Adding non-Google accounts to Google Inbox app </p>
<p> The problem with a multitude of email clients, especially on smartphones, is data and resource consuming. So, instead of using numerous clients, you can set up everything on one and there so surpass the difficulties. Your battery will last longer and you’ll experience fewer data and RAM consumption on the daily basis. And since the Gmail is not as good as you would expect from a native email client, Inbox is probably the best solution for you. </p>
<p> In order to progress you’ll need: </p>
<p> Gmail Account connected to Inbox </p>
<p> Gmail app </p>
<p> This is the procedure for setting up your non-Google email with Gmail. </p>
<p> Choose matching account type. </p>
<p> The Google should ask you to use Gmailify for other providers mail. </p>
<p> Now you should have an alternative account in Google Inbox. </p>
<p> Uninstall or disable Gmail and use exclusively Inbox. </p>
<p> However, users reported few issues with this setup. In case you are having some issues, you may try clearing Inbox Data or reinstalling the app. Have in mind that this client is originally intended for Gmail users so some problems may occur. We can only hope for some universal Google solution, especially since Gmail app is most of the time an underwhelming client. </p>
<p> What is your favorite email client? Do you use a single or multiple clients? </p>

<p> Fix: Notifications Not Working after iOS 10/10.1/10.2 update </p>
<p> We recently listed some of the common issues that emerged with iOS 10.2, but there are plenty new issues reported every day. One of the problems that established itself as a great annoyance is the malfunction of the notifications feature. </p>
<p> Supposedly, the notifications signals won’t work on standard services or the third-party apps, either. So, if you are expecting sound or vibration when the message appears, you won’t get any of that. In addition to the already grave problem, the screen isn’t lighting up as well. </p>
<p> This renders the device unusable in the opinion of many users. We prepared some possible solutions so you can try and fix the problem. At least until the Apple addresses the issue and makes their devices usable for all the costumers who upgraded their OS. </p>
<p> Disable Do Not Disturb option </p>

<p> Fix: Nova Launcher crashes in Android </p>
<p> People who are pro-Android always tend to prioritize the customization, referring to it as the best trait of the Google-powered system. You can change almost everything to your liking, to the point that your Android smartphone is just a ”shell” for the endless software ”souls”. If you’re not into rooting your device, you’re just a little bit limited. But, with the proper launcher, as Nova, you can customize almost everything. </p>
<p> There are not many reports of Nova Launcher issues, but it’s low-key impossible to create flawless software that works on hundreds of different handsets with errorless optimization. One of those rare but troubling issues that emerged lately is related to sudden crashes. There are many different causes for Nova crashes, so we prepared a list of workarounds that should resolve the issue from different perspectives. </p>
<p> If you have had experienced crashes in Nova Launcher on your Android lately, make sure to check the list below for answers. </p>
<p> Restart your device and the launcher </p>
<p> The first step seems too obvious but it can help you, nonetheless. Sometimes, due to bugs in regard to system integration of Nova Launcher, you might experience crashes or gradual performance drops. A first troubleshooting step is to restart your device and, hopefully, that should speed things up and relieve you of crashing. </p>
<p> In addition, you can restart solely the Nova Launcher from time to time. This won’t affect your preferences, so you don’t need to worry about that. </p>
<p> First, let’s try with the Nova restart. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Home Screen to summon the Nova Settings menu. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll to the bottom and open Advanced. </p>
<p> Tap Restart Nova Launcher. </p>
<p> Even if this evoked some positive changes, you may as well restart your device, too. </p>
<p> Grant Nova permissions </p>
<p> In order for Nova Launcher to work in a seamless manner and take the role of the default system launcher, you need to grant it certain permissions. For starters, you need to make it the default launcher. Second, you’ll probably want to let it access notifications and phone settings. </p>
<p> This can be done by following these instructions: </p>
<p> Tap Settings and open Apps. </p>
<p> Choose Nova Launcher. </p>
<p> Open Permissions and enable both Phone and Storage. You don’t need to enable Your Location. </p>
<p> Now, choose Home. </p>
<p> Open Default App Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Nova Launcher as the default launcher. </p>
<p> Now, get back to Configure apps screen and open Special Access under the Advanced tab. </p>
<p> Open Notification access and toggle On both Nova Launcher and TeslaUnread, if available. </p>
<p> Clear cache and data </p>
<p> Even though the third-party launcher, once the permission is granted, can take the role of the default launcher on your device, it’s still an app. It collects cache and stores the data in order to maintain the customization and preserve your preferences. Moreover, if you’re a beta tester for Nova Launcher, there’s a chance that the stored data from the previous stable release and the beta upgrades will conflict. So, if you pack either stable or beta version, it’s advised to clear the data and cache and look for changes. </p>
<p> However, have in mind that this procedure will delete your current settings, so make sure to back them up so you can restore them later. On the other hand, some users claim that it’s favorable to start from the scratch and customize everything again. That might take some time, but it’s a good point. </p>
<p> If you’re not sure how to clear the cache and data from the Nova Launcher, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Home screen to open the Nova menu. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Home screen to summon the Nova menu. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Navigate to the bottom and open Backup and restore. </p>
<p> Restore the preferred backup. </p>
<p> That should resolve some of the minor bugs that provoke crashes from time to time. </p>
<p> Remove the Google Companion app </p>
<p> Many users rely on Nova Launcher to provide them with the Pixel-like interface on their non-Pixel smartphones. And, to date, Nova Launcher is doing a great job. With the little help of other third-party apps and moderate tweaking, Nova will indeed look like the Pixel Launcher. Even the Pixel Launcher for Android Oreo which is still not available over OTA. Besides the Icon pack, you’ll need an APK to truly recreate the Pixel Launcher. That’s Google Companion we’re talking about which enables you to access the Google Now feed on the Home Screen with the Nova Launcher. </p>
<p> Now, for some users, the Google Companion integration with Nova Launcher works great. They swipe left on the Home Screen and the News Feed is right there. However, this integration isn’t always perfect, especially if you’re enrolled in the Google Beta (most people do this in order to access the full features of Google Assistant on non-Pixel devices). For some people, this integration just won’t work. So, if you’ve had experienced crashes while using Google Now Feed, you’ll need to disable it in order to regain the overall stability of the launcher itself. Basically, some users are forced to use one or the other. </p>
<p> Yes, we’re well aware that this means the departure of a nifty feature, but, if we need to choose between the one perk and full experience of customization, we’ll stick to latter. So, it’s recommended to remove the Google Companion and look for changes. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Apps. </p>
<p> Navigate to Google Companion and tap Uninstall. </p>
<p> Remove the Pixel-like weather widget from Search Bar </p>
<p> One of the best things about Nova Launcher is that you don’t need too much extra secondary apps to create the interface of your liking. On-screen weather widget, for example. Even though this isn’t fully supported feature, many users are quite satisfied with the weather widget provided by the Nova itself, placed in the persistent Search Bar. This especially emphasizes the ”Pixel look”. Sadly, that’s not the case for a multitude of users. Some of them encountered momentary crashes just after they enabled this feature within the Search Bar settings. </p>
<p> Our first thought is to leave the beta program for Nova. Beta features are in the testing phase, so you should have much better time with the stable version. On the other hand, this still won’t guarantee that the built-in weather widget will work. What you’ll need to do is to disable this feature for the time being and turn to the third-party widget in order to recreate it. Maybe Google enables third party apps to access its features in the future and that will, presumably, enable users to run this widget without fear of further crashes. </p>
<p> Tap and hold the Home Screen to open the Nova menu. </p>
<p> Select Settings. </p>
<p> Hold the Volume Down key to enable Labs where experimental features are presented. </p>
<p> Toggle Off the ”Allow weather in search bar” feature. </p>
<p> Now you can go back to Nova Settings > Desktop > Search bar style, and choose an alternative. </p>
<p> Additionally, we suggest using some small, minimalistic weather widget to fill up space. There are many apps that offer just that, but we’re using a Chronus which is small in size and have great customization features. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app </p>
<p> Finally, if crashes are still present, the reinstallation is the next obvious step. Have in mind that, if you’re using a cracked version of Nova Launcher, even this may not be enough to get rid of the problems. Some of them might work well, while others are just lackluster. On the other hand, if you’re in possession of bought Prime version and crashes are still reoccurring, the reinstallation should help you. </p>
<p> In order to reinstall Nova Launcher, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Open Apps. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Locate Nova Launcher (and TeslaUnread, also) and uninstall it. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Navigate to Play Store and install Nova Launcher again. </p>
<p> You can restore an old backup, but we suggest you start from the scratch. </p>
<p> That should do it. In case you have any questions or suggestions in regards to the subject, make sure to tell us in the comments below. We’ look forward to hearing from you. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> Fix: Nova Launcher Google Now not working </p>
<p> Nova Launcher is probably the most feature-rich custom launcher out there. With some minor tweaking (icon pack and KWGT can come in handy, too), you can make your UI look any way you want. This includes support for the Google Now shortcut when swiping left from the home screen. However, it seems that Google Now is not working on Nova Launcher for some users. </p>
<p> How do I enable Google now in Nova launcher? </p>
<p> If you already have Google Companion, it’s easy. If not, download and install the APK (link below). As simple as that. </p>
<p> Now, if Google Now is not working even after installing and configuring Nova Google Companion, check the steps below to address the problem with ease. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Install Nova Google Companion </p>
<p> This step applies as a solution only if you don’t have Google Companion to start with. If you are not aware, Google Now (Google Feed) that’s usually accessible by swiping left from the home screen, is not available on Nova Launcher from the get-go. </p>
<p> In order to get it, you’ll need to install a companion app that integrates with the launcher. Now, Google doesn’t allow this app on the Play Store so you’ll need to download and install an APK. Once you’ve done that, the only thing remaining is to configure it in Nova Settings and that’s it. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to download and install Nova Google Companion: </p>
<p> Navigate to TeslaCoils’ official website with your smartphone/tablet, here. </p>
<p> Scroll down and download Nova Google Companion by tapping the hyperlink. </p>
<p> Run the APK and allow installation from 3rd-party sources when prompted. </p>
<p> Make sure that Nova is your default launcher. </p>
<p> Now, tap & hold on the home screen and open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Integrations. </p>
<p> Under Google Discover, check both Google Discover and Edge Swipe (optionally) boxes. Select the preferred theme and transition animation and you are set. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Disable/re-enable Google Companion Feed </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you already have the Google Companion but swiping to the left from the home screen doesn’t do a thing, there are some things you can try to fix it. First of all, you can disable it and then re-enable it immediately. This simple action usually resolves the problem completely. </p>
<p> Just navigate to Nova Settings, open Integrations, and then uncheck the Google Discover box. Reboot your device, get back to Google Discover settings and check the box again. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear cache from the Google app </p>
<p> Now, it doesn’t necessarily mean that Nova Launcher (or Companion) is faulty. The problem might be related to the Google app. Due to frequent updates and many (mostly minor) changes, bugs are expected. </p>
<p> The first thing concerning the Google app you can do is clear its cache. Once you remove locally-stored cached data, Google Now should start working. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to clear cache from the Google app: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Then, open App manager, Manage apps, or All apps (it depends on the phone’s OEM). </p>
<p> Now, locate and open Google from the list of apps. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Finally, clear cache from the app. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Restart Nova Launcher </p>
<p> Moving on, you can also try and just reboot your device. Alternatively, there’s an option in Nova Launcher to restart it. This is a long shot but it might help you resolve the problem at hand. </p>
<p> Tap & hold on the home screen and open Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll to the bottom and tap Advanced. </p>
<p> Tap Restart Nova Launcher. </p>
<p> If Google Now is still not working on Nova Launcher, make sure to continue to the last step below. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reset Google app </p>
<p> Finally, we can only suggest to completely reset the Google app. The best thing to do (the most thorough one) is to uninstall all updates from the app and start from scratch. Just wait until it auto-updates (or update it through the Play Store manually) and open it again. </p>
<p> Configure in Google > hamburger bar > Settings what’s necessary first. Then, disable/re-enable Nova Google Companion and everything should be addressed. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to reset the Google app completely: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for and expand Google. </p>
<p> Uninstall Google (this will uninstall updates since the Google app is a system app). </p>
<p> Reboot your device and update the app. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and, in case you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> How to keep Nova Launcher in memory </p>
<p> Nova Launcher Prime is one of those apps that, years after being purchased, keeps on giving. Many users run the non-premium version and still rate it above many other third-party launchers. However, this feature-rich custom launcher is not perfect. Some users have had a hard time with it, as their Android devices won’t keep Nova Launcher in RAM memory. </p>
<p> This results in longer-than-usual loading speeds on the home screen. Some users also reported issues with RAM management, when Nova uses up to 600 MB of RAM (normally, it should use no more than 200 with integrations). We made sure to list a few applicable solutions to address this without too much hassle. </p>
<p> Nova Launcher doesn’t stay in the memory </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Make sure Nova is the default launcher </p>
<p> The first thing you should do is just restart your device. Chances are this will fix the problem with Nova Launcher and keep it in memory in order to avoid constant redrawing. </p>
<p> If restarting didn’t help, you need to ensure that Nova Launcher is your default launcher. It might be that the system defaults on its own to stock launcher so it is really important to make Nova Launcher the default one. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to set Nova as your default launcher: </p>
<p> Open Settings and, in the search bar, type Launcher and open Default Launcher. </p>
<p> Under the Default launcher, select Nova Launcher. </p>
<p> Restart your device and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check all permissions </p>
<p> An app with such a wide usage on Android, as custom launchers, requires a lot of different permissions in order for everything to work as intended. Now, you don’t have to grant permissions you don’t feel safe giving, but remember that this will either limit certain features or affect the way the launcher is running on your device. </p>
<p> In addition, we suggest disabling RAM and Battery optimization for Nova Launcher in System Settings. </p>
<p> Here’s what to do in order to ensure Nova has all necessary permissions granted: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps > All apps. </p>
<p> Open Nova Launcher from the list of all apps. </p>
<p> Open Permissions. Some Android custom skins have Other permissions, as well. Don’t forget to access that menu as well. </p>
<p> Grant all permissions to Nova and reboot your device. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t help, navigate to Settings > Security > Special apps access (or Special access apps) and grant Nova Notification access, Display over other apps, and Usage access permissions. </p>
<p> Here’s how to restart Launcher and enable restarting of widgets in order to lower the redrawing time: </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Home Screen to open Nova Launcher Menu. </p>
<p> Select Settings. </p>
<p> Tap and hold the Volume down button to bring up the Labs menu. </p>
<p> Once there, enable the Restart widgets on resume option. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll to the bottom and expand Advanced. </p>
<p> Tap Restart Nova Launcher. </p>
<p> Alternatively, clear cache and data and start from scratch. Of course, before clearing data, make sure to back up your Nova configuration. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from Nova Launcher: </p>
<p> Open Nova settings from the Home Screen. </p>
<p> Select Backup & import settings. </p>
<p> Back up Nova configuration either locally or upload it to Drive. </p>
<p> Once you’ve done that, navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Nova Launcher. There, open Storage and clear cache and data from the app. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Prevent the stock launcher from working in the background </p>
<p> Now, even though Nova Launcher is set as the default launcher, what we want to do is disable the system (stock) launcher from working in the background. Stock launchers, like Pixel or MIUI System launcher, will read notifications in the background and, potentially, disrupt Nova Launcher. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reinstall the launcher </p>
<p> Finally, if after 4 steps, you still can’t keep Nova Launcher in memory and it’s frequently redrawing for a couple of seconds whenever you go to the home screen, you can reinstall the app. After removing Nova, download it again, load your back up, and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Additionally, we recommend leaving the Beta program for Nova Launcher. Although usually stable, Beta releases are not as stable as the public release. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share your questions or suggestions with us. You can do so in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/nova-launcher-notifications-not-working" parent_folder="web1" id="file17842531" filename="nova-launcher-notifications-not-working">
<p> Fix: Notifications not working on Nova Launcher </p>
<p> There are a lot of good custom launchers these days but Nova Launcher is probably the most popular out there. The level of customization and the sheer plethora of features include notification badges (premium feature). However, it seems that notifications are not working on Nova Launcher for some users, as badges are not shown on apps. </p>
<p> We made sure to shed some light on this problem and suggest a few applicable solutions below. </p>
<p> No notification badges on Nova Launcher Prime </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Uninstall Tesla Unread </p>
<p> Tesla Unread is (or rather was) a companion app for Nova Launcher that brought numeric badges to Android. These days, due to certain permissions it requires, it’s not available on the Play Store anymore. You can still download it from the Tesla Coil’s website, here. </p>
<p> Now, Tesla Coil incorporated numeric dots (along with simple Oreo-like dots and dynamic badges) in the launcher itself. The problem is: they won’t stick after the notification is dismissed as it is the case with Tesla Unread. </p>
<p> Also, you’ll need Nova Launcher Prime (paid version) in order to utilize badges. This is, in my honest opinion, money well spent considering this is the most popular and arguably the most feature-rich launcher for Android. </p>
<p> So, to cut the long story short, we suggest uninstalling Tesla Unread as it might have issues functioning properly on Android 10 (even on Pie). </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Inspect Nova Launcher settings and restart the launcher </p>
<p> Now, let’s ensure that numeric dots (or alternative badges) are properly enabled along with necessary permissions. After that, make sure to restart the launcher for the things to apply properly. </p>
<p> Obviously, Nova Launcher requires Notification permission in order for badges to work. With that said, here’s how to select and enable preferred Notification Badges in Nova Launcher: </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Home Screen to open Nova Launcher Menu. </p>
<p> Select Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Notification badges. </p>
<p> Tap on the Permission prompt at the bottom and grant Notification permission to Nova. </p>
<p> Select preferred badges and get back to the main Settings menu. </p>
<p> Scroll to the bottom and expand Advanced. </p>
<p> Tap Restart Nova Launcher. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Make sure Nova is your default launcher </p>
<p> Certain custom Android skins impose aggressive limitations on third-party services. They tend to limit their work in the background which, for a system-wide app as a launcher, leads to issues. </p>
<p> So, ensure that Nova Launcher is set as your default launcher. That should resolve the issues with notifications not showing or missing notification badges from certain apps. Of course, if there’s a particular app that won’t work, ensure that all notifications are enabled. You can do so by navigating to Settings > Apps > Notifications. </p>
<p> Open Settings and, in the search bar, type Launcher and open Default Launcher. </p>
<p> Under the Default launcher, select Nova Launcher. </p>
<p> Restart your device and test notifications to see whether notification badges appear. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Disable Battery optimization </p>
<p> On the same note, aggressive battery optimization might limit certain features of Nova Launcher. That’s why we recommend checking whether the launcher is allowed to auto-start and not being restrained by the persistent battery saving. </p>
<p> Here’s how to make Nova Launcher battery optimization-proof in a few simple steps: </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Select All apps (App manager or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Once there, locate Nova Launcher and open it. </p>
<p> Open Permissions and grant all necessary permissions. </p>
<p> Get back and open Battery optimization. </p>
<p> Exclude Nova from all optimization options. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reinstall Nova Launcher </p>
<p> The next step, in case the previous solutions weren’t of use, is to reinstall Nova Launcher. By reinstalling the app, you’ll clear the data and cache that might get corrupt. Also, you’ll get the latest working version. No need to uninstall the licensing app which is Nova Launcher Prime. </p>
<p> In addition, before installing the launcher again from the Play Store, we recommend leaving the Beta program. Of course, if you are already participating in beta testing for the app. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to reinstall Nova Launcher on Android: </p>
<p> Open Nova settings again from the Home Screen. </p>
<p> Select Backup & import settings. </p>
<p> Back up Nova configuration either locally or upload it to Drive. </p>
<p> From the Nova Settings menu, tap Select default launcher. </p>
<p> Choose System launcher as the default one. </p>
<p> Then open Play Store and uninstall Nova Launcher. </p>
<p> Restart your device and reinstall Nova from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Finally, restore your backup and, just in case, check the Notification badges section once again. Grant Notification permission again if asked. Finally, set Nova as the default launcher. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Update Android firmware </p>
<p> Finally, make sure to keep your phone’s firmware up-to-date. You might experience issues with Nova on older versions of Android, as the app is progressively optimized for a few latest Android iterations. </p>
<p> That should do it. Thank you for reading and, in case you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to tell us in the comments section below. </p>
<p> 5 COMMENTS </p>
<p> I have a Xiaomi and have an issue where the notification badges work for a very short while and then default back to demanding I enable Nova permission even though it already has. I’ve followed every step here and every step that Nova support have suggested and yet it’s still happening. Super frustrating. </p>

<p> Fix: Nova Launcher widgets not working </p>
<p> Nova Launcher is probably the one app that’s definitely, sooner or later, brought up when it comes to Android UI theming and customization. And, of course, like any other stock launcher, it allows home screen widgets. Not for all users, though, as there are reports that Nova Launcher widgets are not working for some. </p>
<p> If Nova can’t create (add) widgets or widgets are not updating, make sure to follow our instructions below to resolve these problems. </p>
<p> Widgets are not updating on Nova Launcher </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Remove and add the widget again </p>
<p> Firstly, if the widget is static and not updating, you should remove it and add it again from the widget menu. If there’s an option within the app to configure its widget, make sure to check for update frequency availability. </p>
<p> Once you remove the widget, add it again from the Widgets menu, reboot your device. If the problem persists, move to the next step. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check Nova and apps permissions </p>
<p> In order for Nova Launcher to create widgets, you’ll need to grant it certain permissions. You are usually prompted to grant this particular permission upon installing the launcher and adding widgets for the first time. </p>
<p> In addition, the base apps (the ones that widgets belong to) need permissions as well. This has a special emphasis on Android 10 which deals with per-app permission in a more strict manner. </p>
<p> So, here are some things you should check out in order to fix Nova Launcher widgets that are not working: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps > Nova Launcher and grant all necessary permissions. You can also enable Nova Launcher Labs settings and find permissions there. </p>
<p> Do the same for the app that provides the widget but won’t update (weather apps, step trackers, etc.). </p>
<p> Open Nova Launcher settings and hold Volume down key to open the Labs option. Open Labs and check the “Restart widgets on resume” box. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Make sure Nova is the default launcher </p>
<p> Some custom Android skins (many of them, actually) tend to aggressively limit the activity of the third-party apps. There are battery optimization and those pesky Phone Managers that can restrict apps from working in the background or updating. This applies to widgets of those respective apps. </p>
<p> So, make sure to set Nova as the default launcher, whitelist both Nova and widget apps and disable battery optimization for those services. Follow these instructions to do so: </p>
<p> Open Settings and, in the search bar, type Launcher and open Default Launcher. </p>
<p> Under the Default launcher, select Nova Launcher. </p>
<p> Restart your device and test notifications to see whether notification badges appear. </p>
<p> Now, navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps and select Nova and other apps respectively. Enable Autostart for Nova and all included apps (the ones that provide widgets) and disable Battery optimization. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall Nova, clear cache and update affected apps </p>
<p> Finally, if widgets are still not working on Nova Launcher despite the aforementioned steps, we recommend starting from scratch. First, you should reinstall Nova. Secondly, try clearing cache and data from apps related to widgets. And, in the end, ensure that apps are up to date. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do, step-by-step: </p>
<p> Open individual app settings (as explained above), select Storage, and clear cache and data. You can reinstall those apps, as well. </p>
<p> Open Nova settings from the Home Screen. </p>
<p> Select Backup & import settings. </p>
<p> Back up Nova configuration either locally or upload it to Drive. </p>
<p> From the Nova Settings menu, tap Select default launcher. </p>
<p> Choose System launcher as the default one. </p>
<p> Then open Play Store and uninstall Nova Launcher. </p>
<p> Restart your device and reinstall Nova from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Make it the default launcher, add widgets again, and look for improvements. </p>
<p> On that note, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and make sure to leave your feedback in the comments section below. It is more than welcome. </p>

<p> Fix: OK Google doesn’t work after Android Oreo update </p>
<p> Android Oreo is finally here for some Pixel and Nexus devices. While Google promises the new Android version will improve the overall performance of your phone, it appears that’s not exactly the case. Because people have already encountered various issues caused by Android O. </p>
<p> According to some reports, Android Oreo breaks the OK Google feature on some devices. Even though everything was fine in Android Nougat, users are now unable to perform some sound commands. </p>
<p> I’ve searched online for potential solutions, and as it appears, there’s a way to fix the problem. Unlike some other issues, that users basically have to wait for Google to fix them through updates. So, Let’s see what can we do about OK Google issues in Android O. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Retrain OK Google </p>
<p> The solution that helped the majority of Android users with the OK Google problem is simply retraining the assistant. It looks like installing the update somehow disrupted the assistant, so retraining is needed. </p>
<p> In case you’re not sure how to retrain Google Assistant, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Go to Apps & notifications > expand Advanced > Default apps > Assist & voice input </p>
<p> Tap the settings (gear) icon next to Assist app </p>
<p> Go to “Ok Google” detection </p>
<p> Now, choose Delete voice model, to reset Google Now settings </p>
<p> After that, choose Retrain voice model </p>
<p> Finish the training </p>
<p> That’s all. After re-training your assistant, Google Now should be working seamlessly once again. However, if re-training didn’t get the job done, move on to the next solution. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check your language settings </p>
<p> There’s also a slight chance installing Android Oreo corrupted your language settings. So, check if your Voice language matches your system language, to be sure Google Now will work well. </p>
<p> To check Voice language settings, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Go to Apps & notifications > expand Advanced > Default apps > Assist & voice input </p>
<p> Tap the settings (gear) icon next to Assist app </p>
<p> Tap Languages </p>
<p> Make sure the right language is selected </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Check for updates </p>
<p> And finally, maybe the update itself disrupt Google Now, with some internal bug. That’s not the case with the Nexus and Pixel devices, but could be with other manufacturers (this article was written at the time when only Nexus and Pixel devices had Android Oreo). </p>
<p> If the update indeed caused the problem, Google will eventually acknowledge the issue, and release a fixing patch. So, if you’ve tried both of the abovementioned solutions, and still have problems with Google Now assistant, make sure your phone is up to date. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I certainly hope at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the problem with OK Google after installing the Oreo update. If not, let me know in the comments below, or reach me out on Twitter. </p>

<p> Yeah I have a G5 and my ok google has stopped as well…Really sucks when your job is driving for a living … TRIED EVERYTHING so frustrated </p>
<p> I have the Oreo 8.0 in a brand new Xiaomi A1 and ok Google is not an option. It appears in light grey, can’t turn on and when the system suggested me to use it, I clicked on it and the same as some users in the comments happened: connection fail… Me wifi works just fine. I can’t retrain it 🙁 </p>
<p> O have the same problem in xiaomi mi a1 if you can fix that text me the solution please </p>

<p> I am using a Cubot X18 running Android 7 and everything was running perfectly, including the new ‘Hey Google’ Google Assistant feature. The Google app was updated and I suddenly noticed that voice commands were not working anymore. I tried to retrain the voice but although it was asking me to say ‘Ok Google’ the voice training wasn’t being accepted. The actual part of the menu where you turned the Google Assistant on was greyed out. As a last resort I uninstalled the latest update and then the phone would let me retrain the voice which gave me back ‘Ok… Read more » </p>

<p> How to use OK Google when the screen is off </p>
<p> Sure, keeping Google Assistant on all the time is not exactly great for your privacy and security. It puts you at constant risk of someone else unlocking your phone just by imitating your voice. </p>
<p> But being able to activate Google Assistant at any time is so convenient. People are so used to communicating with their phones while their hands are busy that they don’t mind any security risks. And even though turning on the screen is a small extra step, it’s still an extra step. It’s surprisingly hard to do that extra step if you’re “programmed” otherwise. </p>
<p> So, unlocking your phone with the screen off should be as easy as saying “OK Google”, right? Wrong! It’s much more complicated than that. At least for some people. Because not all phones are created equal, and not all phones are supposed to allow you to unlock them with your voice. </p>
<p> If you’re lucky enough to own a device that natively supports the voice unlock, the configuration process is as simple as it gets. You just need to enable the option to unlock your screen with Voice Match, and that’s it. But if your phone doesn’t support this feature, you can’t really use Google Assistant with the screen off “the right way”. </p>
<p> But which phones support this by default? Well, that’s hard to tell. Google’s own Pixel devices should have this feature, as well as some older Nexus phones, but I also managed to get it working on my Pocophone F1 without any shenanigans. You can also find various reports on the forums saying which phone supports it and which doesn’t. And Google not releasing the official statement also doesn’t help. </p>
<p> So, the only way to know if your phone supports OK Google when the screen is off is by checking the assistant settings. If you find the Unlock with Voice Match option in the settings, your phone supports this feature. If not, I’m sorry, but you’ll have to settle for other options. </p>
<p> Enable “Unlock with Voice Match” </p>
<p> For all you lucky ones who own a device that supports unlocking with Voice match, setting up this feature is straightforward. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Go to Google > Search, Assistant & Voice > Voice. </p>
<p> Tap Voice Match. </p>
<p> Enable the Unlock with Voice Match option. </p>
<p> That’s it. Now Google Assistant will listen all the time, even if the screen is off, and you’ll be able to unlock your phone with a simple voice command. </p>
<p> But if you don’t see this option, there’s no ‘real’ way around. So, if you really want to use Google Assistant when the screen is off, try some alternatives (if we can call them that) below. But keep in mind, these are far less convenient. </p>
<p> Android Auto </p>
<p> If you’re desperate enough to have Google Assistant with the screen off, there’s one unusual, less convenient solution that actually works. Android Auto allows you to use Assistant everywhere; it just needs to be running in the background all the time. </p>
<p> If you don’t have Android Auto pre-installed on your device, head over to the Play Store, and install it. Just set it up by allowing a few permissions and agreeing to a few terms, and you’re good to go. </p>
<p> As Android Auto is integrated with Google Assistant, and you shouldn’t be using your phone while driving, it allows you to interact with your device even when the screen is off. So, as long as you keep Android Auto running in the background, you’re covered. </p>
<p> The fact that Google Assistant is running through Android Auto doesn’t limit it one bit. You can still use all the commands and ask everything, not just for information about your “trip”. </p>
<p> The drawbacks are obvious here. First, the battery will drain faster with Android Auto running in the background. Then, Android Auto and Maps notifications will take a huge chunk of the notification drawer. And finally, you won’t be able to use Google Maps to the fullest. </p>
<p> But this can all be tweaked to some degree, in order to make Android Auto in the background as imperceptible as possible. </p>
<p> Although you can’t eliminate the battery drain completely, you can at least reduce it by optimizing Android Auto. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Apps & Notifications > Advanced > Special app access. </p>
<p> Tap Battery optimization. </p>
<p> Find Android Auto, tap it and choose Optimize. </p>
<p> Now that the battery usage is (to some degree) optimized, let’s declutter the notifications clutter. Pull down the notification drawer, and you’ll notice that Android Auto occupies more than half of the screen. Tap and hold each notification and choose Minimize. This will significantly reduce the space used by Android Auto notifications. They’ll still be there, but at least they won’t be as distracting. </p>
<p> For Google Maps, it will constantly run in car mode. You won’t be able to get walking routes, commute info, and other stuff. So, if you’re, for example, on a vacation, exploring a foreign city on foot, I recommend turning Android Auto off. </p>
<p> Bluetooth headphones </p>
<p> Many Bluetooth speakers and earbuds come with Google Assistant today. Which means you can use your Bluetooth earbuds to wake up Google Assistant any time. While it’s not as convenient as speaking directly to your phone, it’s still better taking it out of your pocket every time you need to check the weather forecast. </p>
<p> In case your phone doesn’t support your earbuds’ hotkey out of the box, you need to allow it to interact with Google Assistant when the device is locked. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Go to Google > Search, Assistant & Voice. </p>
<p> Tap Voice. </p>
<p> Enable Allow Bluetooth requests with device locked. </p>
<p> You’re not supposed to do this anymore </p>
<p> After all of this, you may ask why aren’t Google and OEMs in general happy about this feature? Well, the reason you’re not allowed to use your voice for unlocking your phone is strictly security-related. As I said above, voice unlock is probably the weakest security measure you can have on your phone, because it’s very gullible. </p>
<p> Anyone can try to imitate your voice. While the phone won’t unlock 9 times out of 10, it could the 10th time. Despite all the efforts and recent big improvements, the voice-recognition technology is simply not advanced enough to distinguish your voice from others with 100% accuracy. </p>
<p> Because of that, Google decided to limit this feature for your own sake. And that makes sense, especially in the age when everybody is concerned about their privacy and online security. </p>
<p> But users still object. And I’m with them. Android is Android because of the freedom it provides. People should be able to do what they want, even if it means sacrificing a little privacy. After all, no one is completely safe on the internet today. So, why don’t give them a choice? </p>
<p> 5 COMMENTS </p>
<p> While this article does tell you everything you need to know, it’s written in such a judgemental way, as if I should feel guilty for wanting the Google assistant to work while the is screen off. Like: “If you’re desperate enough to have Google Assistant with the screen off,” Again, it’s plenty helpful, but it left a bitter taste after reading. </p>

<p> If you want to make it a little more secure change the regular OK Google or hey Google unlock phrase to something that people wouldn’t normally think of using like listen up Google that way even if they do mimic your voice they won’t know the exact phrase you need to say to make it happen. you can change this when you record your voice for the unlock phone function </p>

<p> This is the only topic I found explaining exactly what I wanted to know (What makes some phones able to wakeup from screen off with Google assistant command and few are NOT). Thanks! After a tedious search for days </p>
<p> What I dont understand is why can Google assist always respond in the lock screen but won’t respond at all when the screen is off? Doesn’t make any sense. Where is the safety in that? Anyone can open the blank closed screen by hand in order to get to the locked screen to use Google assist if I set it up to “always open in lock screen” I used to call my phone “okay google” in order to find where in the house , purse, car etc. I placed it.

<p> Solved: OneDrive for Android app not syncing </p>
<p> All mass-used cloud-backup services on Android look alike. There’s Google Drive, then there’s Dropbox and finally OneDrive. Lots of others, too. OneDrive is somewhere in the middle with fairly affordable premium storages and better integration with Windows PCs. The issues surrounding OneDrive for Android are scarce, but they exist. There are reports concerning the OneDrive for Android app not syncing the local files. </p>
<p> We made sure to dissect this and provide you with steps to resolve the syncing problem. You can find them below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear app’s cache and data from OneDrive </p>
<p> Before we cover this first step, let’s focus on two important things. First, we need you to confirm that your Wi-Fi network works as intended. If you want to upload files over Mobile Data, you’ll need to enable this in OneDrive settings. </p>
<p> The second important thing is the storage. In comparison to Google Photos, OneDrive keeps the original lossless photos upon the upload. And photos tend to take a lot of space. And fast, too. </p>
<p> After dealing with those two, let’s start with the troubleshooting steps. The first and the most common way to resolve a minor bug or a temporary temper tantrum of an Android app is to clear its cache and data. This might, consequently, require a new sign in. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to clear cache and data from the OneDrive app: </p>
<p> Choose All apps. </p>
<p> Open OneDrive. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Rename the Photos folder </p>
<p> If you trust OneDrive over Google Photos for backing up camera roll photos, there’s a common bug which halts the upload process. Since the individual folder (usually called Camera Roll) is assigned to photo uploads, it indexes files inside everytime a new photo is ready to hit the cloud. And if you have a lot photos in this folder, well, it can take a while. </p>
<p> That’s why we suggest following these steps to avoid the sync problem with photos on OneDrive: </p>
<p> Open OneDrive. </p>
<p> Select the Camera Roll folder and rename it. </p>
<p> This will force OneDrive to create another Camera Roll folder. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Allow OneDrive to work in a background </p>
<p> In the current meta of Android, most of the old permissions are automatically declined and you need to allow an app to access everything during usage. At least, most of the time and for the non-Google apps. And some handsets, especially Huawei, tend to kill the background processes of intrusive apps. Or app the system deems intrusive. </p>
<p> With that in mind, we advise you to check all permissions for OneDrive and, in addition, keep it out of Phone Manager claws. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Apps & notifications. </p>
<p> Choose All apps. </p>
<p> Open OneDrive. </p>
<p> Open Permissions and allow all required permissions to OneDrive. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall the OneDrive app from the Play Store </p>
<p> Finally, the last place on this troubleshooting shortlist is reserved for the reinstallation. Now, at the first glance, this looks like a simple task. But most users forget about the Google Drive backup which stores all apps data backups. Or, in this case, the device will remember the account and restore it upon the installation. </p>
<p> That’s why we need to delete the account for OneDrive, uninstall the app, install it again, sign in and, hopefully (fingers crossed), the sync will start working. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose User & accounts. </p>
<p> That’s it. If you’re still unable to sync files to OneDrive on Android, make sure to send a feedback to Microsoft. There might be a large scale problem at hand and you should know about it. </p>
<p> Either way, feel free to share your solutions or questions in the comments section below. Maybe we missed something of importance. </p>

I’m not encouraged that at the OneDrive Support site for MS, it states, “The OneDrive app does not sync files automatically.” So, it seems they have once again decided that auto-sync is not something we need.

<p> Fix: OneDrive for Android not uploading photos </p>
<p> Since you get Google Drive by default with a Google account, there’s a little need for a casual user to use Microsoft OneDrive on their Android handset. But, that doesn’t mean that there are no advantages. Especially if you’re using a Windows PC too and want to sync files and photos between the two in a seamless manner. But there seems to be a problem with the Camera Roll photos. Apparently, OneDrive for Android has a hard time uploading photos. </p>
<p> We made sure to get shed light on this problem and help you resolve it. The solutions we provided are below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear cache </p>
<p> Let’s start with the simplest solution. As you’re already well aware, all apps store some portions of data on the local storage. Some of them take it to another level and store hundreds of megabytes. Others, like OneDrive, will take up to 200 MB, to speed up the loading. But, a pilled-up cache can be a reason for numerous issues. After a while, it does just a contrary. It slows down the app execution and it can affect the overall performance. </p>
<p> So, the first step should be clearing the locally-stored data and moving from there. Here’s how to clear the cached data from OneDrive: </p>
<p> Choose All apps. </p>
<p> Open OneDrive. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check the permissions </p>
<p> Like any other app, OneDrive requires a certain level of access to your device. After Android Marshmallow, these permissions prompts are appearing as you’re using the app. Only when a permission is strictly required for a certain operation, the pop-up will appear and you can choose to accept it or not. And there’s a chance you’ve skipped on the Storage or Camera permissions. </p>
<p> Here’s how to check them out and enable both, respectively: </p>
<p> Select All apps. </p>
<p> Locate and open OneDrive. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Rename the Camera Roll folder </p>
<p> Another viable solution is to start from scratch. Re-configure the app completely and change the Camera Roll folder. We don’t want to delete it, of course. But, if you’ve collected a lot of photos from your camera, chances are that caching this photos with every new sync invokes a halt. That’s why the best way to deal with it is to simply change the folder and start syncing your camera-taken photos to a new Camera Roll folder. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do, step-by-step: </p>
<p> Open OneDrive. </p>
<p> Select the Camera Roll folder and rename it. </p>
<p> This will force OneDrive to create another Camera Roll folder. </p>
<p> If this doesn’t help and the issue is persistent, check the final step below. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall the app </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the aforementioned steps get you going and the photos still won’t sync, you can always try and reinstall the app. In addition, you should remove the OneDrive-assigned account and set everything up again. After that, you should be able to sync photos to OneDrive without any further issues. </p>
<p> This should be a simple task to follow through, so check the steps below: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose User & accounts. </p>
<p> Remove the OneDrive account. </p>
<p> With that, we can conclude this article. If, by chance, you know any alternative solution we overlooked or have additional issues, feel free to share your two cents in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Microsoft adds features constantly, but NEVER EVER takes the time to ensure basic functionality is working reliably. OneDrive camera sync on Android has had issues for almost 50 years now, and they still have no clue how to fix it. </p>

<p> OnePlus 6 common problems, and how to solve them </p>
<p> The Chinese OnePlus slowly but steadily took over the fruitful middle ground between the mid-range handsets and $800+ flagships. And its latest smartphone, the OnePlus 6, has the best of both worlds thus some call it The Flagship Killer. </p>
<p> It’s an affordable but highly-efficient handset with the close-to-stock Android (Oxygen OS) and remarkable hardware. Also, the support is as good as one could expect from an OEM, so every major issue is usually solved in a matter of weeks, if not days. However, that doesn’t mean that there are no issues on the OnePlus 6. Cause there are. </p>
<p> We decided to enlist the common problems easily found on the official forum, and provide you with fitting solutions. If you are a proud owner of this handset, the list below might help you resolve possible issues you’ve encountered over time. </p>
<p> 1: Battery drains </p>
<p> Let’s start with the most commonly reported problem for this handset. Now, based on reports we read, the problem occurred mostly after the upgrade to Android Pie 9.0. Of course, there are some reports about the similar issue on the previous releases, including the Beta versions of the said Android OS or even on a stable version of Oreo. </p>
<p> There are various ways to reduce the battery drainage, especially when the device is idle overnight. Here are some suggestions for you: </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> Disable some background apps. You can navigate to Settings > Battery and find out which one is causing the battery depletion. </p>
<p> Disable Mobile Data Always On in Developer options. </p>
<p> Use Greenify or any other third-party application to limit the background processes. </p>
<p> Remove the unused widgets. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi overnight. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings and restore all files from the backup. </p>
<p> 2: Overheating </p>
<p> Overheating is another grave problem, especially if left unattended. There are various reason why your device would overheat, starting with the extensive usage for the prolonged period of time while charging and reaching the software-based bugs in battery calibration. Either way, there seems that this, overall amazing handset, is somewhat prone to overheating from the get-go. </p>
<p> If that’s the case for you, we suggest following these steps to mitigate the overheating: </p>
<p> Don’t use your device while charging. </p>
<p> Update the OS. </p>
<p> Remove the casing temporarily. </p>
<p> Set the Deep clear option in Recent App Management settings. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Boot the device in Safe mode and look for changes. </p>
<p> Reset the OnePlus 6 to factory settings. </p>
<p> 3: Notification issues </p>
<p> The importance of timely-distributed notification is the core feature for every smartphone since their uprise more than a decade ago. And that core feature seems to be faulty for some OnePlus 6 users. They either experienced a noticeable notification delay or push notifications aren’t coming through at all. </p>
<p> This is obviously a major issue and we provided you with some ways to resolve it: </p>
<p> Reset Apps preferences. </p>
<p> Disable Do not disturb mode. </p>
<p> Clear cache in the affected apps. </p>
<p> Allow Notifications in Apps & notification settings. </p>
<p> Disable Battery optimization for the affected app/apps. </p>
<p> Disable Gaming mode. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 4: Brightness issues </p>
<p> Automatic brightness based on the ambient sensor is another core part of contemporary devices. However, some users have provided valuable input regarding the brightness. Namely, some of them are having a hard time with the automatic brightness which is either erratically flickering or dims the brightness too much. </p>
<p> We have a few ways to resolve this, so make sure to check them below: </p>
<p> Disable Adaptive brightness and toggle the brightness manually. </p>
<p> Use a third-party tool to regulate the screen brightness. Some of them are quite proficient in replacing the built-in tool. </p>
<p> Update your system. </p>
<p> 5: Fingerprint scanner and Face Unlock issues </p>
<p> Fingerprint reader biometrics have been established as the go-to security measure. The fingerprint reader is the fastest way to unlock your device, with the face unlock being a less safe exception. Nonetheless, some OnePlus 6 users were experiencing the slight delay while unlocking or the fingerprint scanner was completely unresponsive until they wake up the screen. </p>
<p> In addition, the built-in Face Unlock feature seems rather slow after the system update to Android Pie 9.0. The affected users stated that the, once fast, Face Unlock got substantially slower. </p>
<p> Here’s what to do if the fingerprint scanner/face unlock starts misbehaving on the OnePlus 6: </p>
<p> Re-configure the fingerprint and set a new Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Try booting into Safe mode and, if the fingerprint and IR scanner perform better, uninstall all recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Remove the tempered glass or cases which may cover the fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Clean the fingerprint sensor from a debris and greasy dirt with a wet cloth. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory values. In most occasions, we suggest restoring your device from a backup afterward. In this case, we suggest starting clean. </p>
<p> 6: Crashes and lags </p>
<p> Even though issues like these should be at the top of the list, they’re, frankly, quite rare on the OnePlus 6. With the amazing hardware capabilities and well-optimized Oxygen OS, you’ll rarely experience any slowdowns on the day-to-day basis. </p>
<p> However, even this great device, which is on par with the Pixel 2 in regards to snappy behavior and seamless animations, can run into a roadblock or two from time to time. But, more times than not, the problem is either in a third-party app or in an unoptimized system update. </p>
<p> Here’s what to do if you run into lags, freezes, or crashes on the OnePlus 6: </p>
<p> Clear cache from the app which freezes the most. </p>
<p> Disable apps from working in the background. Greenify should serve the purpose. </p>
<p> Update your device for a possible update fix. </p>
<p> Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 7: In-Call issues </p>
<p> There are multiple reported problems regarding calls. Some users stated that the call drops suddenly, while others have issues when switching to a loudspeaker during the call. The ones with less luck can’t even make calls after the device is restarted or the phone won’t ring. These are serious issues, but we can safely write them off as bugs in the initial Android Pie 9.0 release. The upcoming patches will fix this, so no need to worry. </p>
<p> On the other hand, while you’re waiting, can we suggest some of the workarounds which might help you address issues at hand: </p>
<p> Reset the Phone/Dialer app’s cache. </p>
<p> Reboot the device. </p>
<p> Remove the SIM card from the compartment and place it again. </p>
<p> 8: Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> The Wi-Fi seems to be a problem for some, as well. It seems that the Wi-Fi tends to disconnect or the connection isn’t as solid as it was before the update. The problem is easily distinguishable in the online games, where the network drops are quite common for some users. </p>
<p> We have a few ideas on how to address this, so make sure to check them out below: </p>
<p> Delete all networks and try reconnecting. </p>
<p> Disable Always On for Mobile Data in Developer options. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Reset App preferences. </p>
<p> 9: Screen blackout and flickers at the bottom </p>
<p> This is one of the major hardware problems for this handset. However, the number of affected users is so small so we don’t want to make it look like something you can expect when acquiring this device. </p>
<p> This is, almost certainly, a hardware problem. You might try to connect your phone to PC and reset it to factory values with the ADB. However, the least cumbersome way to deal with this is to contact the service and ask for the replacement. Avoid repairing and get a new handset. </p>
<p> 10: Camera and Video player issues </p>
<p> Both front and back camera performance seemingly dropped after the update. Photos come out blurry, especially in the low-light conditions. In addition, some users have had issues with the built-in video player, as the camera-taken video’s framerate was ludicrously low during the playback. Also, the reproduction of the video format doesn’t work on PCs for some users. </p>
<p> If you have these or similar camera-related issues on the OnePlus 6, we encourage you to try these steps: </p>
<p> Boot into Safe mode and test the camera. </p>
<p> Clear Camera app’s data. </p>
<p> Update the device. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 11: Sound issues </p>
<p> We already mentioned some in-call sound issues, but that’s not where the sound-related issues stop for some users. The sound quality during the media reproduction downgraded a lot after the Android Pie update. </p>
<p> Here’s what you can try in order to improve the sound on your OnePlus 6: </p>
<p> Disable absolute volume in Developer options. </p>
<p> If the sound issues emerge in video streaming apps (e.g. YouTube), reset the app to factory settings and try again. </p>
<p> Use a medical alcohol and cloth to clear the mic and speaker. After that, you can use a compressed air to remove all debris. </p>
<p> Boot your device in a Safe mode and test the speaker both with media files and in calls. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> 12: Bluetooth bug </p>
<p> Even there’s the 3.5-inch jack for the headphones, this doesn’t undermine the fact that the Bluetooth is essential for some users. And, seemingly, there’s a bug with the Bluetooth which causes the phone to disconnect from the paired devices. </p>
<p> This is a software bug and it can be resolved with a few tweaks. Here’s what you should do: </p>
<p> Remove pairing and establish it again. Navigate to Settings >Bluetooth and delete all paired devices. Pair the handset with the device again and try again. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> Disable Automatic pairing. Pair individually with a device when you want to use it. </p>
<p> Boot into a safe mode and try connecting via Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Update the system. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> 13: System update to Android Pie deletes all files </p>
<p> And the final issue is, by no means, the least important. Namely, some users reported that the Android Pie 9.0 update deleted all their data. After the restart, they were met with the basic factory configuration, missing everything stored on the internal storage prior to the update. That’s a reason more for all of you to back up your data before a major update. </p>
<p> We can suggest restoring your app data from the Google Drive where it was backed up. The same goes for photos and Google Photos. Sadly, some of the other multimedia files and configuration files can’t be restored. </p>
<p> 14: Advanced troubleshooting steps for OnePlus 6 </p>
<p> Access Developer options </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open System settings. </p>
<p> Choose About phone. </p>
<p> Locate the build number and tap on it 7 times to enable the Developer options menu. </p>
<p> Safe mode </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button until the Power menu appears. </p>
<p> Tap Restart. </p>
<p> Immediately after the handset turns on, press and hold the Volume Down key until the OnePlus logo appears. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu in the top right corner and tap Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Turn Off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold Power and Volume keys simultaneously until the OnePlus logo appears. </p>
<p> By using the Volume keys, select English and choose “Wipe data and cache”. </p>
<p> Choose Wipe cache. </p>
<p> Press the Power key to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings from Recovery </p>
<p> Turn Off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold Power and Volume keys simultaneously until the OnePlus logo appears. </p>
<p> By using the Volume keys, select English and choose “Wipe data and cache”. </p>
<p> Select Erase everything. </p>
<p> Your device will reboot after the procedure. </p>
<p> With those instructions, we come to an end. If you’re aware of any other OnePlus 6 issues or have some questions regarding the ones presented, we encourage you to share them with us. The comments section is just below so feel free to share your thoughts. </p>

<p> Fix: Android Oreo Picture-in-Picture mode not working </p>
<p> Even though Android P (Peppermint is our best guess at the moment) is still in the development phase, Oreo is still the latest Android iteration. When it came out, it had some valuable additions but, seemingly, one of the most-promoted feature, PiP, is still having some issues. </p>
<p> Namely, a lot of Oreo 8.0 and 8.1 users are still experiencing various issues with Picture-in-picture mode. For that purpose, we prepared a list of solutions which should address the most common issues with the PiP mode. Make sure to check them out below. </p>
<p> Solution 1: Check the permission and compatibility </p>
<p> Firstly, let’s start with the prerequisites. Even though it got its share of hype when Oreo was introduced, PiP (Picture-in-Picture mode) isn’t all that special. Don’t get us wrong, we’re talking about more than a welcomed novelty, just there’s rather limited number of applications which support PiP. In order to play YouTube videos from the app (most common usage for this mode), you’ll need the YouTube Red subscription. Which isn’t an option for a lot of countries. </p>
<p> And that’s the main purpose of this app, in our humble opinion. Yes, you have other streaming services, but YouTube is probably what most users use to enjoy videos. So, the first thing you should do is to check the permissions and compatibility of the given app before we move to additional steps. The supported first-party apps are YouTube (with Red subscription), Chrome, Duo, and Maps. </p>
<p> The Picture-in-Picture mode has its own option within the Settings, so make sure that the compatible apps are enabled. Here’s how to do it in a few steps: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Picture-in-picture. </p>
<p> Make sure all compatible apps from the list are enabled. </p>
<p> Restart your device and give it another try. </p>
<p> Solution 2: Clear app’s cache </p>
<p> Another viable step you should take when addressing any app issues is clearing cache. After some time of extensive use, apps tend to pile up the cached data in order to speed up the loading process. </p>
<p> Since clearing cache in Android Oreo is different than in other versions of the OS, you can learn more about it in this article. </p>
<p> Solution 3: Update the device and apps </p>
<p> Making sure that all your apps and the device’s firmware are up to date is paramount. In Developer Previews of Oreo, a lot of apps had issues. However, we’re long past these issues since the final stable version fixed most of the issues. On the other hand, certain supported third-party apps are still revisited and patched on regular basis. </p>
<p> When it comes to device’s firmware, making sure that you have all patches should be of utmost importance. Most of the updates are provided in the automatized manner, but it won’t hurt to check for updates manually. In addition, make sure that the affected app isn’t in the Beta-testing variation. Those are buggy and unreliable. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap System updates. </p>
<p> Tap Check. </p>
<p> And, these instructions are for updating apps over Play Store: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Tap on the hamburger menu and choose “My apps & games”. </p>
<p> Check for updates and update all relevant apps. </p>
<p> Solution 4: Play YouTube via Chrome </p>
<p> Finally, we can’t wrap this app without offering a simple workaround for users that can’t (or won’t) obtain the YouTube Red subscription. You can still stream YouTube videos on your Android and use a nifty PiP mode. </p>
<p> Just, instead of using the YouTube app itself, you can utilize Chrome’s Desktop mode and play any video in the Picture-in-Picture mode. Here’s how to do it in a few simple steps: </p>
<p> Open Chrome. </p>
<p> Open YouTube clip you want to play and click on the 3-dot menu in the top right corner. </p>
<p> Check the Desktop site box. </p>
<p> Once you’ve done that, expand a video to full screen and click on the Home button. </p>
<p> That’s it. Now you should be able to adjust position and control playback as you wish. </p>
<p> That’s a wrap. Don’t forget to share additional solutions or ask questions about the presented ones. You can do so in the comments section below. </p>

<p> My phone is Nokia 3.1. It uses android oreo 8.1. I have an issue with picture in picture mode in most apps supported this mode like chrome, firefox, youtube. It switchs from full screen to picture in picture mode without touching screen or pressing any button like home or any others. It’s really frustrated because it keeps change to picture in picture mode without any of my intention. I try to reinstall several times these apps and soft restart my phone but it didn’t work. I end up turning off this feature because it starts inconvient and trouble. And more… Read more » </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/outlook-not-syncing" parent_folder="web1" id="file17848824" filename="outlook-not-syncing">
<p> Fix: Outlook not syncing on Android </p>
<p> Microsofts Android suite gained a lot of popularity as the Redmond giant invest more in the development of apps like Microsoft Outlook. And the app is usually good, for some probably better than Google’s Gmail. However, some users are bothered by quite a debilitating error, as Outlook for Android is not syncing. </p>
<p> Learn how to fix this with the instructions below. </p>
<p> How do I sync my Android with Outlook? </p>
<p> This is usually done automatically as soon as you add and configure your account in Outlook. However, as we are obviously looking at an error, it is suggested to check the connection, reset your account or, eventually, rollback the app to an older bug-less version. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check the connection </p>
<p> The first thing to do is to ensure that your device is connected to a stable Wi-Fi. Inspect the connection and see whether any other app suffers from network issues. If the problem is isolated to Outlook, then you can move to another step. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you have connectivity issues in general, try these steps: </p>
<p> Reboot your phone/tablet and your wireless router. </p>
<p> Enable Airplane mode for a couple of minutes. Disable it, connect to a network, and try syncing emails again. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Reset the account </p>
<p> The Outlook app offers a built-in reset option if emails are not syncing. You can find it in the individual account settings within the app. Once you reset the account, it will restart the syncing process and, hopefully, fix the problem for good. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reset Outlook account: </p>
<p> Open Outlook. </p>
<p> Tap on the hamburger menu and then on the cog-like Settings icon. </p>
<p> Open the Microsoft account that won’t sync. </p>
<p> Scroll down and tap Reset Account. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Remove and add the account again </p>
<p> Moving forward. Of course, in case you still weren’t able to resolve the sync issue, you can try and remove the account. Along with that, you can navigate to Outlook in a web browser and remove the Android device from the Sync list. </p>
<p> In order to do so, follow the steps from the previous solution just, instead of Reset, tap Delete Account. Add the account again afterward and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall Outlook </p>
<p> If the previous steps weren’t of any help, let’s reinstall the app and give it another go. Usually, Microsoft tends to its Play Store apps but there might be a bug at the current version. If that’s indeed the case, the reinstallation should fix it for good. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reinstall Outlook on Android: </p>
<p> Open the Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for Outlook and expand the Microsoft Outlook: Organize Your Email & Calendar app. </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall and restart your device. </p>
<p> Now, open any browser, navigate here, and sign in with the affected Outlook/Hotmail account. </p>
<p> Under the Mobile device in the left pane, locate your device, highlight it and click on the minus sign (-) to delete it. </p>
<p> After that, just install Outlook again, add your account, and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Download an older APK version of Outlook </p>
<p> Finally, if you are still stuck with Outlook not syncing, you can rollback the app by installing an APK from APK Mirror (or any other APK aggregate of your choice). There’s definitely something flawed with the current version so, by installing an older version, Outlook should be able to sync emails successfully. </p>
<p> Here’s how to download and install an Outlook APK on your phone or tablet: </p>
<p> Uninstall Microsoft Outlook as explained above. </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror, here, or any other APK hub online. </p>
<p> Download an older APK version but not older than two months. </p>
<p> Grant permission to install apps from untrusted sources. </p>
<p> Install the APK and give it a go. </p>
<p> And on that note, we can wrap it up. Thank you for reading and be kind to share the results of troubleshooting with us in the comments section below. </p>
<p> I think I’ve found the problem. Try this : Go to Battery optimization, and DISABLE the optimization for all “Outlook” and “Authenticator” (if you have it). As soon as I did this, all emails synced again without doind any reset or reboot. </p>
<p> I was able to fix my issue but checking the “All Mail” – “Show in IMAP” under labels. </p>

<p> Method 2 is no longer applicable. Although the account settings screen says “Sync issues? Try resetting you account”, there is no Reset button anymore, just the Delete Account button. </p>

<p> Phone not charging after Android 9 Pie upgrade: What to do? </p>
<p> Android 9 Pie brings a handful of useful improvements to an already well-established ecosystem. Enhanced gestures, adaptive brightness and battery are just some new features that Pie users can take advantage of. </p>
<p> But the transition isn’t as flawless for everyone, as some users can’t enjoy the new features without sacrificing some functionality. And I don’t mean in a way it’s meant to be. </p>
<p> One of the more common problems that’s arisen is the charging issue. Namely, users have reported that they’re unable to charge their devices properly after upgrading to Android 9 Pie. So, I’ll try to explain what’s going on and how can you potentially resolve this problem. </p>
<p> Sure, I can tell you to try some common solutions, like checking if your cable is damaged, cleaning the ports, etc. However, I assume the issue is caused by the Pie update itself, so general solutions probably won’t do anything. </p>
<p> As this is a software bug, you have limited troubleshooting options. However, Google acknowledged this issue, so the solution should be on the way. Knowing this, there are just two things you can do. And these are updating your phone and trying a different charger (I explained below why this doesn’t fall into the ‘common solutions’ category). </p>
<p> Update your phone </p>
<p> As I said above, the charging issue is caused by a bug inside Android Pie’s code. So, the only thing left for you to do is to check for updates on a regular basis. </p>
<p> Google resolved this problem on Pixel devices way back in 2018. And if your device hasn’t received the update yet, it most definitely will soon. Once you update your phone to the latest Pie version, the charging problem should be resolved. At least that’s what Google support claims. </p>
<p> Try a different charger </p>
<p> It’s also known that Android Pie has a problem with PD chargers. For some software-related reason, you can’t use the full potential of a PD charger on a phone running Android Pie. </p>
<p> So, until Google releases an adequate update, stick to the original charger that came with your device. Sure, that still means you should frequently check for updates because the PD charging problem will also be addressed in some future patch. </p>
<p> I know I didn’t tell you much, and that your options are limited. But that’s all we know about the charging problem in Android 9 Pie so far. Of course, if you’re not sure if the charging problem is caused by the upgrade, you can always try these common solutions I mentioned above. </p>
<p> If you know more about this problem, or maybe have a ‘real’ solution, please let us know in the comments below. Any help will be appreciated. </p>

<p> There is one and only 1 way to charge the phone like this. Put it on charger, do a force reboot, and when u see a “no command” robot hold power and tap volume up. Then select reboot to bootloader. It charges like that </p>

<p> How to enable the Picture-in-Picture mode on Android 10 </p>
<p> Picture-in-Picture is a multitasking feature on Android. It allows you to keep a video window open and playing while using another app. Although I personally find it annoying sometimes, (especially when listening to music on YouTube, when the video stays on the screen instead of minimizing), I’m sure many users find it to be quite convenient. </p>
<p> That’s why I’m going to say a few words about this feature here, so you can get the most out of it. </p>
<p> How to enable Picture-in-Picture on Android 10 </p>
<p> The Picture-in-Picture feature should be enabled by default on your Android device (the only requirement is that you’re running at least Android 8 Oreo, which I assume you do). However, you can still go to settings and make sure it’s enabled for each individual app that supports it. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Apps & notifications > Special app access > Picture-in-picture. </p>
<p> From the list of apps that support Picture-in-picture, find and tap the app you want to allow to use this feature. </p>
<p> Toggle the Allow picture-in-picture option on. </p>
<p> There you go, now every time you minimize a select app while playing video, it will pop up on the screen. </p>
<p> The exception to this is YouTube. As you probably know, the free version of this service doesn’t allow you to play videos in the background. So, if you want to use the Picture-in-Picture mode with the YouTube app, you’ll have to subscribe to YouTube Premium. </p>
<p> Picture-in-Picture doesn’t work on Android 10 </p>
<p> Enabling and using Picture-in-Picture is pretty straightforward, and there isn’t much more we can say about it. But what if this feature doesn’t work? Here are a few possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Check the app compatibility </p>
<p> Even though Picture-in-Picture has come a long way since it was first introduced in Android 8 Oreo, there are still some apps that don’t support it. You can easily check if an app supports this mode by going to Settings (as explained above). If the app isn’t on the list, it doesn’t support Picture-in-Picture. </p>
<p> However, this shouldn’t be the case for the most common apps for playing video content, like YouTube Premium, Netflix, Chrome, etc. If, for example, YouTube Premium doesn’t enter the PiP mode when minimized, you’ll probably have to adjust some in-app settings. </p>
<p> Check in-app settings </p>
<p> Some apps have dedicated settings for PiP on Android. So, if PiP is disabled in-app, it won’t work, even if you allowed it in the phone’s settings. </p>
<p> YouTube Premium is a great example of this. If the PiP mode doesn’t work, you’ll have to go to Settings > General, and enable Picture-in-picture. The same can be applied to other apps. Since there’s no way for me to know which exact app are you having problems with, I can only advise you to dive into that app’s settings, and look for the option to enable picture-in-picture. </p>
<p> That’s about it. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions regarding using Picture-in-Picture on Android 10, feel free to let us know in the comments below. </p>

<p> Thanks for info. I did as you guided above. However, despite I hit ‘Yes’ for VLC player, PIP mode is forced to stop the app. </p>
<p> Also, why was PIP mode of Android default video player removed? </p>

<p> Fix: Pictures don’t appear in messages on iMessage </p>
<p> Even though there’s a large variety of instant messengers available, people are still holding on to old values that the text messages and multimedia messages provide. iMessage is one of the most used and best-designed apps out there, and it’s not strange that people are satisfied with it. </p>
<p> However, some users reported a distinctive issue with the in-message pictures can’t be seen or won’t load properly. For that purpose, we prepared a list of possible solutions that should help you resolve this problem. If you have trouble seeing the images in your text messages, make sure to check the list below. </p>
<p> Check the connection </p>
<p> Even though the text messages can be sent in all manners, for MMS messages you’ll need a proper connection in order to receive or send the multimedia files. Additionally, it’s important that both the sender and recipient have a stable connection, so make sure that the one you’re texting is also on the grid. </p>
<p> Moreover, you can restart your device as the first precautionary step and switch to a more stable Wi-Fi network rather than using the mobile data. </p>
<p> Make sure that the MMS is enabled </p>
<p> Secondly, to send and receive multimedia messages you’ll need to enable them first. If this feature isn’t enabled, you won’t see pictures, even though the sender is certain that they’re delivered. So, in order to do so, follow the instructions: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Messages. </p>
<p> Navigate to MMS Messaging and make sure that it’s enabled. </p>
<p> If not, enable it and check your Messages to look for changes. </p>
<p> If you’re still unable to see the images that are clearly sent to you, move on to the next steps. </p>
<p> Sign out/in with your AppleID </p>
<p> Some users reported that they were able to resolve the problem with pictures by re-signing with the AppleID. Namely, some kind of bug prevented them from seeing the images, and it was gone when they sign out and back in. If you’re not sure how to do that, follow the instructions below. </p>
<p> Tap and hold for a second AppleID. </p>
<p> This will restore backed up settings and messages and clear the possibly corrupted data. </p>
<p> This step should resolve your issues. But, if you still have the hard times with the pictures, check the final step on the list. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings </p>
<p> It’s not unusual for your network configuration to take a wrong turn and cause the issues with different connection-related features. The same goes for the Multimedia Messages that are dependent on the connection. Luckily, you can reset your network settings to defaults and check for changes. The one drawback is the fact that you’ll need to setup and customize all of the connections again, including Bluetooth, mobile data, and VPN. </p>
<p> This is how to reset your Network settings to their default values: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open General. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> Enter password when prompted and tap Reset to confirm. </p>
<p> After that, you’ll at least be sure that you’re in the clear. The problem is most certainly on the other end, so make sure to tell that to the one that messages you. </p>
<p> That should do it. In case you have any questions or suggestions, don’t hesitate to post them in the comments section below. </p>
<p> 5 COMMENTS </p>
<p> I’m on 12.4.5 and having a problem seeing iMessage photos that I have previously been able to see. Now it just shows me a file folder. If I click on it, it shows me the file name “IMG.0087.JPG” in “Images”. Clicking on it does nothing. I know the photo is stored somewhere because once in a great while I do see the photo in Images, but then it disappears again. </p>

<p> Fix: Play Store stuck at Download pending </p>
<p> With a simple online inquiry, we can see that the Google Play Store has a variety of isolated issues, some coming with a bit confusing codes. One common Play Store error is the Download pending error, where the downloading/updating gets stuck for some users. </p>
<p> Continue reading to find out how to solve this problem without the hassle below. </p>
<p> How do I fix pending downloads on Google Play? </p>
<p> This problem is seemingly quite common and, along with some recent reports, it goes a couple of years back. There are a couple of reasons why the Play Store keeps saying Download pending when updating or downloading apps. Piled up cache or connectivity issues are the most usual. </p>
<p> If you are stuck with this issue, make sure to check the steps we provided for you. You should be able to get things moving fast after following our instructions. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check the network and use Mobile Data </p>
<p> Firstly, we recommend inspecting connection, disabling VPN or Proxy and, alternatively, trying to switch to Mobile Data and download or update apps that way. Play Store will keep apps in a queue if the connection fails and proceed to download the next time it connects. </p>
<p> If you can connect to Wi-Fi and use other connection-dependant apps, but the problem persists, continue to the next step. On the other hand, if you can’t connect, try these steps to fix connection issues on Android: </p>
<p> Disable and re-enable Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Disable VPN or Proxy. </p>
<p> Restart your device and router/modem. </p>
<p> Enable Airplane mode and disable it after a minute or so. </p>
<p> Reset the Network settings. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear Cache and Data from Google Play Store and Downloads </p>
<p> Moving on, we suggest clearing cache and data from the Google Play Store and the Downloads app. This is probably the most commonly suggested solution, although users are not happy about clearing data every time in order to fix this error. </p>
<p> However, we are looking at a confirmed solution, so make sure to give it a try. Follow these instructions in order to clear the Cache and Data from Google Play Store and Downloads: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps and then Apps Manager or Manage apps. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and ensure that System apps are shown as well. </p>
<p> Now, locate Download Manager or just Downloads. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Uninstall Play Store updates </p>
<p> If the previous step isn’t solving the problem for you, make sure to uninstall all updates from Play Store. That way, the associated services will reset and, once the Google Play Store gets updated again, you shouldn’t have Download pending issues anymore. </p>
<p> Here’s how to uninstall Play Store updates on Android: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > App Manager or Manage Apps > Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall updates and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Connect to a network and install updates again. </p>
<p> Look for improvements when downloading or updating apps. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Wipe cache partition data </p>
<p> If the app itself isn’t the problem, chances are that we are looking at a system-wide issue. The first thing to do when system issues occur is to wipe cache partition data from the Recovery mode. This won’t delete your data, just remove all system cache, temporary files, and logs. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to wipe cache partition data and resolve the Download pending error on Play Store: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reset your device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps helped you and the issue with updating/downloading apps persist, we can only suggest resetting your device to factory settings. It’s important to back up your data (photos and other multimedia files) because this procedure will wipe out the internal storage. </p>
<p> If you are uncertain how to reset your device, follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. We thank you for reading and sincerely hope that these steps helped you address the Download pending issue on Play Store. Also, if you have anything to add or take, we encourage you to post it in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/pocophone-f1-issues" parent_folder="web1" id="file17841886" filename="pocophone-f1-issues">
<p> Pocophone F1 common issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> The global market is full of great but pricey devices. And not everyone can afford a device with the premium specs for 1000 or so bucks. That’s why the Pocophone F1 came as a surprise. A handset with the flagship CPU and all-around great specs for $300? Well, thanks to Xiaomi, this is a real thing. The Pocophone F1 packs a strong punch for a mid-range device. </p>
<p> But, after the initial well-deserved hype, some issues came to light. The most prominent ones concern the display, but there are more things which deserve a mention. That’s why we prepared a list of all common issues users reported. Will try and give you solutions for these issues, also. In addition, we’ll try to add additional issues or solutions as soon as they pop-up. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching it, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1: Multitouch issue </p>
<p> This is the first major problem users have run into. The Pocophone F1, like any other modern handset, supports a 10-fingers multitouch. However, it seems that’s not the case in practice. Users especially experienced the problem during gaming, in PUBG and similar games. Either the display touch panel was able to read only a single touch or there was a ghost touch. The latter means that display reactions come with a latency. </p>
<p> Also, the precision of the touch has shown rather lackluster results until today. These are serious problems, but there seems to be a software solution. Follow these steps to try and address the multitouch error on the Pocophone F1: </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Remove the tempered glass. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Additional settings > Button and gesture shortcuts and disable the Screenshot gesture. </p>
<p> Run the device in a safe mode. </p>
<p> Update the device. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 2: Screen bleeding issue </p>
<p> In comparison to multitouch issues, this is, sadly, a hardware problem. Namely, some users’ reports state that there’s a case of the LCD screen bleeding. The bottom part of the display panel illuminates and it seems that it’s badly placed. </p>
<p> Since this is a hardware issue on the isolated device, we strongly suggest asking for the replacement or a refund. A repair is also an option, but we advise against it. Just ask for a replacement. </p>
<p> 3: Bad brightness display sensor </p>
<p> Bad adaptive sensor readings are hardly a novelty for Xiaomi. The Adaptive brightness is a universal feature which automatically sets the brightness based upon the ambient light. As some users stated, this feature is rather erratic on the Poco F1, as the sensor frequently misses the optimal brightness levels. And the brightness either gets too low or too high, respectively. </p>
<p> Now, this can be resolved by some software patches. But, for the time being, until it’s sorted out, we suggest disabling the Automatic brightness and tweaking the display brightness by hand. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Display. </p>
<p> Disable Ambient display. </p>
<p> In addition, you can use a third-party app as the main regulator of the ambient brightness sensor. </p>
<p> 4: No battery percentage indicator/status bar notifications </p>
<p> This is not a problem per se. This is, sadly, an overlooked option due to a notch status optimization. Users are neither able to see the notification icons in the status bar nor the battery percentage. Until they swipe down the Control center. This is frequently mentioned on various forums, but we suggest sharing your concerns on the official forum, here. </p>
<p> That way the developers will be able to tweak this and make changes before the next system update comes out. </p>
<p> 5: Battery drainage </p>
<p> The Poco F1 comes with a 4000 mAh battery which provides a rather good SoT (Screen-On-Time). However, some users are suspicious about the idle drainage overnight. Namely, some of them lost up to 20% of the battery overnight. While the phone was completely idle. </p>
<p> To make a better in-depth checkup with an advanced tool which requires flashed ROM. In order to avoid all that fuzz, we’ll hit you up with some general troubleshooting steps. Make sure to try them out and the battery life should get back to normal. Here are the steps: </p>
<p> Open Developer options and disable Mobile Data always on. </p>
<p> Prevent some secondary apps from working in the background. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi overnight. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6: Lags </p>
<p> It’s unexpected for a device with a Snapdragon 845 to have any visible lags, but that’s where the software comes into play. The reported problems include keyboard delay and lag, and not-so-fluid behavior when scrolling through the app drawer or recent apps. </p>
<p> These can be assigned to the multitouch problem as well, but we still suggest some software-related troubleshooting steps. Just in case. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Clear cache from the app which freezes the most. </p>
<p> Disable apps from working in the background. Greenify should serve the purpose. </p>
<p> Update your device for a possible update fix. </p>
<p> Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 7: Camera issue </p>
<p> There’s a good reason why a lot of knowledgeable users try to port the Google Cam on lots of Xiaomi devices. The hardware isn’t bad for the price tag, but the software optimization often lacks some depth. For example, the photos a rear camera makes are too warm in comparison to some other similar models. Also, the portrait mode isn’t exactly good. Luckily, the developer promised fixes in the upcoming updates. </p>
<p> Besides that, some users reported crashes and blue dots in the camera interface. This isn’t something serious and can be dealt with the following steps: </p>
<p> Boot into Safe mode and test the camera. </p>
<p> Clear Camera app’s data. </p>
<p> Update the device. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 8: Microphone issue </p>
<p> Good microphone performance is of the utmost importance. Most of the users are satisfied with the mic sound input the Poco F1 makes. However, some of them had various problems with sound distortion while talking on the phone. </p>
<p> Here’s how to address some of the microphone issues on Poco F1: </p>
<p> Make sure there’s no any debris filling in the mic compartment. </p>
<p> Enable Microphone permission for all associated apps. </p>
<p> Reset Apps preferences. </p>
<p> Use a third-party app to configure the microphone. </p>
<p> 9: Distorted audio </p>
<p> In comparison to some other entries on this list, this is quite a prominent problem. Lots of sound issues appeared while gaming and on the 3.5-inch headphones, but even the built-in speakers are either too low on volume or too loud. In addition, there’s a metallic, muffled and distorted sound output bothering some users. </p>
<p> These are already being worked on by the developers, as we find out on the official support forum. However, until the finite resolution comes, you can try some of these steps to resolve sound issues in Pocophone F1: </p>
<p> Disable absolute volume in Developer options. Open System settings > About phone and tap 7 times on the Build number to unlock Developer options. Once you can access them, toggle “Disable Absolute volume” on. </p>
<p> If the sound issues emerge in video streaming apps (e.g. YouTube), reset the app to factory settings and try again. </p>
<p> Use a medical alcohol and cloth to clear the mic and speaker. After that, you can use a compressed air to remove all debris. </p>
<p> Boot your device in a Safe mode and test the speaker both with media files and in calls. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> 10: Fingerprint scanner and face unlock issues </p>
<p> With Pocophone F1, Xiaomi went a step further in the biometric security measures with the implementation of IR scanning for a more advanced Face unlock. In addition, there’s also a good old fingerprint reader, which is, just like all other Xiaomi handsets, quite fast. But, users have had some issues with one or another, as the setup and usage are not as seamless as advertised. </p>
<p> Of course, these are isolated cases, but we still advise contacting the support. But, before that, give a try to these workarounds before sending your device for a replacement: </p>
<p> Re-configure the fingerprint and set a new Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Try booting into Safe mode and, if the fingerprint and IR scanner perform better, uninstall all recently installed apps. </p>
<p> Remove the tempered glass or cases which may cover the fingerprint scanner. </p>
<p> Clean the fingerprint sensor from a debris and greasy dirt with a wet cloth. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory values. In most occasions, we suggest restoring your device from a backup afterward. In this case, we suggest starting clean. </p>
<p> 11: Android Auto won’t work </p>
<p> Android Auto is an important piece of the Android ecosystem and an irreplaceable feature for lots of users who value Android features on their car’s board computer. Especially Maps, Waze, calls, and multimedia playback. However, it seems that some users weren’t able to connect and configure Android Auto when pairing the car system and the Pocophone F1. </p>
<p> This can be a dealbreaker for so many users which chose the Pocophone F1 as their daily driver. Nonetheless, until the official patch addresses this, you can try these steps and, hopefully, make it work: </p>
<p> Reinstall the Android Auto app on the Pocaphone F1. </p>
<p> Allow all permissions to Android Auto. </p>
<p> Allow USB debugging in the Developer options. </p>
<p> 12: The phone won’t update </p>
<p> Finally, we have mentioned a system update as a viable solution for many aches the Pocaphone F1 has. However, it’s hard to resolve software issues if you’re unable to download updates in the first place. </p>
<p> There are a dozen reports about update errors. Some say that they have available updates while others haven’t got a single update notification. Either way, here are some steps you can try out to get the latest update for the Poco F1: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> Open Developer Options and disable Auto-update and check for updates manually. </p>
<p> Reset the Pocophone F1 to factory settings. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. In case you have any problems we forgot about, suggestions, or alternative solutions make sure to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: Poor call sound quality on iPhone 7 </p>
<p> Smartphones are taking over. Statistically, the most used multimedia devices in upcoming years are going to be the handheld ones. Browsing on the go, social media and fast-paced, online communications are main traits that modern user needs. However, what happened with its main use? With good old standard calls? </p>
<p> For example, you can do more stuff with your iPhone 7 than with desktop computer but the in-call sound is distorted. Especially while using standard calls. </p>
<p> The hefty number of iPhone 7 users reported a problem concerning the in-call disturbance. </p>
<p> Today we prepared for you some optimal solutions for distorting and hollow sound, and/or bad microphone performance while making a call. </p>
<p> How to improve bad call sound quality on iPhone 7 </p>
<p> One small disclaimer before we start. If your iPhone 7 or 7+ variation are having the hardware issue, this steps may help. However, our advice is to contact your Apple Support. </p>
<p> Disable Noise cancellation on iPhone 7 </p>
<p> Noise cancellation is a built-in option that helps you by reducing ambient noise while speaking on the phone. Good intention but some of the users found it unsatisfying. To disable it, follow the instructions: </p>
<p> Tap Settings </p>
<p> Select General </p>
<p> Choose Accessibility </p>
<p> At the bottom, you will find Phone Noise Cancellation </p>
<p> Turn it OFF </p>
<p> Select Data Only in Mobile Data Options </p>
<p> There may be a problem concerning your Mobile Data. Maybe your VoLTE ( Voice over LTE) is the one that makes calls distorted, so try disabling it. To that follow this path: </p>
<p> Select Mobile Data </p>
<p> Choose Mobile Data Options </p>
<p> Tap Enable LTE </p>
<p> Try using the phone without the case </p>
<p> There are some reports that your case can be the issue while speaking on the phone. Because it covers rear microphone, sometimes may cause the distortion. </p>
<p> Remove your case and check your in-call performance without it. </p>
<p> Turn Off the Bluetooth </p>
<p> Interference may also occur because of your headset and phone speaker. To be sure that is not the case, disable Bluetooth: </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Select Bluetooth </p>
<p> Turn Bluetooth OFF. </p>
<p> Try restarting the phone </p>
<p> If the problem is somehow connected to the software, the reset may be of help. To reset your iPhone 7, do the following: </p>
<p> Press and hold Wake and Volume Down buttons </p>
<p> Wait until the Apple logo appears. </p>
<p> Try updating to the latest version of iOS </p>
<p> Keeping your phone updated is a good way to overcame slight software issues, probably even the sound ones. To update your system, follow these instructions. </p>
<p> Make sure your iPhone 7 is connected to a Wi-Fi and charging. </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Choose General </p>
<p> Select Software Update </p>
<p> Tap Download & Install </p>
<p> These were our tips to a possible solution to your annoying problem. We hope it will help you to perform better in-call performance. If you are still heaving trouble concerning iPhone 7, please be free to share it with us in the comment section. Or reach us out on Twitter </p>

<p> Believe it or not. My husband bought an iPhone 7 plus two months ago it was a disaster as every one said they can’t understand because the sound is hollow and distorted. He went back to the dealer and got it exchanged but for his bad luck the second was the same. Yesterday he went back to get the third one and it was the worst. I could barely understand him when he called me from work. He is so disappointed and upset. Every single phone should be tested for defects before releasing such garbage into the market. </p>

<p> I am having the same problem with my iPhone 7. With the Lifeproof case on it (which I bought because I am around water a lot), people say I sound muffled. I have to consciously speak at a much lower volume, so that to people on my end of the conversation get to experience me yelling into my phone. I have finally taken the case off. Apparently the problem is that the iPhone 7 has only 2 or 3 microphones and something like the Android, which doesn’t have this problem, has 7 microphones. My fiancee has a Lifeproof case on… Read more » </p>

<p> I second that the phone cases might have been the issue that affects the call quality. It happened to be my experience that every time I was on the call, the other end would tell me that they couldn’t hear me, or my sound was muffed, while I could hear them just fine. I have been using wallet cases for over a year…and ever since I remove my phone from the case, everyone, I repeat, EVERYONE, on the phone told me they could hear me very clearly. My wallet case only slightly covers half of the two microphones my iPhone… Read more » </p>

<p> I’m on my 2nd replacement – so 3rd iPhone 7 in 6 months & every one of them has terrible sound issues. Callers constantly say my voice breaks up, or is garbled, or muffled, or like I’m talking through water. This is my business phone and I deal with a lot of clients so it is a real issue and no one seems to have an answer. Apple has to be aware of the problem but doesn’t seem to have a fix. Very frustrating. </p>

<p> If I purchase a 1000$ Smart phone I expect that it is in perfect working condition.The apple developers had time enough to test the device before release.The best way to loose costumers. </p>

<p> How to prevent your Android from eating mobile data </p>
<p> Wireless is a go-to connection for all of the mobile devices, but the concept of on-the -go mobile connectivity can be completed solely with the mobile data. At any point, you can run mobile data connection and browse the internet or update your social networks. </p>
<p> Of course, if you have a limited data package, careless use can lead to all kinds of trouble. Don’t be surprised if your month pricing exceeds all expectations. Even though most of the update-related processes are disabled on mobile data by default, it seems that occasionally Android has a way to consume your cellular data. To make matters even worse, data-consuming processes may work in the background, so you won’t even be aware before it’s too late. </p>
<p> So if you notice any unreasonable data consumption, we advise you to follow these tips. We gathered essential features you should check out in order to fix this issue. </p>
<p> Play Store </p>
<p> First things first. Google Play Store‘s apps update is probably the most dangerous feature when it comes to data consumption. As we already stated, default settings should use only Wi-Fi connection with updates. However, for no apparent reason, your apps may update over mobile data. Because of that, we advise you to check out these settings by following these steps: </p>
<p> Open Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Auto-update apps </p>
<p> Select to Auto-update apps over Wi-Fi only. </p>
<p> With that, you’ll disable possible Auto-updates via mobile data and protect your data package from overconsuming. </p>
<p> Backup & Sync </p>
<p> Another feature that is widely used and can deplete your data is the backup. Sometimes it’s hard to determine exact app that is using your mobile data for backup. You may be using 3rd-party Cloud storage apps, native Google Drive Photo or specific apps that are presented with certain OEMs like Samsung Cloud. </p>
<p> We advise you to check them out and make sure they are backing up your data only via Wi-Fi connection. The supreme leader of mobile data monsters is Samsung Cloud, known for ridiculous mobile data consuming. If you’re packing a Samsung handset, you can disable it this way: </p>
<p> Tap Samsung Cloud. </p>
<p> Choose More. </p>
<p> Open Network Settings. </p>
<p> This goes for Samsung models but, in case you are having similar cloud apps on your phone, make sure you check their monthly data consumption. That way you’ll eventually find the culprit for data loss. </p>
<p> Tethering </p>
<p> Another feature that may deplete your mobile data is mobile tethering. Tethering is, as you are probably familiar with, the feature that lets you share your phone mobile data with other devices via Wi-Fi. It can be a quite useful feature, but it’s not advised to use it with the limited data package. </p>
<p> Most Android devices have native Tethering app but occasionally you’ll be using 3rd-party solutions. It’s quite important to disable it after every use. For example, if the tethering connection with PC is not set as metered connection, your PC may perform updates. Since we are talking about large updates with enormous files, your mobile data may evaporate incredibly fast. </p>
<p> Apps </p>
<p> Apps are the elementary part of every smartphone. But besides their indispensable role in the Android OS, they can make your life hell in no time. There are too many apps that are available for download but not all of them are exactly safe to use. And that goes for their background mobile data consumption, as well. </p>
<p> So, when using connection-related apps, like instant messengers, social network apps or video streaming apps, be sure to check for data anomalies. Namely, if you notice even slightest anomalies with your cellular data consumption, make sure to uninstall those apps and try alternative ones. </p>
<p> You can check apps data usage this way: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Wireless & Networks. </p>
<p> Select Data usage. </p>
<p> Monitoring is of utmost importance for discovering the problematic app. </p>
<p> Additional Steps </p>
<p> There are additional steps you can perform to resolve issues with data usage. </p>
<p> Use Airplane mode to prevent all connections. This is, obviously, a temporary solution. </p>
<p> Limit your Data Usage. Navigate to Settings >Wireless & Networks > Data Usage. Toggle Set Mobile Data Limit and choose the limitation value. </p>
<p> Reset phone Network Settings. </p>
<p> Restore phone factory settings. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. Even though we covered most of the universal guilty parties, some of the users mentioned specific carrier or device issues. In case you’ve checked everything and the data leak is still present, we advise you to contact your carrier or device distributor. </p>
<p> In case you have any questions or alternative solutions, please share them with us and other readers. </p>

<p> Hi Grace. If you’re talking about Google Drive, you’ve probably exceeded the 15GB limit of the free storage. You need to pay for additional space, and Google probably asks if you want to upgrade. </p>

<p> How to check RAM usage in Android Oreo </p>
<p> If you’re an avid Android user and you never had the urge to check what’s eating RAM on your device, well, you’re a rarity and we salute you. For some of us, checking on background-working, RAM-hoggin apps is a must. But, once Oreo hit the deck, it’s rather hard to do it on stock Android devices. </p>
<p> Don’t worry, RAM usage readings aren’t completely out of the picture. They are well-hidden and today we’ll show you how to access them without trouble. </p>
<p> Besides the processing power, RAM was always the issue back in the days. The lack of the optimization caused the outbursts of RAM-hogging applications. But those days are in the past. Modern smartphones have a lot of RAM. Mid-budget phones with as much as 4 gigs of RAM are rather common. It’s really, like really hard to deplete the memory. And it’s a part of the muscle memory to check and clear, nonetheless. </p>
<p> On that note, a lot of Nougat users run various third-party applications (provided by the individual OEMs most of the time) to control the background activity and reduce the redundant RAM usage. Google is kind of going in the other, purist direction. With Oreo, they prefer the system making these changes on its own. No simple manual access, no simple prevention of the RAM-hungry background apps. And that system role seems to work just fine. Except when it doesn’t. </p>
<p> Even though the user’s interference is rather limiting on Android Oreo, there are still ways to check, track, or clear RAM memory. The first one concerns hidden Developer Options. The second requires a few tweaks with the built-in widget. </p>
<p> Check memory within the Developer Options </p>
<p> Developers Options are there from the start. They’re, for some reason, hidden and require a gimmicky sequence to access them. However, once you’re there, you can check and track the RAM usage, starting from the system and reaching to individual apps. </p>
<p> This aforementioned sequence mostly requires accessing the System settings > About phone on your device and tapping the Build number 7 times. We said ‘mostly’ because there are some OEMs which require different input in order to access the Developer Options. You might want to look up your device online if the conventional way won’t work. </p>
<p> Here’s how to check the RAM usage on Oreo with Developer Options: </p>
<p> Tap Settings </p>
<p> Open System settings. </p>
<p> Tap About phone. </p>
<p> Tap 7 times continuously on the Build number to enable the Developer Options. </p>
<p> Open Developer Options and look for Memory or Running processes. </p>
<p> Tap this option and you should see the RAM usage with real-time readings. </p>
<p> In addition, you can choose to track RAM usage at different intervals, starting with the hourly check. </p>
<p> Use a widget to monitor RAM usage </p>
<p> There are hundreds and hundreds of different apps which comply with this simple need. However, we won’t recommend using those bloated all-in-one maintenance tools as a rule. Don’t get us wrong, they can be rather helpful for various reasons. But, if you reach deep into the core of the Android as an OS, you’ll find that manually terminating and restarting certain app takes more RAM memory than to let the OS itself optimize it. </p>
<p> With that said, we’ll focus only on the system provided tools. In the end – that’s the main idea behind this article. What you’ll need to do in this scenario is to create a Settings widget and choose Memory from the list. After that, you’ll have the complete insight in largest RAM consumers. </p>
<p> Here’s how to do it in a few simple steps: </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Home screen empty space until the Customization menu pops up. </p>
<p> Choose Widgets. </p>
<p> Find Settings and drag Settings icon to empty Home screen space. </p>
<p> From there, select Memory from the list of various shortcuts. </p>
<p> That’s it. Now you can check RAM whenever you want. </p>
<p> This should give you enough insight on RAM-hogging apps so you can disable them timely. Have in mind that some system apps can’t be disabled or if they can, it won’t perform as usual. Concerning the third-party apps, if they make your RAM usage hit the ceiling, navigate to Settings > Apps and eliminate them. </p>
<p> On that note, we can wrap it up. In case you have some questions or points to make concerning the RAM usage on Oreo, speak your mind. The comments section is just below. </p>

<p> why can’t we have a mobile data switch in the notifications drop dow like it used to be on earlier versions of Android? I have a very limited data plan, but a lot of wifi. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/ransomware-mobile-phones" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844571" filename="ransomware-mobile-phones">
<p> Can Ransomware affect phones too? </p>
<p> Yes, it can. Everything can be affected. If there’s an OS, they’ll find a way to take an advantage of it. Including ransomware, banking malware or adware. And ransomware is probably the worst of them all. If you’re not sure which device is prone to malware attacks, just check if it has ‘smart’ in its name. If that’s the case, well, you better take a look at what we got to say and learn how to protect from this emerging threat that’s ever-growing phenomena. </p>
<p> Ransomware on smartphones: neo-crime we need to protect ourselves from </p>
<p> Ransomware essentials </p>
<p> First, let us explain what’s ransomware and how it can hurt you. Ransomware is, in some manner, a modern successor to hijacking. Hackers gain access to your sensitive data and encrypt it or take a complete control of your device. In order to get your data/device back, you need to pay a certain amount of money. Most of the time they demand payments in bitcoins which are harder to track and easier to collect. After you pay, they provide you with the decryption key or password and the exchange ends there. Or does it? You can never be sure. Moreover, if your stolen data is secretive or intimate, they can leak it, which is, for all intents and purposes, horrendous. </p>
<p> This kind of cyber crime is already established as a constant threat in the PC world. You’ve probably have heard about the WannaCry crisis that emerged a few months ago and it struck down a few massive organizations and individuals in more than 150 states. More than 300,000 computers were affected. Including the Healthcare Service in England and telecom giant in Spain. </p>
<p> You can assume on your own what kind of personal patients data can store a Healthcare Service and conclude on your own what are the risks caused by the lack of proper security measures. Microsoft managed to stop it with a timely update, but there’s also a Petya ransomware which is much harder to address due to a better organization. And much more of those might emerge in the incoming months and years, with better organized and conducted cyber attacks. </p>
<p> What about smartphones? </p>
<p> But, we digress, let us get back to smartphones. Can Petya or WannaCry affect phones? It’s hard to say but chances are rather small. Of course, if you keep your hands of suspicious third-party non-trusted apps and update your device on time. However, it seems cyber-criminals are always one step ahead. Advancing and innovating the ways to take an advantage of security loopholes and naive or careless users. </p>
<p> Albeit, as the time pass, we can expect the rise of smartphone ransomware. Firstly, many users sync all devices and, if you want to choose the entry point, the smartphone is an obvious choice. Smartphones are taking over in many regards, and with the NFC payment technology not being a novelty anymore, your goods are endangered, too. All kind’s of credentials, photos, videos, even messages – everything is up for a grab and, for some random hacker, it translates into one word: monetization. </p>
<p> As one would suspect, Android is much more prone to cyber attacks than iOS. These are the main reasons why the Android suffers in this regard: </p>
<p> Outdated OS. Over 33% of Android users are still using Android Lollipop and around 31% is stuck with Marshmallow. These users are still getting security updates but they won’t get upgrades to Android O 8.0, which is, allegedly, going to be a much better-protected OS and will resolve some of the security loopholes that are present even on Nougat. </p>
<p> Unaddressed permission. This is kind of continuation of present point. One permission that enables hackers to utilize apps for ransomware and other cyber attacks is still not addressed. And it will be on Android O as promised by Google. This is a notorious ”System Alert Window” permission that enables a certain app to display its content over other apps. Don’t install those apps, except if you’re sure they can be trusted. Like Facebook Messenger, for example, which is horrific performance-wise but it’s indeed a trustworthy app. </p>
<p> Lack of security updates. When compared to iOS, Android is a synonym for diversity. It covers dozens of manufacturers and, except for their own models (including Pixel and cooperation handset Nexus series), they’re not really responsible for the security updates management. That’s the responsibility of OEM or carrier. And more times than not, users need to wait for some time to take a hold of those. And once a major update comes, it’s frequently more of a problem than a solution. </p>
<p> Open-source nature of Android. Custom ROM, like Lineage, is great for so many reasons. Especially for more advanced users that know they way around the Android platform. However, they are slightly more prone to security loopholes. On the other hand, due to open-source nature of the system, it’s easier for hackers to create and push malware in the form of non-store apps. </p>
<p> How to protect </p>
<p> That doesn’t mean iOS can’t suffer from cyber attacks. It can. But due to the exclusivity of iOS, it’s harder to create and push malware. Especially trough Apple Store. Now, once we identified the threat, we can provide you with ways to protect your phone from this uprising menace. </p>
<p> Install OS updates whenever prompted. </p>
<p> Even though the hackers are seemingly always one step ahead, that doesn’t mean you should give up on updates. They save your skin more times than not. It’s highly advised to always have the latest available OS version installed and that’s, among the other things, the essential way to protect yourself from ransomware. </p>
<p> Don’t install apps from unofficial third-party sites. </p>
<p> At least, if you can’t be 100% sure that’s the safe app to use. Of course, you can make an exception, especially if the developer offers an open code and it’s appropriately checked by multiple users. For example, XDA is a third-party site you have no reason to doubt. But, always keep the eyes open. Better safe than sorry. </p>
<p> Antivirus won’t help you. It’s a well-marketed lie. </p>
<p> Antivirus for a smartphone can be useful, don’t get us wrong. But its role lies more in secondary tools than in a protection itself. If you ask us, you can get any third-party antivirus. But don’t rely on it to protect you and then drop your guard. In other terms, most of the devices offer built-in tools for protection and advanced control, so we question a need to obtain the paid tool. </p>
<p> Don’t open suspicious links. </p>
<p> Starting from in-app ads that pop up all the time, and leading to email and website links: don’t click everything. Or rather, install the ad blocking extension of some kind. Developers of freeware software earn their money with ads, but no one can guarantee what are those and what’s behind them. </p>
<p> Restrict permissions. </p>
<p> Yes, you can manually disable every permission you initially enabled. However, how many of you read the permission prompt before the app is installed? We can surely say – not many. For that purpose, it highly advised to navigate to Apps (especially on Android) and disable permissions that might seem unreasonable for certain app. You can easily enable them again in-app when it’s needed. </p>
<p> Backup your data timely. </p>
<p> Data backup is another essential procedure that should be a routine. And for so many reasons. You can destroy your phone, lose it, get it stolen, or infected by malware. And your data will be always reachable. If you backup everything, you can, later on, restore your phone to old settings. Not to mention the unique memorabilia, like photos or videos. Backup frequently! In addition, watch the content you’re storing on your phone. If something is intimate, transfer it to PC and encrypt it. </p>
<p> In case you’re already trapped, don’t pay. </p>
<p> If you follow the previous step and you get yourself under the will of cyber-criminals, they can’t do you a thing. On the other hand, even if you’re in a hopeless scenario, you can still refuse to pay. Why the hell would I do that, you might ask. Well, because no one guarantees your data won’t be used in some malicious manner. In addition, every time they get paid for their notorious work, they are motivated to continue. Act with caution and don’t negotiate with criminals. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> With that, we’re done. We hope this brought you closer the hazards behind ransomware and encouraged you to watch out your steps. Even its presence is limited in comparison to PC ransomware, smartphone ransomware is a cyber crime in its infancy. But once it grows, it can grow huge. </p>

<p> How to restore deleted photos from iCloud on iPhone </p>
<p> Accidents happen. All of us deleted or have lost some important data or, in this exact case, photos, because of wrong click or tap/software malfunction/hardware meltdown. A couple of years ago that may have been a problem, but nowadays you can backup everything. </p>
<p> And when we say ‘back up’, we don’t mean copy to PC storage or burn to a disk. Every iPhone/iPad user can backup and automatically encrypt complete data to the iCloud online storage. And today we’ll explain how to access and retrieve accidently deleted photos from iCloud. </p>
<p> How to recover deleted photos from iCloud </p>
<p> Let’s start simple. Take your time and try to remember have you had deleted photos in your Camera Roll when the recent backup was performed. If you’re positive, you can easily retrieve your photos. On the other hand, if you took photos after the latest backup, chances are, sadly, that you won’t be able to recover them. </p>
<p> Have in mind that restoring a backup from iCloud will erase all of your data, so backup your data timely to avoid additional loss. Namely, you can’t use iCloud to restore selective, individual files, but rather for restoring the whole backup. There are a few 3rd-party software solutions for accessing individual files, but we don’t advise you to use those due to security risks. So, in order to restore a backup from iCloud, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap iCloud. </p>
<p> Open Backup. </p>
<p> Tap Backup Now. </p>
<p> Once you’ve backed up your data, move on to reset and restore. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Choose Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Erase all content and settings. </p>
<p> After the procedure is finished, make sure your battery is full and that you’re connected to stable Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> From the Apps & Data screen, tap Restore from iCloud Backup and sign in to iCloud. </p>
<p> Tap Choose backup. </p>
<p> Select preferred backup. The one with the deleted photo is an obvious choice. </p>
<p> Once the device is restored, you should be able to access deleted photo. </p>
<p> Now, to reduce the risk of losing sensitive data again, you may use iTunes for the backup, as well. Having an alternative always comes handy. True, you still won’t be able to restore individual files, but, next time, you’ll spend much less time to retrieve the data. </p>
<p> If you are prompted with the security check, insert passcode. </p>
<p> Highlight your device and click Backup Now. Have in mind that you can either use encryption or not. If you decide to encrypt your files, you’ll need to create a password. Make sure you remember it (or write it down) since you won’t be able to access backup without it. </p>
<p> After the process is finished, make sure that the backup was a success in iTunes Preferences > Devices >Your device. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. We hope you’ve managed to restore your lost memorabilia. In case you have any questions or suggestions, make sure to tell us in the comments below. </p>

<p> Redmi 8A common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Xiaomi has such a variety of devices for all price segments. One of the most interesting devices on the market in the low-budget division must be Redmi 8A. Great affordable entry device for all undemanding users out there. However, as all of them, the Redmi 8A has a variety of bugs and common issues we run into on various forums. </p>
<p> We made sure to list all more prominent issues below, along with applicable solutions. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Slow and laggy performance </p>
<p> With its Snapdragon 439 chipset and up to 4 GB of RAM, the Redmi 8A is quite a regular budget device. It would be unreasonable to expect anything amazing from a device at this price point. Especially from the 2/32 GB variation. However, users reported slow performance and UI lags even with the minimum load, which shouldn’t be the case. </p>
<p> Now, we all know that Xiaomi’s MIUI (Redmi is Xiaomi’s subsidiary FYI) sometimes works flawlessly while other times, due to a lack of proper optimization, it doesn’t hold up to expected standards. </p>
<p> We have a few things you can try to improve the performance of the Redmi 8A. Try with these steps: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > My device > System and check for updates. Install an update if available. </p>
<p> Enable Developer options (Settings > My device > All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number). Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options and disable MIUI Optimization at the bottom. </p>
<p> Get back in Developer options and reduce Animation from 1 to 0.5. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings (the procedure is explained at the bottom of this article). </p>
<p> 2. Redmi 8A overheating </p>
<p> Overheating is never good. If the device is hot over prolonged periods of time, this might lead to fatal hardware damage and render it unusable. It happens rarely but it’s a possibility nonetheless. </p>
<p> Users reported that Redmi 8A is overheating, especially during charging. If that’s the case for you, consider following the steps below: </p>
<p> Remove the protective case. </p>
<p> Don’t use your device while charging. </p>
<p> Turn on Airplane mode while charging. </p>
<p> 3. Battery draining </p>
<p> Having consistent battery longevity is quite hard these days with streaming and gaming and whatnot. One of the selling points of the Redmi 8A is definitely that enormous 5000 mAh Li-Po battery. Big enough to provide users with astonishing 15+ hours of Screen-on Time. </p>
<p> However, some owners of the Redmi 8A reported battery draining fast on the stock MIUI ROM. This is especially prominent after major updates. Follow these instructions to reduce battery draining and increase the SoT on your device: </p>
<p> Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Disable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and individually disable Autostart on apps. </p>
<p> Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery. </p>
<p> 4. Screen freezing and yellow tint issues </p>
<p> Again, for this money, it would be too much to expect miracles in any area, especially the display. However, some things can’t be overlooked, as there are reports about screen misbehaving and having a prominent yellow tint. </p>
<p> It seems that the screen has a yellowish tint with the Original setting in Color Scheme options. What you can do is switch to Auto. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to switch to Auto Color Scheme and resolve issues with the yellow tint on Redmi 8A: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Display. </p>
<p> Select Color Scheme. </p>
<p> Choose Auto instead of the Original setting. </p>
<p> 5. Low speaker volume </p>
<p> Low volume has been an issue in various categories and on different Xiaomi/Redmi-made devices. It seems that’s the case here, as well. The loudspeaker is not that loud, headphone sound is, although without crackling, not as loud as some users would like to. Not to mention awful sound in the recordings with a bitrate that’s just subpar. </p>
<p> We can only hope that Redmi will address this with future patches, as there’s nothing else we can do to address it. That’s not completely true as there’s a way to tweak volume on rooted devices. That’s a risky business so we suggest avoiding it unless you are perfectly comfortable with rooting your device. </p>
<p> 6. Screen stuck on the dialer </p>
<p> Some users reported an unusual bug that renders the device unusable until it’s rebooted. Namely, it seems that the built-in Dialer app tends to crash and freeze the Redmi 8A for some. </p>
<p> This, of course, is something no one wants to see. Not even on a seldom basis. In order to address this, we suggest going for the Force stop in the Dialer app. After that, clear data and cache from the app. </p>
<p> If the issue persists, resetting your device to factory settings should help. Just don’t forget to back up your data first. </p>
<p> 7. Bad touch response </p>
<p> Ghost touch and “screen bleeding” are two things that users with IPS displays might run into. Now, it seems that there is a small screen bleeding on the top and bottom of the display. It’s barely visible, mostly with the dark wallpaper and on high brightness levels. Nothing too serious. </p>
<p> However, bad touch response is more of a problem. Some users on a dedicated forum have had a hard time with the touch screen responsiveness. There’s only so much you can do if this issue occurs and here’s what we suggest: </p>
<p> Turn the “Double tap to wake or turn off screen” off. </p>
<p> Remove the screen protector. </p>
<p> Clear the screen with a wet cloth. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 8. Poor Wi-Fi and Mobile signal strength </p>
<p> These fall in the category of most frequently reported issues on the Redmi 8A. If you were wondering if the Redmi 8A supports the 5 GHz wireless band, the answer is no. In addition, some users have a hard time with the bandwidth speed with the 2.4 GHz band as well. </p>
<p> Moreover, the network coverage is not all that great for some users. Not only that bad network coverage/signal affects voice calls and mobile data speeds, but it also, due to repetitive searching for network, depletes battery much faster than usual. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to troubleshoot connectivity issues on the Redmi 8A: </p>
<p> Reset APN settings to default values. </p>
<p> Remove your SIM card and re-insert it again. </p>
<p> Reboot your phone and router. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 9. Redmi 8A camera quality issues </p>
<p> The main camera is not all that great to start with (of course, we must consider the price point here), but it can be better. The problem, like on most Xiaomi phones, lies in the subpar image processing software. </p>
<p> You can mitigate that and make the camera better than expected with a GCAM port. Camera ports brought from Google Pixel devices have much better processing capabilities and will do the best with the hardware you have. </p>
<p> There are not many ports for this device at the moment (and it’s not all that likely there will be many of them). That doesn’t mean that there are none. </p>
<p> Here’s how to get yourself a GCAM port for the Redmi 8A: </p>
<p> In a browser on your handset, navigate to the Gcam Hub, here, and download one of the versions (one is for MIUI 11 on Android 10 and one is for Android Pie based MIUI 10/11). </p>
<p> Allow installation of apps from third-party sources when prompted. </p>
<p> Install Gcam and that’s it. You can tweak some options in Settings to your liking. Enjoy. </p>
<p> 10. Can’t set a lock screen wallpaper </p>
<p> This, so to say problem, is frequently reported for many MIUI-based devices out there. Users are just unable to change the lock screen wallpaper. And the solution is rather simple. </p>
<p> All you need to do is download the wallpaper to your local storage. Once there, navigate to Settings > Wallpaper in the main menu. Select the Local photos, choose a photo from an album and tap OK. Then just tap Apply and choose Lock Screen. As simple as that. </p>
<p> 11. Phone turns off on its own </p>
<p> This is a serious problem and, unless you’ve meddled with custom ROMs, we highly recommend to take your device for a repair or ask for a replacement. In most reported cases we are looking at a factory defect and thus there’s nothing you can do to resolve it on your own. </p>
<p> Contact your retailer or carrier and return the device for repairs or, preferably, ask for a new handset. </p>
<p> 12. IR Blaster doesn’t work </p>
<p> The Redmi 8A, like many other Xiaomi/Redmi devices, comes with a built-in IR Blaster that allows you to remotely control TVs, stereo devices, and even some appliances. This might come in handy. However, it seems that users are unable to utilize this nifty hardware feature on their devices. </p>
<p> First of all, make sure that your device is supported in the Mi Remote controller app. If it is supported, remove it and try pairing it again. Alternatively, you can reinstall the app and give pairing with Mi Remote controller another go. </p>
<p> 13. Common troubleshooting steps for Redmi 8A </p>
<p> Boot the device into Safe Mode </p>
<p> Turn the device off. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and then, once the Xiaomi logo appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down button. </p>
<p> To exit Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Reset the device to Factory Settings </p>
<p> Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> Side note: If you find MIUI too much bloated (too many unnecessary system apps), learn how to debloat it and make it both faster and cleaner while significantly improving battery life. Find our article on the subject with detailed instructions, here. </p>
<p> With that said, we can wrap up this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to add additional issues we possibly overlooked as we might be able to help you out. The comments section is below. </p>

<p> I regularly send pictures and photos using my Redmi 8A. But lately, since the BIGO LIVE App installed, I have been unable to do this, with the error message telling me it doesn’t have enough memory. When I go into my gmail account and try sending photos, I cannot attach them. Any tips, please? </p>

<p> Very bad user experience, apps suddenly gets closed, battery life goes dull after 3 days on newly use, network connectivity is like a nightmare and last but not the least it doesn’t have any fingerprint lock. A fantastic waste of time, money, and security. Anyone who want to buy this cell phone, last words for that fellow- get ready to meet a nightmare. </p>

<p> Redmi 8 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Xiaomi’s subsidiary, Redmi, introduced a lot of great budget devices in 2019. One of the best devices in their low-budget segment must be Redmi 8 (along with Redmi 8A). Now, we decided to look out for the most common Redmi 8 issues online and brought them to you in the list below. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Screen freeze </p>
<p> It would be unreasonable to expect that a device in this price segment can do miracles. The Redmi 8 is a budget device and there’s only so much processing it can do without showing signs of slowing down or freezing. With that said, your regular usage shouldn’t suffer, which seems to be the case with some users who reported screen freezing and hanging in apps. </p>
<p> Navigating through UI, browsing the internet/social media, or streaming videos on YT shouldn’t be a problem. Even on the 3GB variation of the Redmi 8. But it is for some. </p>
<p> If you are experiencing screen freezing on the Redmi 8 or having similar issues (lags and stutters in apps), make sure to try these steps: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > My device > System and check for updates. Install an update if available. </p>
<p> Enable Developer options (Settings > My device > All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number). Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options and disable MIUI Optimization at the bottom. </p>
<p> Get back in Developer options and reduce Animation from 1 to 0.5. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings (the procedure is explained at the bottom of this article). </p>
<p> 2. Video on Snapchat and Instagram not working </p>
<p> Probably the most reported problem on various forums concerning the Redmi 8. For some reason, video recording or video calling in certain 3rd-apps doesn’t work. This issue is especially prominent on Snapchat and Instagram, although there are reports about other apps as well. </p>
<p> We have a list of solutions but, unless the developer patches things indefinitely, we can’t say they’ll work for sure. Here’s what to do in order to fix video issues on Redmi 8: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps. Open Instagram or Snapchat and clear data and cache. </p>
<p> Follow the same path as above and open Permissions. Make sure to grant all permissions. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app. </p>
<p> Install an older APK version of the app. </p>
<p> 3. Slow Wi-Fi </p>
<p> Another big problem that’s bothering users is Wi-Fi speed. Many reports state that, when the Bluetooth is enabled, Wi-Fi speeds plummet. There are some root-only solutions out there, but we don’t suggest using them if you don’t know your way around modding. Also, it’s important to say that this device doesn’t work on 5GHz wireless frequency so make sure to stick to 2.4GHz. </p>
<p> The best way to tackle this problem (besides disabling Bluetooth while using Wi-Fi, which is merely a workaround) is to follow these steps: </p>
<p> Enable Airplane mode and disable it. </p>
<p> Restart your phone and router. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 4. Fast charging doesn’t work </p>
<p> Officially, the Redmi 8 supports 18 fast charging but the out-of-the-box charger is the 10W one. So, if you decide to speed up the charging process (which, truth to be told, can take a lot of time with the stock charger), you should probably get an official 18W charger. Now, some users reported that fast charging doesn’t work. </p>
<p> The first thing we must stress is the importance of the proper charger. The charger should be 9V and 2 amp for the device to utilize fast charging. Additionally, make sure to keep your Redmi 8 up to date, as updates should deal with issues. </p>
<p> 5. Missing Xiaomi apps </p>
<p> Global MIUI ROMs are no longer coming with Xiaomi Dialer, Contacts, and Messaging. They are replaced with Google’s alternatives for privacy matters. This might be an issue for some users who had their contacts, call logs and messages backed up on Mi Cloud on their previous devices. </p>
<p> Luckily, you can sideload missing Xiaomi apps with ease and use them instead of Google’s Phone and Messages. Follow these steps to install missing Xiaomi apps on the Redmi 8: </p>
<p> Navigate to APK Mirror with your browser. You can find MIUI Contacts and dialer, here, and MIUI Messaging, here. </p>
<p> Accept the installation from third-party sources when prompted. </p>
<p> Make sure you are signed in with your Mi Account and check the Sync settings to ensure that all your messages, call logs, and contacts are back. </p>
<p> 6. Can’t change fonts on Redmi 8 </p>
<p> Due to some regional limitations, certain world regions do not support some features. For example, Face Unlock is not available in all regions. The same goes for Themes. Now, every region is supported by Themes but some are quite limited in regards to content and customization features. </p>
<p> So, in order to circumvent these limitations, you should just change the region. That should allow you to change fonts. Alternatively, you can download and apply themes as MTZ files and apply them manually. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to change the region on your Redmi 8: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Additional options. </p>
<p> Select Region. </p>
<p> Choose Hong Kong or India. </p>
<p> 7. Overheating issues </p>
<p> Some users reported overheating issues with the Redmi 8, especially when charging the device. It’s hard to determine, by touch, how hot the device is. It’s also important to know that, if reaches critical temperatures, the device will shut down to prevent fatal hardware damage. </p>
<p> For the time being, we have a few things to suggest in order to prevent overheating: </p>
<p> Remove the protective case. </p>
<p> Don’t use your device while charging. </p>
<p> Turn on Airplane mode while charging. </p>
<p> 8. Apps crashing </p>
<p> Others have had a hard time with app crashes, especially system apps that came pre-installed with the OS. This is, almost certainly, an issue with the current version of MIUI and updates should address it completely. So make sure to keep your device up to date. </p>
<p> For the time being, you can try to boot into safe mode and look for improvements. Clearing cache and data from apps that crash is not a bad idea as well. Finally, you might want to reset your device to factory settings. Just don’t forget to back up your data prior to resetting the device. </p>
<p> 9. Contacts and Call history not syncing </p>
<p> This issue also lies in the lack of old Xiaomi apps like Contacts, Messaging, and Dialer. Without them, you won’t be able to sync your contacts, call logs, or SMS messages history. </p>
<p> Just make sure to install APKs of the said apps, as explained above, and they should sync immediately. </p>
<p> 10. Ghost touch issues </p>
<p> Ghost touch is the last thing anyone wants to experience on their smartphone. But, based on a few reports, we found out that Redmi 8 has ghost touch issues on some firmware versions. Now, we are usually blaming the software for occurrences like this, and those are resolved with updates. </p>
<p> However, just to be sure that your device doesn’t have a flawed display, make sure to follow these steps: </p>
<p> Turn the “Double tap to wake or turn off screen” off. </p>
<p> Remove the screen protector. </p>
<p> Clear the screen with a wet cloth. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 11. Redmi 8 restarts on its own </p>
<p> Some users reported that the device tends to restart on its own, which, more time than not, points towards a hardware failure. Nonetheless, you can try and boot the device in safe mode and, if that fails, reset the device to factory settings from the recovery or system settings. </p>
<p> If that doesn’t help, make sure to contact the seller and ask for repair or replacement. </p>
<p> 12. Battery draining fast </p>
<p> The Redmi 8 comes with a quite large 5000 mAh battery that provides remarkable Screen-on time. A large battery along with a relatively compact screen (by today’s standards, at least) should keep your phone off the charger for a couple of days. </p>
<p> On the other hand, it seems that some updates reduced battery life significantly for so many users. We expect that future updates will resolve the problem and optimize performance. </p>
<p> For the time being, try these steps in order to prolong battery life on the Redmi 8: </p>
<p> Disable Automatic brightness and set the brightness manually. </p>
<p> Open Developer options and disable Mobile Data always on. </p>
<p> Prevent some secondary apps from working in the background. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth overnight. </p>
<p> Use Greenify or any other third-party application to limit the background processes. </p>
<p> Update your device or reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 13. How to use Gcam on Redmi 8 </p>
<p> Xiaomi and its subsidiaries sell devices with amazing hardware but there are still some things, especially in the camera optimization and image processing, that still needs some polishing. This is, however, easy to overcome with a Gcam port. </p>
<p> Thanks to these ports, Google’s camera software with advanced color science and processing techniques heavily enhance photo-shooting capabilities of any device. </p>
<p> So, we highly recommend trying Gcam ports on your device. Follow these steps to download and install Gcam on Redmi 8: </p>
<p> In Google Chrome on your handset, navigate to the Gcam Hub, here, and download one of the versions by tapping on it. Alternatively, you can get one of these ports. </p>
<p> Allow installation of apps from third-party sources when prompted. </p>
<p> You can download the configuration files for the second version, here, and add them by following the instructions provided, here. </p>
<p> Install Gcam and that’s it. You can tweak some options in Settings to your liking. Enjoy. </p>
<p> 14. Call recording option is missing </p>
<p> The aforementioned switch from Xiaomi apps to Google apps in global ROMs left a lot of people mad. Mainly because the once-stock Dialer has a call recording feature that Google’s Phone app doesn’t. </p>
<p> And, as explained above, you can get the APKs of all major apps, including the Dialer. Once you sideload the Dialer app and make it your default Dial app, you should be able to record calls without any issues. </p>
<p> 15. Repetitive sound when locking the device </p>
<p> If the sound is repetitive, this is probably a bug. However, there’s a Screen Locking sound which you can disable in Additional Sound settings. This should prevent any sound when the device is unlocked or locked. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to disable Screen Locking sound on the Redmi 8: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Sound & vibration. </p>
<p> Scroll to the bottom and open Additional settings. </p>
<p> Toggle off the Screen locking sounds. </p>
<p> 16. The notification not available on the Lock Screen </p>
<p> Other users have had issues with Lock Screen notifications. Based on reports, even after enabling notifications to fully show on the Lock Screen. Now, there’s hardly anything we can do but to suggest checking all apps individually, besides the general settings. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to ensure that notifications are shown on the Lock Screen: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Notifications. </p>
<p> Choose Lock screen notifications. </p>
<p> Tap Format and select Show notification content. </p>
<p> Make sure that all apps are allowed to show content based on the list below. </p>
<p> After that, you can navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage and open apps individually. </p>
<p> In there, you would select Notifications and roam through various options and sections. Besides global, each app has independent settings for various sections (e.g. Instagram has Instagram Direct, Direct Requests, Comment Likes, etc.). Make sure that Screen lock notifications are at “Show notification content” for each section. </p>
<p> 17. Can’t change the Lock Screen wallpaper </p>
<p> MIUI has certain limitations when it comes to tweaking Lock Screen from the 3rd-party apps. The safest way to change the Lock Screen wallpaper on MIUI 10 or MIUI 11 is to navigate to Settings > Wallpapers and select the wallpaper from there. </p>
<p> Once you’ve done that, just choose the Lock Screen and your wallpaper should be set. This way, you can set both standard and live wallpapers. </p>
<p> 18. Gyroscope issues </p>
<p> Issues like this are quite rare but massive manufacturing of handheld devices eventually leads to flaws. Now, all you can do before replacing the device is to test it with the CIT menu. The problem might lie in a third-party app that’s utilizing the gyroscope. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to check gyroscope with CIT on Redmi 8: </p>
<p> Tap My device. </p>
<p> Select All specs. </p>
<p> Tap on the Kernel version 3 times to open CIT. </p>
<p> Here you can test whether the gyroscope on your Redmi 8 behaves as it should or it is broken by looking at the XYZ coordinates. </p>
<p> 19. Common troubleshooting steps for the Redmi 8 </p>
<p> Enter Developer options </p>
<p> Open Settings </p>
<p> Select My device </p>
<p> Tap All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number. </p>
<p> Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options. </p>
<p> Boot the device into Safe Mode </p>
<p> Turn the device off. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and then, once the Xiaomi logo appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down button. </p>
<p> To exit Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Reset the device to Factory Settings </p>
<p> Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>

<p> Redmi K20 Pro / Mi 9T Pro common problems and how to solve them </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro (also known as the Mi 9T Pro outside India) feels like a sure bet. It successfully bridges the gap between the flagship and budget segments by bringing the best of both worlds. The flagship-level specs at the budget price. </p>
<p> This business model has already proven to be a recipe for success in recent years. Smartphone prices are going through the roof, and customers are looking for the remedy in models like this. That’s why the Pocophone F1 was big last year, and that’s why the K20 Pro /Mi 9T Pro threatens to take its place as the people’s champion now (at least until Xiaomi throws the Poco F2 at us). And most importantly, that’s why you ended up buying this phone. </p>
<p> Many reviewers will tell you that because of the phone’s cost, you have to be content with potential downsides and issues. I would like to argue with that. If you bought the Redmi K20/Mi 9T Pro, you clearly want the most for your money. So, just because you didn’t pay $1000+, doesn’t mean you must let the problems sit there like they’re part of the deal. Instead, you should go and try your best to resolve them. </p>
<p> And that brings us to the main point of this article. I’ve gone through various forums online and concluded a list of the most common problems (and fixes) with the Redmi K20 Pro/Mi 9 T. So, in case you encountered any issue with your brand new phone, I hope you’ll find the solution here. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching it, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Wi-Fi not working </p>
<p> The problem with connecting to Wi-Fi isn’t a widespread problem. But that doesn’t really matter to you if you’re currently experiencing this issue. So, in case you’re unable to properly connect to a Wi-Fi network, try some of the following solutions: </p>
<p> Delete all networks and try reconnecting. </p>
<p> Disable Always On for Mobile Data in Developer options. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Reset App Preferences. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Open Settings > More > Reset WLAN, mobile & Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 2. Popup camera not working </p>
<p> The popup camera is surely the K20 Pro’s highlight feature. However, some users reported that it doesn’t always work as intended. You certainly don’t want your camera to fail at popping up every time, especially if you’re already skeptical about this technology. </p>
<p> When you experience this issue, there’s really nothing you can do about it, software-wise. You either wait for a potential system update that will address the problem, or replace your phone. </p>
<p> Luckily, you’re closer to the first option. Xiaomi already released an update that addresses the popup camera issue, per 91Mobiles. So, if you haven’t already, go on and update your phone. Hopefully, the problem will be resolved. </p>
<p> 3. Screen flickering </p>
<p> The Redmi 20 Pro’s AMOLED screen is another reason why many users upgraded to this phone. The display may not be the best in the business, but it still provides a satisfying experience. </p>
<p> However, a few users reported strange screen flickering when the display is set to low brightness. If you recently encountered such a problem, try some of the following solutions: </p>
<p> Update your phone. Xiaomi should eventually release a patch. </p>
<p> Adjust brightness. </p>
<p> Install the OLED Saver app as a temporary solution until Xiaomi fixes the problem. </p>
<p> 4. Microphone not working </p>
<p> Microphone issue shouldn’t be widespread, as I only found a single report in the forums. Nevertheless, people who encountered this issue suggest restarting Google Assistant as a solution. So, that’s what I’m going to recommend, as well. </p>
<p> Google services > Search, Assistant & Voice > Google Assistant > Assistant tab > Phone > Google Assistant toggle OFF </p>
<p> Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Go to Search, Assistant & Voice > Google Assistant. </p>
<p> Head over to the Assistant tab, find your phone and tap it. </p>
<p> Toggle Google Assistant off. </p>
<p> Now, restart your phone, and check if the microphone started working. To re-enable Google Assistant, repeat the procedure above, and toggle it on. </p>
<p> 5.Headphones not playing music </p>
<p> The same thing goes for headphones. If your Bluetooth headphones are not playing music, try the following solution: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Sound > Earphones > Headphones and audio effects. </p>
<p> Choose the Control volume button option. </p>
<p> 6. Random reboots </p>
<p> I’ve only seen reports of random reboots from users who are on custom ROMs. So, if you’ve recently encountered a similar problem, I’m assuming you’re also using a custom ROM. </p>
<p> Flashing custom ROMs is already a journey of its own and the issues which might occur are probably well-known to all advanced users. And since we’re not writing about custom ROMs here, try searching for a solution someplace else, where people are people are dealing with similar issues, like the XDA forums. </p>
<p> If you can’t find a solution after all, I’d suggest reflashing the stock ROM and sticking with it for some time. At least until developers of your current ROM deal with all the potential problems. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I certainly hope you found a solution to your problem, or at least you understand it better now. If you have any comments, questions, or a problem I didn’t mention in this article, feel free to write it down in the comments below. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 common problems and how to fix them </p>
<p> The Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 is an exceptional budget device. It packs a solid set of specs and build quality, which makes it quite appealing to buyers in its price range. </p>
<p> A friend of mine recently got this device, and he’s very content with it. It easily gets him through the day with the 4000 mAh battery, and it’s also a smooth ride, thanks to 6GB of RAM and the Snapdragon 660. </p>
<p> However, just like any other phone (including much pricier models), the Redmi Note 7 has its own minor issues. Most of them happen in individual cases, but they’re still issues. So, if you recently encountered a problem with your brand new Redmi Note 7, I hope you’ll find a solution in this article. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching it, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1: Touch too sensitive </p>
<p> The first thing you’ll probably notice when using the Note 7 for the first time is that its display is probably more sensitive than what you’re used to. This is not a bug per se, it’s just how the display was made. </p>
<p> So, there’s really nothing you can do about it, because there’s no way to adjust the sensitivity with software. You can actually try a different screen protector, but I’m not sure how much it will help. </p>
<p> 2: GPS problem </p>
<p> Reportedly, GPS malfunction is a widespread problem on the Note 7. Apps like Google Maps or Waze fail to establish a connection with the GPS service, which basically renders them unusable. </p>
<p> Luckily, you’re not powerless when it comes to solving this problem. The first solution I have in mind is simply keeping your MIUI version up to date. Xiaomi will eventually release a fix (if it already hasn’t), and the problems should vanish. </p>
<p> But if the problem persists, even with the latest MIUI version installed on your phone, there’s an additional step I found on the MIUI forum you could try. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Dual Apps. </p>
<p> Turn on Google services. </p>
<p> Toggle on the apps you have problems with (Uber, Waze, etc.) </p>
<p> Tap the Battery icon. </p>
<p> Tap Go to Settings under App Battery Saver. </p>
<p> Click Google Maps/Waze/etc. </p>
<p> The ‘dual version’ of the select app will appear on your Home Screen. Use this version until Xiaomi fixes the GPS problem with an update. </p>
<p> Keep in mind this method only works with third-party apps like Uber or Waze. Meaning you can’t use Dual Apps to make GPS working in Google apps like Google Maps. For these apps, you’ll have to wait for Xiaomi to release an update. </p>
<p> 3: Battery drains </p>
<p> On paper, the Redmi Note 7 boasts a great battery capacity, that’s at the very top of its class. But when it comes to real life usage, the battery life is, well, also great. For some users. The others, less fortunate ones, have to deal with a strange drain that drastically shortens the battery life. </p>
<p> As it’s usually the case with battery drains on a new phone, the cause is unknown. It could be a software problem caused by a recent update, or the issue might be on your end. </p>
<p> According to the forums, it’s probably not your fault, as your current MIUI version drains more battery than it should. You guessed it, the solution is to wait for an update that will (hopefully) improve the battery life. </p>
<p> While you’re waiting for that rescuing update, here are a few things you can try to improve the battery life: </p>
<p> Uninstall battery consuming apps. Check the battery usage per app by going to Settings > Battery & performance > Power usage. </p>
<p> Turn off system animations: Settings > Additional settings > Accessibility > Remove animations. </p>
<p> Restrict background app processes: Settings > Additional settings > Developer options > Background process limit > reduce the number of background processes. </p>
<p> Disable automatic brightness: Settings > Display > Brightness level > disable automatic brightness and adjust it manually. </p>
<p> 4: Background apps closing </p>
<p> As much as the previous solutions are helpful for extending the battery life on your Note 7, they also require compromises. Because you simply cannot have one thing without sacrificing another. Xiaomi knows this, so the company actually made some efforts to automatize that “sacrificing process” and make power management easier for users. That’s how a feature called MIUI optimization was introduced. </p>
<p> This feature automatically restricts certain processes on your phone, in order to extend the battery life while eliminating the need for any tweaks on users’ end. Sure, MIUI Optimization improves power management, but compromises are sometimes too big for users to bear with. </p>
<p> In the Note 7’s case, the MIUI optimization feature seems to automatically close the apps running in the background. Usually, that shouldn’t bother you, but if the apps you regularly use are being constantly closed, you’d probably want this to stop happening. </p>
<p> The obvious solution for this is to disable the MIUI Optimization feature. Yes, disabling it will slightly shrink the battery life, but you probably won’t even notice the difference. What makes the case for disabling this feature even stronger are reports of MIUI Optimization interfering with some non-MIUI based apps, eventually causing even more problems, as mentioned in this forum post. </p>
<p> To disable MIUI Optimization, you need to have Developer options enabled first. To enable Developer options, go to Settings > About Phone > tap the MIUI version 7 times, until the message saying “You’re now a developer!” appears. </p>
<p> Now that we have access to Developer options, here’s how to disable MIUI Optimization: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Additional settings > Developer options. </p>
<p> Find MIUI Optimization, and disable it. </p>
<p> 5: Face unlock not working </p>
<p> This one is as old as the face unlocking technology in Xiaomi phones. And the answer to the question “why can’t I use the Face unlock feature on my brand new Xiaomi phone” is always the same. It’s not available in your region! </p>
<p> Face unlock is restricted in most areas of the world. Some regions will get this feature with future system updates, some won’t. So, if you’re in an unsupported region, but still want to be able to unlock your phone with your face, the only solution is to switch to a supported region. </p>
<p> Your best bet, in this case, is Hong Kong, since the Face Unlock on the Redmi Note 7 is confirmed to work in this region. To change your phone’s region, go to Settings > Additional Settings > Region, and set it to Hong Kong. </p>
<p> 6: Notifications not showing </p>
<p> And finally, a problem that’s common to many Xiaomi phones. You probably find it very annoying that notifications only briefly show in the bar next to the clock, and the immediately disappear. </p>
<p> This wouldn’t even make it to the list of problems if the Note 7 had a huge notch. There simply wouldn’t be enough space for additional icons. But since the Note 7 features a teardrop notch, there’s plenty of space left for notifications. </p>
<p> Apparently, the current version of MIUI (10.3.6 at the time of writing) isn’t well optimized for different notch sizes. So, the pattern stays the same, regardless of whether your phone has a gigantic notch, or just a teardrop. </p>
<p> There are rumors MIUI 11 will fix this inconvenience. So, the only thing left for you is to bear with disappearing icons, and hope the next system version (expected in a month or two) will deal with this. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I certainly hope this article helped you resolve (or at least better understand) your problems with the Note 7. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, just write them down in the comments below. </p>

<p> Redmi Note 8 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Xiaomi doesn’t play around and the output of devices they introduce yearly is crazy for all industry standards. Not even 8 months after the Chinese giant introduced the Redmi Note 7 (and its variations, 7S and 7 Pro), the Redmi Note 8 (along with 8 Pro and 8T) have hit the market. </p>
<p> This appears to be a great device, just like its predecessor, with the Penta-camera (if we include the selfie cam) setup being the major upgrade over the Redmi Note 7. The device has its flaws but they are hard not to look over considering the price point of Note 8. </p>
<p> Today, we made sure to provide you with the list of the most common Redmi Note 8 issues with applicable solutions. If you have any problems with the device, continue reading below or just jump to a section of your interest. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Touchscreen is laggy </p>
<p> Some users reported that the touchscreen (display) is laggy and that was later identified as a software issue on the official global ROM. In our knowledge, the problem is dealt with on later updates. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, if the display is laggy or animations are slow, make sure to follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > My device > System and check for updates. Install an update if available. </p>
<p> Enable Developer options (Settings > My device > All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number). Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options and disable MIUI Optimization at the bottom. </p>
<p> Get back in Developer options and reduce Animation from 1 to 0.5. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings (the procedure is explained at the bottom of this article). </p>
<p> 2. Battery drain issues </p>
<p> Although the 4000 mAh battery should be big enough to give the Redmi Note 8 an exquisite Screen-on Time, users are reporting issues with battery drains. There are multiple things that might affect battery life but, when it comes to MIUI-powered devices, our first suspect is a lack of optimization on the current ROM. </p>
<p> Updates cause battery drains and new updates usually solve them. So, first of all, make sure that your Redmi Note 8 is up to date in regards to the firmware. After that, you can check these tips to reduce battery drains significantly: </p>
<p> Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Disable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and individually disable Autostart on apps. </p>
<p> Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery. </p>
<p> 3. SIM card won’t activate </p>
<p> Moving on, there are reports about the SIM card not working. Namely, it seems that the SIM card won’t activate on this handset for some European and Asian users. Now, we need you to ensure that your device is on the Global MIUI ROM where all necessary bands are available. </p>
<p> If that’s the case, try reinserting the SIM card into the alternative socket and try again. Make sure to reboot your device after doing so. If the problem is still persistent, update the firmware or reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> There’s a slight chance that we are looking at the manufacturing defect, so you can also contact your retailer for service. </p>
<p> 4. Notification icons not showing </p>
<p> Missing notifications on MIUI is probably the longest-running problem Xiaomi/Redmi users experienced. The fact that someone at their software development department decided that it’s a good idea for notification icons to disappear after a few seconds from the Status bar is preposterous. </p>
<p> Luckily, you don’t have to worry about that the moment MIUI gets available. Which already is, although based on Android 9 Pie instead of Android 10. </p>
<p> The problem with notifications is completely solved on MIUI 11, but if you are still not seeing notification icons, here’s how to enable them with ease: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open Display. </p>
<p> Select Notch & status bar. </p>
<p> Under the Status bar section, enable Show icons for incoming notifications. </p>
<p> 5. Low sound volume on headphones </p>
<p> This is also quite a common occurrence, especially on wireless (Bluetooth) headphones or buds. Users say that the volume on their headphones is not high at all, even on the highest settings. Seemingly, there is a workaround to it and we already wrote about it, here. </p>
<p> What you need to do is toggle on the Disable absolute volume option in the Developer options menu. </p>
<p> An alternative is to tweak audio output with certain Magisk modules, which requires root. We don’t recommend that approach if you are not experienced with modding ROMs. </p>
<p> 6. Google Assistant not working </p>
<p> Another quite common problem reported on various forums concerns Google Assistant that won’t work on the Redmi Note 8. The Voice Match for Google Assistant’s voice commands appears greyed out for some users. </p>
<p> This problem seems to be related to MIUI, both 10 and 11, and we don’t have any official response by Xiaomi. There are some things you can try in order to resolve this but, as we said already, this is a widespread issue and, until Xiaomi resolves the problem with their OS skin, we can mainly wait. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to try and solve Google Assistant not working on Redmi Note 8: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Google and clear cache and data. </p>
<p> Leave the Google Beta program from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Uninstall Google updates and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings > Apps > Manage apps. Tap on the 3-dot menu and open Default apps. From there, open Assist & voice input. Under the Assist app, select Google. </p>
<p> Delete and retrain the Voice model. </p>
<p> 7. The Call recording option is missing </p>
<p> This isn’t a bug or anything similar. Namely, due to rules in different regions and in accordance with Google’s privacy regulations (they paid a hefty fee for privacy infringement case), Xiaomi won’t deliver their Contacts and dialer app with an option to record calls. This option is not allowed in Europe and various other regions around the globe. </p>
<p> So, if you badly want this option, consider unlocking the bootloader and flashing either an official ROM from supported regions or flashing Xiaomi EU ROM that has it. </p>
<p> 8. Delay on Lock Screen </p>
<p> This can fall into the overall lag issues with the device but we decided to give it a separate spot on the list. Namely, some users have said that there’s an unexpected 4 seconds delay when they are on the Lock Screen and just after unlocking the device. </p>
<p> For the time being, we don’t have many insights to offer but you can try disabling Tap to wake and disabling the double-press Power button to start a camera. Alternatively, you should ensure that the firmware is up to date or reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 9. GCAM not working on Note 8 </p>
<p> One of the best things about the Redmi Note 8 is that it supports Google Camera ports without rooting your device. Although you won’t be able to utilize all lenses with GCAM, the standard mode photography along with the Night Mode are much better than on the stock camera app. </p>
<p> However, since the device is (still) new, users run into a lot of GCAM ports that crash or won’t work in certain mods. We recommend downloading the GCAM from an acknowledged developer, here. </p>
<p> Just make sure to, before you run the app for the first time, clear all cache and data. That will prevent crashes. </p>
<p> 10. Tips: How to wipe cache partition or factory reset Redmi Note 8 </p>
<p> Finally, we made sure to provide you with two valuable procedures that, if things go awry, might help you get your device in the working condition again. </p>
<p> Here’s how to wipe cache partition on Redmi Note 8 and solve certain issues: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> And this is how to reset your device to factory settings: </p>
<p> Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> Additionally, if you dislike bloatware that comes with MIUI, we have just the right article for you. Learn how to easily debloat your Redmi Note 8 with the steps explained here. No unlocking bootloader or root needed. </p>
<p> With that side note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and we hope this piece shed some light on issues you experienced.

<p> Redmi Note 9 Pro common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Hyper-production in Xiaomi’s factories never stops. And, just as we are got used to a certain midrange device from Redmi, here comes its successor. Redmi Note 8 was a great budget device, but what about Redmi Note 9 and it’s top segment model with the PRO as a suffix? The Redmi Note 9 Pro is a great bang for your buck, that’s for certain. </p>
<p> What about everyday use and issues that emerged, plaguing owners of this device? No worries, we got your back. We conducted in-depth research and provided you with the list of most common issues along with solutions. All of you Redmi Note 9 Pro users — read below! </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Lift to wake not working </p>
<p> Some Redmi Note 9 Pro users reported issues with the Rise to wake feature. This feature is quite handy and definitely available on all contemporary Android devices, including the latest Redmi 9 lineup. </p>
<p> Firstly, make sure that the feature is enabled. Navigate to Settings > Display and enable Rise to wake there. If it still doesn’t work, the problem is a system bug resolvable with a simple reboot. </p>
<p> However, if you are still unable to address it, updating your firmware or, alternatively, resetting your device to factory settings should resolve the issue. </p>
<p> 2. Battery draining fast </p>
<p> With its enormous 5020 mAh battery, the Redmi Note 9 Pro should provide users with a quite good SoT (Screen-on Time). However, Xiaomi’s MIUI is often hit or miss with the optimization and, for some, the battery depletes fast. </p>
<p> The most probable reason is the deep sleep integration, as the device is depleting even when the device is idle. </p>
<p> Firstly, we recommend updating your device. Don’t forget to send feedback and report issues to Xiaomi. In addition, these steps might help you prolong battery life significantly: </p>
<p> Turn off Wi-Fi and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Disable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Disable unused apps from starting automatically. Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and individually disable Autostart on apps. </p>
<p> Use manual brightness settings, it will save you a lot of battery. </p>
<p> Try calibrating your battery. Follow the steps provided, here. </p>
<p> 3. Instagram video stutters </p>
<p> Issues with Instagram and Xiaomi devices appear to be quite common. Some users have problems with recording lengthy Stories (over 20 seconds), others experience stutters while recording videos within the app. </p>
<p> Now, Instagram does lower the framerate but we can’t say with certainty why the videos will stutter. Make sure to reinstall the app and grant it all necessary permissions and look for improvement. </p>
<p> 4. Slow-motion videos are not recorded </p>
<p> Xiaomi finally decided to put some more effort into the software part of the photo-taking capabilities of their devices. </p>
<p> Despite the great hardware, the lackluster software made users switch to Google Camera ports modded by third-party developers. Things are getting better with MIUI 12, but there’s still a lot of work to do. </p>
<p> Some Redmi Note 9 Pro users reported issues with the slow-motion videos which are not saving after being recorded. </p>
<p> We advise you to update your device and, like with most of the issues we placed on the list, send the feedback to Xiaomi informing them about the issue. You can also clear data and cache from the Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Camera. </p>
<p> 5. Wi-Fi disconnecting with the screen off </p>
<p> This one is, by far, the most common and the most excruciating issue that many of the Redmi Note 9 Pro users encountered. Namely, whatever users do and regardless of the Wi-Fi stability, it seems that their devices keep disconnecting. </p>
<p> Xiaomi allegedly acknowledged the issue but to no avail, as even after updates, the problem persists. </p>
<p> Resetting Network settings doesn’t help as well as resetting the device to factory values. Just make sure to install all recent updates and, if the issue persists, ask for the replacement. </p>
<p> 6. Low volume on Bluetooth headphones </p>
<p> Unlike many flagships, the Redmi Note 9 Pro comes with the headphone jack. Nonetheless, some users will still utilize Bluetooth to reproduce audio wirelessly. And, that’s where the issues start for some. </p>
<p> It seems that the volume on wireless headphones or speakers is too low even on the highest setting. If that’s the case for you, we suggest navigating to Developer options and tweaking a few settings there. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Open About phone. </p>
<p> Locate the Build number and tap it 7 times in succession to enable Developer options. </p>
<p> Now, you should see Developer options in Settings > System. </p>
<p> Scroll down until you reach the Networking section. </p>
<p> Once there, enable (toggle ON) the Disable absolute volume option. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and you should have more control over the volume of Bluetooth devices. </p>
<p> 7. Display bleeding and image retention issues </p>
<p> The worst thing that can happen to an LCD IPS display is screen bleeding, where one (or multiple) screen edges show stripes of the white light. </p>
<p> This is not as common but some Redmi Note 9 Pro users are definitely seeing this problem on their devices. It seems that the displays that have this factory flaw are the ones with Tianma LCD panels. </p>
<p> Xiaomi and its subsidiaries tend to use Tianma Electronics-made LCD panels a lot and there are no reports about this problem on a plethora of available devices. However, if you are experiencing this issue, ask for the replacement. </p>
<p> To check if the screen bleeding exists, put on a dark image on your background and look at the screen edges at an angle. In regards to image retention, we think that this isn’t as common and that reports are too scarce. </p>
<p> 8. The device won’t update </p>
<p> MIUI is often hit or miss but, in comparison to some other OEMs, Xiaomi (Redmi and Poco, too), tends to provide a lot of timely updates. It takes some time to fix all the things but, in general, the user experience is getting better and more polished with every new iteration. </p>
<p> However, what to do if your device won’t update? Some users are having a hard time, as their device won’t install updates although they are informed that updates are available. </p>
<p> Firstly, we recommend restarting your device. If that doesn’t help, check the available storage and network connection. </p>
<p> Finally, you can reboot your device into Recovery and wipe the cache partition by following steps at the bottom of this article. </p>
<p> 9. Bluetooth won’t connect </p>
<p> Reports of Bluetooth connectivity issues are rather scarce but there are still users having a hard time connecting. It seems that the problem, specifically, affects users that try to connect their Redmi Note 9 Pro to a Car Media in order to play music. </p>
<p> For some of them, the Bluetooth connection is unstable or certain devices (Bluetooth speakers and earbuds) won’t connect at all. </p>
<p> If you are among those users, make sure to try the steps we listed below: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Unpair and pair your handset again with the device. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth A2DP Hardware Offload in Developer Options. </p>
<p> However, since we are covering the Redmi Note 9 Pro, we’ll try and focus on this device solely. </p>
<p> There are two things you can do on your side and they include checking in-app settings first and then system notification settings after. If necessary, do so for each app that’s bothering you. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Select Manage apps. </p>
<p> Open the app that doesn’t provide you with notifications from the list. </p>
<p> Select Notifications. </p>
<p> Ensure that all notifications for various app segments are enabled. You can tweak settings additionally (disable sound or vibration, set custom tones, etc.). </p>
<p> After that, get back to Settings and open Display and Status bar. </p>
<p> Make sure to enable the “Show notification icons” option. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and look for improvements. </p>
<p> You can learn more about addressing notification-related issues in this extensive article. </p>
<p> 11. Cellular signal issues </p>
<p> Good, stable cellular signal reception and reliable network coverage are often neglected when talked about modern smartphones. </p>
<p> Many China-made devices are not supporting all bands in Western countries, which means that network coverage isn’t the best or some carrier-based features are missing. </p>
<p> Some European Redmi Note 9 Pro users have had a hard time with the network coverage, with the lackluster network reception. </p>
<p> In addition, the device might get hot and the battery will deplete rapidly, searching repetitively for a stable signal. </p>
<p> If that’s what’s bothering you, as well, we recommend restarting your device periodically. In addition, make sure that your SIM card is properly placed and try switching between the slots. Alternatively, you can try and reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 12. Camera exposure issues </p>
<p> Some users reported strange issues with the stock MIUI Camera focus and exposure. This is an isolated problem, but it still bothers some users. One of them went as far as replacing its Redmi Note 9 Pro. </p>
<p> If you are troubled by this issue, try clearing the Cache from the Camera app, wiping cache partition data, and updating the firmware. If that doesn’t help, consider restoring factory settings on your device. </p>
<p> You can also try Gcam ports for your device and go with them. Usually, they bring better results than the stock camera app. It shouldn’t be hard getting and installing modded Google Camera APK. </p>
<p> 13. OK Google not working </p>
<p> Google Assistant comes preinstalled on every Android device (except recent Huawei handsets) and it usually, after you set it up, works without issues. Nonetheless, there are reports about OK Google/Google Assistant not working for some Redmi Note 9 Pro users. </p>
<p> For some, the Assistant is not responding with Voice commands. Have in mind that this might be caused by the Wi-Fi bug, as Google’s services require a stable connection. </p>
<p> If you are among the affected users, try using these steps to fix the issue completely: </p>
<p> Check the Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Clear cache from the Google app from Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Google. </p>
<p> Check Voice match recognition in the Assistant settings. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Select Google as the default Voice assistant in Settings > Apps > Manage apps > 3-dot menu > Default apps. </p>
<p> You can learn more about issues with Google Assistant and ways to solve them in this dedicated article. </p>
<p> 14. No HD support for Netflix and Amazon Prime </p>
<p> Chinese ROMs don’t come with the Widevine L1 which means that they can stream content only in SD (Standard Definition) and not HD. However, all devices with Global ROMs or regional ROMs should support HD for Netflix and Amazon Prime. </p>
<p> If you are seeing Widewine L3 instead of L1 (check with the DRM app, get it here), we encourage you to check your ROM. Most custom ROMs don’t support HD streaming so, if that’s important to you, choose custom ROMs wisely. </p>
<p> 15. How to debloat your Redmi Note 9 Pro </p>
<p> As a side note, if you find MIUI to be too much bloated (too many unnecessary system apps), learn how to debloat it and make it both faster and cleaner while significantly improving battery life. Find our article on the subject with detailed instructions, here. </p>

<p> Valuable Tip: How to reduce washed out black contrast on Huawei Mate 9 </p>
<p> Huawei Mate 9 was a breakthrough model of the Chinese giant that made a clear point towards the world market: ”prepare yourself, we are here to compete!” And they truly made an impact. This flagship offers great features, amazing camera, and a phablet-like LCD screen. </p>
<p> However, it’s not all bread and butter with this device. Besides overheating issues and sensitive protective glass, users are having an issue with the color contrast. Mainly with the black nuances that seem washed out under direct sunlight. That may, besides aesthetics, downgrade all-around screen quality. Luckily, there is a way to fix this issue with the few simple tweaks. So, if you’re tired of grayish black on your Huawei Mate 9, follow the instructions below. </p>
<p> How to improve screen contrast on Huawei Mate 9 </p>
<p> This color issue is closely related to ”Increase readability in Sunlight” feature. Its main use is, as you can already assume, to improve readability outdoors, while reading in the direct sunlight. And it’s enabled by default. However, it vastly impacts color contrast, making black looking washed out. </p>
<p> These are the steps you’ll need to follow in order to get your color back: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Navigate to About Phone. </p>
<p> Tap 7 times on Build version number to trigger Developer options. </p>
<p> In Developer options, find ‘‘Increase readability in sunlight” and turn it Off. </p>
<p> Turn off Developer options and clear Settings app data to remove it from Settings menu. </p>
<p> Test your screen outdoors. </p>
<p> You’ll see that the colors are much better placed and with much more contrast than before. Of course, if you’re not satisfied, you can enable ”Increase readability in sunlight” again by following same steps. </p>
<p> That should do it. In case you have any questions or suggestions related to the subject, the comments section is below. </p>

<p> How to remove bloatware from any Xiaomi or Redmi phone </p>
<p> Even though Xiaomi made quite a positive breakthrough with an amazing set of devices for the price, we all know that major downsides of MIUI are ads and bloatware. That’s why we made sure to explain how to, thanks to recognized developer Saki EU, safely remove bloatware from Xiaomi or Redmi devices. </p>
<p> As we all know, great hardware still doesn’t cut it when the software is an underwhelming experience. MIUI 11 fixed those abominations that are ads in the system apps, but there are still some unnecessary apps coming with the ROM. If you want to learn how to remove them, check out the instructions we provided for you. </p>
<p> How can I remove bloatware from my Xiaomi/Redmi phone? </p>
<p> Now, even though Global and EU versions of the ROM are not as bloatware-ridden as the Chinese version, there are some Android purists that don’t like most of them and want them gone. A clear example are users that use Google’s services and apps that all have their counterparts on MIUI. </p>
<p> That’s why we made sure to explain how to use a nifty tool made by a recognized XDA developer that will help you debloat your device in a matter of minutes. No unlocked bootloader or root needed. </p>
<p> You have a lot of different advanced options, but we suggest not meddling with them unless you are certain what are you doing. Stick to removing bloatware for now. Or reinstalling certain apps you mistakenly removed. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to use Xiaomi ADB/Fastboot Tools by Saki EU: </p>
<p> Firstly, let’s enable Developer options. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Tap on All specs. </p>
<p> Now, tap 7 times on the MIUI version to enable Developer Options. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings and open Additional settings. </p>
<p> Open Developer options. </p>
<p> Once there, enable USB debugging, Install via USB, and USB debugging (security settings). </p>
<p> Download and extract the latest Xiaomi ADB/Fastboot Tools by Saki EU on your PC. You can find it on GitHub, here. </p>
<p> Make sure to install the Java Runtime Environment. You can find and download setup, here. </p>
<p> Connect your Xiaomi/Redmi phone to a PC and allow USB Debugging on your handset when prompted. Install drivers if necessary. </p>
<p> Under the App Manager, you’ll see all installed apps, including system apps. The list is curated so don’t worry, you can uninstall (we recommend disabling over uninstalling) all and every app on the list. </p>
<p> Have in mind that certain features won’t function if you delete associated apps so act with caution. Those options (e.g. Quick Ball) might not be of use to some, while they are quite useful for others. </p>
<p> Note: If the tool can’t find ADB/Fastboot even if you are sure everything is properly set, open the folder where the XiaomiADBFastbootTools is. While holding Shift, right-click on the empty area and open Command Prompt or PowerShell. Enter this command java -jar XiaomiADBFastbootTools.jar and press Enter. It should work after that. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. In case you have any questions, suggestions, or thoughts on this tool and MIUI in general, feel free to tell us in the comments section that’s just below. </p>

<p> Hey mate, wanted to say thank you or this one. Really helped out. </p>
<p> not java running error : Exception in thread “main” java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/baeldung/MajorMinorApp has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 55.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0 </p>
<p> I had the same issue even after installing the latest Java Runtime. Install the latest JDK (Java Development Kit) instead. Restart your PC and then double click the jar. That worked for me! </p>
<p> I can’s say with certainty but you can download the tool, connect your device, and try it out. </p>
<p> All apps that are on the list are safe to remove, based on the developer’s explanation. I personally removed all MIUI-default apps and never had an issue. You can always reinstall them or, to be certain that nothing will go awry, disable and enable them again if necessary. I hope that helps. </p>
<p> There’s the Reinstaller tab in the ADB section. Just connect your handset to a PC, enable USB Debugging, and select apps from the list you want to get back. </p>

<p> Fix: Music Player widget stuck on the Lock Screen in iOS 11 </p>
<p> iOS 11 is already showing its flaws. In the sea of reported issues, there’s one problem that’s especially going on users’ nerves. And that’s a bug that causes a music player widget to stay on the Lock Screen even when users don’t want it. </p>
<p> Apparently, the problem doesn’t occur with iPhone’s Music Player only. It also occurs with both Spotify and Apple Music. </p>
<p> So, if you’ve been experiencing this issue lately, let’s see what can we do to get rid of this annoyance </p>
<p> Here are some workarounds that solved the problem for some users: </p>
<p> Reboot your iPhone </p>
<p> A lot of users actually said that a simple reboot resolves this issue. So, before doing anything else, just restart your phone. No need for hard reset or bringing your phone to factory settings. Just a regular reset will do. </p>
<p> However, you should keep in mind that rebooting your phone is just a temporary solution, as the problem will likely appear again. If it doesn’t appear, even better. </p>
<p> But you should probably do something more than just a reset to get rid of the Music Player widget forever. </p>
<p> Open and close the app </p>
<p> Similarly to restarting your phone, opening and closing the app also did the trick for some users. </p>
<p> So, if the widget stays on the Lock Screen, even after you close the app, just open the app again, and close the app from the App Switcher. </p>
<p> But once again, this is just a temporary solution. </p>
<p> Turn Show Apple Music off </p>
<p> This solution, obviously, only applies if Apple Music gives you the sticky widget. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Go to Music </p>
<p> Turn Show Apple Music off </p>
<p> Check for Updates </p>
<p> And finally, if none of the solutions from above managed to resolve the problem for you, there’s probably nothing you can do after all. Except waiting for Apple to release a new update for iOS. </p>
<p> Many users believe this issue is just some bug in iOS 11, and that only Apple can resolve it with a fixing patch. Although this hasn’t been confirmed yet, it makes sense, because iOS 11 is riddled with bugs, and Apple will have hands full of work to bring everything back to normal. </p>
<p> Do you have something more to say about this problem? Maybe an additional solution? Let us know in the comments below. </p>

<p> How to easily get rid of the water from the iPhone speaker </p>
<p> In modern society, the phone becomes an everyday accessory, as its usage exceeded its primary purpose. So, we carry it all the time, browse the internet, watch videos, play games or update on the social network. Every day, 7 days per week. And sometimes it falls by itself or gets itself wet, ain’t it? Accidents happen all the time and you shouldn’t be harsh on yourself. Because, most of the time there is a solution. </p>
<p> You played around with your brand new iPhone 7 and, while concentrated on something else, you managed to drop it in the puddle of water. After the moment of awkward silence, you gave your best to pick it up as fast as you can. But, some water got into the speaker. </p>
<p> iPhone have security measures so it will stop water from getting inside, but it’s still wet and you have to get rid of it as fast as you can. </p>
<p> Don’t worry, we have the solution that Apple already implemented in the Apple Watch. But, in this case, you have to use an application that will get the water out. </p>
<p> How to remove water from iPhone speaker with sound </p>
<p> Yes, you read it right. I’ll explain myself. With the specified frequency, water will bounce out your speaker in no time. And this is how: </p>
<p> Go to App Store and find a free application called Sonic. </p>
<p> This app lets you choose the frequency of played sound. </p>
<p> Select the frequency that is at 165 Hz or close to that value. </p>
<p> When water gets out, use absorbent material to collect drops. </p>
<p> And that’s your solution. Because of this few, easy steps your speaker will be dry as a bone. </p>
<p> If you are having some other issues or anything else concerning iPhone hazards, let us know in the comment section. </p>

<p> How to rename photos and videos in Google Photos </p>
<p> Google Photos is a great service for storing, backing up and sharing your photos. However, it does have certain limitations. For instance, there’s no way to rename synced photos and videos. </p>
<p> If you’re like me, you don’t pay attention to files’ names, so having your photos named something like IMG_20190519_025921 doesn’t bother you at all. But I have a feeling it matters to you. For example, it makes searching for photos and videos possible (it’s always possible, but c’ mon, nobody’s going to remember the default name), and allows you to better organize your memories. </p>
<p> So, how do you rename pictures and videos in Google Photos? Well, it’s not exactly a walk in the park. As a matter of fact, it’s not possible to rename your photos and videos in-app, as Google Photos, for some reason, doesn’t even have this option. </p>
<p> The only thing left for users to do, besides spamming Google’s forums with requests for introducing the renaming feature to Google Photos, is to turn to an alternative, less convenient, more painful solution. </p>
<p> How to rename files in Google Photos </p>
<p> Here’s how to rename your photos and videos in Google Photos: </p>
<p> Open the image you want to rename in Google Photos. </p>
<p> Tap the menu (three dots) in the upper right corner. </p>
<p> Select Save to Device. </p>
<p> Open your File manager app, and find the Photo you just downloaded in the Downloads folder (Files by Google is the best option for this). </p>
<p> Long press the image or video to select it (don’t open it). </p>
<p> Tap the three-dot menu, and choose Rename. </p>
<p> Re-upload the renamed photo or video to Google Photos. </p>
<p> Delete the original file from Google Photos to prevent duplicates. </p>
<p> There you go. I know it’s not what you’re looking for, but at least it’s something. This surely works when you need to rename a file or two, but if you have to rename a bunch of photos and videos, well, it’ll either take hours, or you’ll simply give up. </p>
<p> I hope Google will eventually allow users to rename their files inside the Google Photos app. Until then, you can only use the hard method and hope check for Google Photos updates frequently. </p>
<p> If you know of some more convenient way of renaming files in Google Photos, please share it with us in the comments, I know a lot of people would be thankful. </p>

<p> Can Google recommend an alternative app which enables you to change the name as you create an image? Since Google allows for a lengthy description on each image I can’t see how you appeal to researchers needing to identify multiple files on the search button. It is impossible.I rename mine in PCloud and download again from there which takes too long and allows for human error. </p>

<p> How to restore deleted contacts on Android 10 </p>
<p> Even with all the social media around, the old-fashioned calls and texts haven’t become obscure just yet. That’s why even the 10-year old contacts that survived through several phone changes are still important to you. </p>
<p> And that’s exactly why accidentally deleting or losing those contacts isn’t something you can easily overlook and move away from. Luckily, you’re using an Android phone. And in this ecosystem, many things get to live twice. </p>
<p> In that manner, I’m going to show you how to recover deleted contacts from your Google Account, so you don’t lose touch with old friens you don’t call anyway. </p>
<p> How to recover deleted contacts from your Google Account </p>
<p> Like it or not, Google knows pretty much everything about you. It keeps track of your favorite restaurants, places, topics you like discussing, even people you’re in touch with. Sure, when we look at the bigger picture, this approach has its downsides (like the complete absence of privacy), but in cases like this, it’s Google’s enormous database that will actually save your skin. </p>
<p> There are two ways of restoring deleted contacts from your Google Account. You can access a full backup and bring it back as a whole, or in case you recently deleted a contact you didn’t mean to, you can simply undo changes and the contact will re-appear in your contact list. However, you need Google’s own Contacts app to be able to undo changes. If you’re using a third-party app, or your system’s default contacts app, restoring a full backup is your best bet. </p>
<p> This is how to undo changes in Google’s Contacts app: </p>
<p> Open Contacts. </p>
<p> Open the hamburger menu, and go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Undo changes. </p>
<p> Select the time period you want to undo changes from (you can select up to 30 days back). </p>
<p> Tap Confirm, and all your deleted contacts will re-appear in the list. </p>
<p> Now, in case you don’t use Google’s Contacts app, you’ll have to rely on a backup stored in your Google Account. Here’s how to access and restore the backup of your contacts in your Google Account: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Google > Set up & restore > Restore contacts. </p>
<p> Select the backup you want to restore. </p>
<p> Restore it. </p>
<p> Can I restore deleted contacts without any backup? </p>
<p> Obviously, all of this requires your data to be synced with your Google Account. Since you pretty much can’t use an Android phone without a Google Account, chances are high at least some of your contacts are synced. </p>
<p> However, if for some reason, you don’t have any contacts synced to your Google Account, restoring them might not be that easy. In fact, it could be impossible. </p>
<p> Your only chance of restoring deleted contacts without a Google Account is only if they’re stored on your SIM or SD card. So, go through the contacts app on your phone, and make sure to enable it to display contacts from your SIM card. If you manage to get some of them back, good. If not, I’m afraid your contacts might be lost forever. </p>
<p> Even if you manage to bring some contacts back from your SIM, I still strongly recommend setting up a Google Account backup (or any other backup). Because it’s the only way of keeping your contacts completely safe. </p>

<p> How to restore lost apps and files after installing iOS 12 </p>
<p> The iOS 12 update is finally here and it’s certainly an upgrade over iOS 11. At the time being, users are fairly satisfied with the performance boost and a few minutiae additions. The best thing about iOS is a complete absence of the device fragmentation. But, that might have some initial drawbacks, as it is hard to optimize the OS for so many different devices. Namely, more than a few users lost their data and apps after the iOS 12 update. </p>
<p> We offer a few ways to solve this with the tools you already have in your hands. </p>
<p> 1: Use iTunes or iCloud </p>
<p> Restoring all your data, if it was backed up, of course, is a simple errand. There are two ways to back up your data on any iOS device. You can use the built-in cloud storage called iCloud to back up your data online. The alternative is iTunes, which allows you to store your data locally on a PC or Mac and restore it later on. </p>
<p> The iCloud procedure is automatized and, if you haven’t disabled it, all your data (including 3rd-party apps, settings, configuration) are stored online. You can restore the latest automatized backup or the one you manually created. This stands for both iCloud and iTunes approach. </p>
<p> Now, if you’ve lost your data and apps after the update, you should be able to restore it from iCloud in a few steps. Still, we suggest doing a complete factory reset after the update, which allows you to restore backed up data to a clean slate device. This is a remedy for various iOS 12 post-update issues. </p>
<p> So, with that said, here’s how to restore your data from iCloud: </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Select Restore iPhone. </p>
<p> Move on to restoring process. </p>
<p> 2: Restore apps from the App Store </p>
<p> If you’re missing some apps after the iOS 12 installation, don’t worry. You can restore them without too much effort from the App Store. This feature applies solely to built-in apps, which came pre-installed on iOS. If you’re missing, say, TV, Videos, or Voice Memos apps, they can be reinstalled from the App Store without any data loss. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do to retrieve missing built-in apps: </p>
<p> Open the App Store on your iPhone/iPad. </p>
<p> Search for the app you want to restore and open it. </p>
<p> Tap on the cloud-like icon to restore the saved data for the app. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Of course, in your search for the resolution, you might encounter various third-party tools which are specialized in restoring the lost data from your iPhone. We advise you to avoid them until you don’t have an alternative. It can save you some money. </p>

<p> How to restore missing Google Calendar events in Android </p>
<p> Google Calendar is one of the most used Google organization apps, both for PC and smartphones. Even though it’s simplistic and remarkably useful for professionals or home users, it still looks outdated and neglected by Google. A lot of users had issues with data loss which is probably the worst thing that can happen. </p>
<p> For example, let’s say that you switched to a new device or deleted your associated Gmail account from the actual device. Now, in theory, once you sync data again after re-establishing Gmail account, everything should be there. All events and schedules. But, as some users reported, that’s not the case. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we conducted a research to try and help you resolve the issue at hand and obtain deleted events. For further workarounds, look down below. </p>
<p> Use PC to check the Trash </p>
<p> After some time, Google decided that’s worth to preserve deleted events for 30-days period and let you restore them. You can do this only on PC at this moment. So, if some of your events are missing, you can look up for them in the Trash. If the problem isn’t sync-related, there’s a chance that you’ll be able to locate a missing event in there. </p>
<p> If you’re not sure how to do it, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Open Google Calendar on your PC web browser and sign in with the preferred Gmail account. </p>
<p> Navigate to My Calendar on the left side and open the drop-down menu from your Calendar. </p>
<p> Click View Trash. </p>
<p> There you can find possibly deleted events. </p>
<p> Mark preferred events and click on Restore selected events. </p>
<p> Have in mind that Google Calendar stores only 30-days old deleted events. If you’re unable to find these or even the events can’t be located, move on with the alternative solutions. </p>
<p> Restore backup </p>
<p> It’s a well-known fact that backup is a saver. You should frequently back up everything available in case something goes wrong. The same goes for Google Calendar. There are so many scenarios that can cause data loss, and most of them are not even users’ fault. So, if you’ve exported Google Calendar timely, now you can restore all missing events and resolve the issue in a few easy steps. </p>
<p> Again, you’ll need to use a web browser on your PC and move from there in order to import saved calendars to your Google Account. </p>
<p> From the top right side, open Settings. </p>
<p> Open the Calendars card. </p>
<p> Click Choose file and select the exported file associated with your calendar. </p>
<p> Choose Import. </p>
<p> That should help you retrieve the missing events and resolve the problem. Now, once you’ve synced Google Calendar on your Android handset, you should be able to access all events just like before the issue emerged. And if you’re unsure how to export calendars for further use, these are the instructions you should follow: </p>
<p> Open Google Calendar in your PC web browser. </p>
<p> From the top right side, open Settings. </p>
<p> Open the Calendars card. </p>
<p> Click Export Calendars. </p>
<p> This will initiate an automatic download of your calendars. Calendars will be stored in a ZIP file. </p>
<p> Enable the Events from Gmail feature </p>
<p> Not all events are exclusively generic (holidays or birthdays) or manually created (to-do’s), some of them might come from Gmail. And if your issue is related to Gmail imported events, there might be a simple solution. Google Calendar should be able to access those by default but the settings might have changed after re-establishing the account. </p>
<p> Because of that, we advise you to check Settings and see for yourself: </p>
<p> Open the Google Calendar app on your Android device. </p>
<p> Open the 3-line drop-down menu. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Events from Gmail. </p>
<p> Enable Add events from Gmail. </p>
<p> In addition, make sure that your device’s time and date are properly set. </p>
<p> Clear app’s cache </p>
<p> Stored cache is temporarily useful but, once it piles up, it can cause issues with any app, including the Android native Google Calendar. For that purpose, we advise you to navigate to Apps settings and clear the app cache and then restart your device. That should clear possible stall within the app and resolve the issue at hand. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> If that’s not enough, make sure to check the final workaround we enlisted. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app </p>
<p> At the end, you might want to start from a scratch and reinstall the app. This will result in a fresh automatic restore and, presumably, your missing events should be recovered. On the other hand, if the app is mandatory installed on your device as a built-in tool, you can restore it to factory settings. But, we advise you to rather look for updates. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to reinstall the Google Calendar app: </p>
<p> Open drawer or app menu on your device. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Google Calendar app, draw it to the top and Uninstall it. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Open Play Store and search for Google Calendar. </p>
<p> Tap Install. </p>
<p> After the procedure is finished, check for the missing events within the app. </p>
<p> That should do it. We certainly hope that this was a useful read for you. Don’t forget that you have many alternative clients, so if you have had hard times in the past, you can always try an alternative. In case you have any questions, suggestions or even remarks, we’ll be glad to hear from you. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> None of the above solutions worked for me. I had the same issue with Samsung/Google Calendars. My calendar entries in app(s) disappeared all of a sudden while being visible on Google Calendar web app. Here’s what worked for me. </p>
<p> Possible Solution 1. Delete the calendar data in settings – Settings > Apps > Calendar > Storage > Clear Data 2. Manually resync in app – Calendar App > Hamburger Menu (3 lines icon) > Sync Now </p>

<p> Ignore what the article says about checking the Google calender bin (or trash as they refer to it, though Google calls it bin) only being possible on a PC. That’s nonsense, all you have to do is go to the calendar using a browser on your mobile device and in the page options/settings select the checkbox that says ‘desktop site’ and you’ll have exactly the same access as when using a PC – simple! </p>

<p> Very interesting article. I have a problem. Google calendar events in my PC, older than 5 years vanish on a daily basis. I have been using google calendar for about 10 years and I cant stop this from happening. Everything from 5 years ago through 10 years ago is gone. I haven’t found any way to retrieve old events and even if I did they would undoubtedly disappear again. Is there a way to set google calendar NOT to delete old events and to retrieve lost ones? Thanks. </p>

<p> Fix: Samsung Galaxy S10 data issues </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy S10 series brought a lot of goods in a similar package as their predecessors, as expected for flagship series of probably best smartphone hardware manufacturers out there. However, the novel OneUI 2 needs some ironing. There seems to be a string of different S10 data issues (Wi-Fi issues, as well). The connection is either unstable (and super-slow) or the device won’t connect to 4G/LTE at all. </p>
<p> If you are experiencing data issues, make sure to check the steps below in order to fix them for good. </p>
<p> How do I fix my S10 connection? </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Reset your APN to default values </p>
<p> The first thing to try in order to resolve Samsung Galaxy S10 data issues is to reset your APN settings. There might be a problem with the local configuration. Also, make sure that your Preferred network type includes LTE/4G. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reset APN to default values: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select Connections. </p>
<p> Choose Mobile networks and then Access Point Names. </p>
<p> Tap on the Menu and then select Reset to default. </p>
<p> If you are still experiencing issues, make sure to contact your carrier’s call center and ask for a new APN configuration. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Some users managed to resolve the issue by wiping the cache partition from the Recovery menu. Some suggested resetting network settings after this action, but we suggest taking additional steps only if the issue persists. </p>
<p> If you are not sure how to wipe cache partition on the Samsung Galaxy S10, make sure to follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Power off your Samsung Galaxy S10. </p>
<p> Simultaneously press and hold the Power button, Volume up, and the Bixby button until the Android logo appears. </p>
<p> After that, you should see the Recovery menu. </p>
<p> Once there, use the volume keys to navigate through the menu and press the Power button to select wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Choose Yes and press the Power button to wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Disable Adaptive data usage </p>
<p> Another thing we recommend doing is disabling the Adaptive data usage when Wi-Fi is unstable. When enabled, this option allows for smart switching between Wi-Fi networks and mobile data. However, it has caused some issues with Samsung’s OneUI 2 and the Samsung Galaxy S10. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do in order to disable automatic use of mobile data on your device: </p>
<p> Choose Connections. </p>
<p> Select Wi-Fi and enable it. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and choose Advanced. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reset Network settings </p>
<p> If the data issues persist on the S10, it would be a good idea to reset Network settings. Have in mind that this will erase all save SSIDs and Bluetooth pairings. Once you reset network settings, your carrier should provide you with configuration messages for 4G/LTE and MMS. Make sure to apply them. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset your Samsung Galaxy S10 network settings: </p>
<p> Choose General management. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Select Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Update the S10 firmware and contact your service provider </p>
<p> It is talked a lot about connectivity issues concerning Samsung’s flagship series. The OEM decided to address them and, based on multiple reports, most of the issues are fixed with a patch. So, ensure that your device’s firmware is up to date. </p>
<p> In addition, the problem might be associated with carrier coverage issues so, if the problem persists, make sure to contact your carrier. Especially if you got the carrier SIM-locked device. They should give you a better insight. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the aforementioned steps proved fruitful, the only thing we can recommend is resetting your Samsung Galaxy S10 to factory settings. Just make sure to back up all your data prior to resetting your phone. This procedure will erase everything, including your internal storage. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reset your Samsung Galaxy S10 to factory settings: </p>
<p> Back up everything from your internal storage to an SD card or cloud. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose General management and then Reset. </p>
<p> Select Factory data reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset and then tap Delete all. </p>
<p> With that said, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to tell us about alternative solutions or different issues you are experiencing. You can do so in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: Samsung Galaxy S10 is overheating </p>
<p> Samsung’s Galaxy series are regarded as the top-of-the-line flagship devices. However, even the best of the best can have occasional issues, sometimes, quite the concerning ones. One frequently reported issue is the Samsung Galaxy S10 overheating. This usually happens during charging, however, some users experienced heat issues even when the device was idle. Learn how to address this in the step-by-step list below. </p>
<p> Why is my Samsung Galaxy s10 getting hot? </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Remove the protective casing </p>
<p> Start by removing the protective casing. Especially, when charging the device. Certain materials will heavily impact the heat-retention and your device won’t be able to cool down after charging or during heavy use. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Disable some background services </p>
<p> Alternatively, if the device heats up even during regular use, make sure to disable some background processes. Many users reported that their device started overheating in the first 30 minutes of usage, so we suggest inspecting all apps that work in the background and limiting the activity of the non-essential ones. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to check active apps and disable them from auto-starting: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Locate individual apps that are using more resources and disable auto-start or uninstall them. You can also boot into safe mode and look for improvements. If everything is working as intended, uninstalling recently-installed third-party apps is recommended. </p>
<p> After you’ve disabled some apps, make sure to reboot your Samsung Galaxy S10, and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Stick to the factory charger </p>
<p> Even though, in theory, most of the chargers will work without issues but we still suggest sticking to the out-of-the-box charger and USB – Type C data cable. </p>
<p> The original cable and adapter won’t cause overheating issues on the Samsung Galaxy S10 as some third-party options might. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reduce animations and screen resolution </p>
<p> You can also try and reduce the animations and the screen resolution to FHD instead of QHD. This might reduce the processing and thus lower the overheating. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reduce the animation scale in Developer options: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select “About phone”. </p>
<p> Open Software information and locate the Build number. </p>
<p> Once there, tap on the Build number 7 times and you should be prompted to enter your password in order to enable Developer options. </p>
<p> Open Developer options from the main Settings menu (it should be at the bottom). </p>
<p> Scroll down until you reach Animation options. Set animations to 0.5 and reboot your device. </p>
<p> And this is how to switch to FHD (1080p) from QHD (1440p) display settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Display and open Screen resolution. </p>
<p> Switch to 1080 FHD. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Wipe cache partition or reset to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps helped resolve the Samsung Galaxy S10 overheating, we can only suggest two things before you return your device and ask for the replacement. </p>
<p> Firstly, try wiping the cache partition from the Recovery menu. Here’s how to do it: </p>
<p> Power off your Samsung Galaxy S10. </p>
<p> Simultaneously press and hold the Power button, Volume up, and the Bixby button until the Android logo appears. </p>
<p> After that, you should see the Recovery menu. </p>
<p> Once there, use the volume keys to navigate through the menu and press the Power button to select wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Choose Yes and press the Power button to wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if that doesn’t help, try resetting your device to factory settings and setting it up again. Follow these steps to reset the Samsung Galaxy S10 to factory settings: </p>
<p> Back up everything from your internal storage to an SD card or cloud. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose General management and then Reset. </p>
<p> Select Factory data reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset and then tap Delete all. </p>
<p> If you are still experiencing overheating, make sure to ask for the replacement as your device probably has a flaw causing overheating. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and, if you have any questions, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/safari-cookies-delete-iphone-6" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844262" filename="safari-cookies-delete-iphone-6">
<p> Fix: Safari cookies won’t delete on iPhone 6 </p>
<p> Cookies are the essential part of every browser and, without them, some sites won’t function as intended. On the other hand, without cookies, the sites you’re visiting are unable to track you and therefore, your sensitive data is protected or even interfere with the other sites. Essentially, you need to clear the cookies from time to time. However, that seems to be a problem with certain iPhone 6 users. </p>
<p> Namely, some of the users reported issues with the Safari browser closely related to cookies, especially after 10.3. iOS update. To be more precise, some of them were not able to delete the certain cookies. It seems that the particular cookies are persistent to remain within the Safari browser and they somehow override the deletion standing firm on 0 KB of space. </p>
<p> The ones with the latest version can only wait for next update to address this issue, while others can try out some of the presented workarounds. Hopefully, you can use them to clean all cookies from the app and continue with browsing. </p>
<p> Delete cookies from Advanced tab </p>
<p> Even though there’s a probability that the cookies from some sites won’t get cleaned, there’s a chance that those will be google.com or weather.com which aren’t exactly dangerous. Hopefully, you’ll get rid of some cookies if not all of them. Follow this procedure to clear the browsing data. </p>
<p> Tap Clear History and Website Data. </p>
<p> Additionally, you can select the Edit within the Website Data, and clear the relentless cookies individually. </p>
<p> Update Safari app </p>
<p> Furthermore, you should try and update the Safari app. We can’t be sure is it a bug or a temporary issue, but the latest version may as well resolve your problem instantly. If your auto-update feature isn’t enabled, you can look up for the update manually on the Apple Store in a few easy steps. </p>
<p> Open Apple Store app on your iPhone 6. </p>
<p> Tap Updates. </p>
<p> Tap on Safari if available to update it. </p>
<p> Close the App and try deleting the cookies. </p>
<p> If the problem is persistent, move on to the next steps. </p>
<p> Force restart your iPhone </p>
<p> If the problem is more of an overall issue rather than just the native browser bug, you can try and force restart your iPhone 6 to clear all the conflicts between the app and system. That’s easy to do by following these steps: </p>
<p> Press and hold the Home Button. </p>
<p> While holding the Home Button, press and hold the Sleep button. </p>
<p> Hold for the approximately 15 seconds and the device should restart. </p>
<p> The Apple logo should appear. </p>
<p> Now, navigate to the Settings > Safari > Advanced > Website Data. </p>
<p> Tap Remove All Website Data. </p>
<p> If those pesky cookies are still there, you should move to the next solution on the list. </p>
<p> Update iOS </p>
<p> For the time being, this problem mostly occurs with users that updated to iOS 10.3. Without a doubt, this specific version has some issues and we hope that some of the next versions will resolve this issue. We can expect the next patch (10.3.2) in the upcoming weeks since it’s still in the Beta phase. But, since we aren’t aware of the exact release date, you can from time to time check for the updates. To do so, follow the instructions: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open General. </p>
<p> Tap Software Update. </p>
<p> If there’s an upgrade available, tap Download & Install. </p>
<p> Reset All Settings </p>
<p> Additionally, you may try and reset all settings. Have in mind that this will delete your current setup, preferences and network settings, so make sure to back it up timely before you perform the reset. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to perform the reset of all settings: </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset All Settings. </p>
<p> However, if even this measure was of little or no avail, you may as well perform the factory reset. We’re aware that this is the last resort but sometimes is hard to overcome issues without the clean start. </p>
<p> That should do it. We certainly hope that these workarounds point you in the right direction. Additionally, don’t forget to share your experience or an alternative workaround in the comments below. </p>

<p> This is a new Bug that apple has yet to admit to. You can do everything in their trite and unhelpful responses, and it won’t solve the problem. The only thing that gets rid of them – temporarily – is a factory reset of of your phone. However, they’ll come back. The symptom is that when you go to the Advanced tab in Safari’s Settings, and do “Show All”, then tell Safari to “Delete All”, the screen appears to show them deleted. Now navigate back one screen and re-select “Advanced”: You’ll find some 0k cookies and some 64K cookies. Now… Read more » </p>
<p> Done everything short of reset to factory setting and some website still shows 68.0KB </p>
<p> None of the above works, why would you even post such nonsense. Safari has a major bug on 10.3.1. The only fix for now is reseting your entire device. </p>
<p> This article was intended to address the issue on some of the previous iOS versions, also. But, you’re right, it seems that the ones with the latest iOS version can only wait for the fix or restore factory settings due to a bug. Thank you for your suggestion, we’re going to adapt the article as soon as possible. </p>

<p> As Mark mentioned in the comment above, there’s a bug regarding the latest iOS release. As we see it, you only have 2 options: to either delete everything and start from the scratch or wait for the update where they, allegedly, will offer a solution for this inconvenience. </p>
<p> Wow…the same old generic solution. The only reason you posted this was for easy hits on a hot topic. I’m surprised you didn’t title the article, “TOP 10 THINGS AN IOS USER MUST KNOW TO SAVE THEM FROM 0KB COOKIES! [email protected]@K APPLE SUGGESTION OF THE YEAR!” </p>

<p> I have a iPhone 5s with 10.3.1. I have website data that won’t erase in advanced setting, forced reboot (holding both buttons for 15 seconds), reset network setting, have tried doing so several times, and have tried tried doing so in different orders, and I still hace data that won’t go away. I assumed it was only the porn sites I visited but i have data from the company Raid.com (Johnson and Johnson) and other legitimate copyright businesses. Apple didn’t know techs couldn’t figure it out either. They recommended erase and restore all setting. FYI, I am also having issues… Read more » </p>
<p> As Mark mentioned in the comment above, there’s a bug regarding the latest iOS release. As we see it, you only have 2 options: to either delete everything and start from the scratch or wait for the update where they, allegedly, will offer a solution for this inconvenience. </p>
<p> Wow…the same old generic solution. The only reason you posted this was for easy hits on a hot topic. I’m surprised you didn’t title the article, “TOP 10 THINGS AN IOS USER MUST KNOW TO SAVE THEM FROM 0KB COOKIES! [email protected]@K APPLE SUGGESTION OF THE YEAR!” </p>

<p> None of the above works, why would you even post such nonsense. Safari has a major bug on 10.3.1. The only fix for now is reseting your entire device. </p>
<p> This article was intended to address the issue on some of the previous iOS versions, also. But, you’re right, it seems that the ones with the latest iOS version can only wait for the fix or restore factory settings due to a bug. Thank you for your suggestion, we’re going to adapt the article as soon as possible. </p>

<p> Fix: Safari won’t connect to the internet in iOS </p>
<p> Safari is a pretty stable piece of software. Apple made its default browser to work seamlessly in the well-optimized iOS environment. But some problems may arise here and there. And perhaps the biggest nightmare of every user is when their browser is unable to connect to the internet. </p>
<p> Indeed, reports about Safari connection issues are quite common. Users have been reporting this problem for years now. But luckily, most of these internet connection issues are easily solvable. In fact, it usually takes a simple, general solution, and the internet connection comes back. </p>
<p> In this article, we’re going to focus on issues tightly connected to Safari itself. So, if you’re unable to connect to the internet using any other app, you have a different kind of problem. In that case, try some other solutions like restarting your router, check your WiFi connection, etc. </p>
<p> But if you’re unable to connect to the internet solely through Safari, the following solutions might be helpful. None of these solutions is rocket science, but as unappealing as they might seem, these actually solved the problem for the majority of users. So, at least give it a try. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear the cache and data </p>
<p> The first thing most people do when there’s any app problem is clearing the cache and data of that app. And Safari is no different. So, we’re going to start our troubleshooting process by clearing Safari cache and data. </p>
<p> In case you’re not sure how to do that, just follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Go to the Settings app, navigate to Safari. </p>
<p> Now, scroll to the bottom, and tap the Advanced tab. </p>
<p> Tap Website Data > Remove All Website Data. </p>
<p> That’s about it, your app data is now clear, and hopefully, the problem is resolved now. If you have any issues clearing the site data or cookies (because that’s been a problem for some people, as well), check out this article. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Update the system </p>
<p> It’s quite possible the system itself caused the problem. Most likely after some update. And since Safari receives updates through the system, there’s a good chance the latest patch messed up your browser. </p>
<p> iOS updates are somehow notorious for causing various controversial issues. Although this one isn’t as dangerous as that alleged battery drain incident, it’s still quite annoying. Don’t blame Apple for delivering faulty updates, because every software on every platform is prone to update-caused issues. It’s just how it works. </p>
<p> Anyway, if you find out the problem was indeed caused by the most recent update, there’s pretty much nothing you can do about it. Except waiting for Apple to release a new update. If the problem is wide-spread, the development team will quickly acknowledge it, and release a follow-up patch. </p>
<p> Of course, there could be something you can do, even if the update causes the problem. However, as each update is different, I can’t tell you exactly what to do here. Just search for some more info about that specific update, and maybe you’ll find something useful. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – “Allow” Safari to use the cellular data </p>
<p> iPhone allows you to apply all sorts of restrictions to which kind of content your apps have access to. So, if you’re unable to access the internet through Safari, there’s a good chance your permissions don’t allow you to. </p>
<p> So, the next thing we’re going to try is making sure you’ve obtained all the necessary permissions to access the internet through Safari. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General > Restrictions. </p>
<p> Enter your passcode. </p>
<p> Now, scroll down to the Allowed Content section and then make sure that All is selected next to Websites. </p>
<p> Now you have all the necessary permissions to access websites through Safari. If you’re still unable to connect to the internet, move on to another solution. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reset the Network Settings </p>
<p> Resetting the Network Settings is a general solution, in fact. But it will also reset the Safari settings, in case we’ve missed something. So, it’s a quick solution, to say so. It will definitely save you some time, and effort. </p>
<p> Now you have both network and Safari settings reset. If that didn’t get the job done, there’s the last, most strict solution. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Perform Factory Reset </p>
<p> And finally, the last solution would be to perform the Factory Reset of your system. Doing this has the same purpose as resetting the Network settings, but to a bigger degree, because you’e resetting the whole system. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Don’t forget to backup your data before you confirm. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and start the process. </p>
<p> Later on, you should choose Restore from the iCloud Backup feature. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the problem with the Safari internet connection. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, just write them down in the comments below. </p>
<p> 2 COMMENTS </p>
<p> Thank you! Your first suggestion (clearing the cache) worked for me, which is weird because it’s a new iPhone and I don’t recall ever managing to connect to the internet with Safari on it. As an iPhone beginner and not very techie I’m very grateful. </p>

<p> Thanks for the tips. Unfortunately after latest update my XS will not let me connect with cellular data even if switched on if I don’t also have wifi connection. Opera browser does fine with connecting to internet after I switch off wifi and switch on cellular data in control center. Odd behavior. </p>

<p> Safari not working after latest iOS update </p>
<p> In contrary to some other platforms (Windows Mobile, we look at you!), iOS‘s native browser, Safari, is great since the introduction. Indeed, it’s far from flawless, but it still offers a lot of valuable assets for iOS users, that are well accustomed to great design and intuitive workflow. </p>
<p> Besides some minor bugs that need to be addressed in the future updates, certain users experienced the issue with the crashes after updating to latest iOS version. Even though Apple is thorough with addressing issues, this is a major problem and can disrupt the overall positive image of iPhone’s pre-installed browser. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we prepared some workarounds that should help you resolve the issue at hand. If you’re encountering frequent Safari crashes on your iPhone, make sure to check the list below. </p>
<p> Restart your device </p>
<p> Even though it’s not common, iOS updates are nonetheless changes to system architecture. They can cause some bugs or temporary stutters, or, in this case, affect the built-in system feature which is the Safari web-browser. In this and similar scenarios, we always advise our readers to give restarting a chance. Most of the issues, or at least most of the mild issues, can be resolved by a simple restart of your device. </p>
<p> These instructions should show you how to do it: </p>
<p> Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button. </p>
<p> After it appears, use the slider to turn your device Off. </p>
<p> After the device turns off, use Sleep/Wake button to turn it ON again. </p>
<p> Force quit the app and relaunch it </p>
<p> Another standard workaround that comes in handy once an app starts misbehaving is force quit. It works both for pre-installed system apps like Safari or 3rd-party apps. Once you start the app and things take a wrong turn, there’s the slightest chance that you won’t be able to stop it easily. Luckily, with the force quit, you can close the app completely (from working in the background) and relaunch it again later on. </p>
<p> Double tap the home button. </p>
<p> Swipe up on the Safari app card. </p>
<p> Reopen the app. </p>
<p> Additionally, you can restart your device prior to relaunching the app. </p>
<p> Clear app’s browsing data </p>
<p> As you’re already well aware, Safari stores all the browsing data (depending on settings, it can store it both to local and cloud storage), including browsing history, add-ons, site cache, stored passwords etc. Those can pile up over time and cause the app to malfunction or crash. Especially if you’re not cleaning it frequently. So, basically, what you got to do is to delete all browsing data and look for changes. It just may be the solution to your problem. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Safari. </p>
<p> Tap Clear History and Website Data. </p>
<p> This will delete both internal and iCloud data, so have that in mind. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings </p>
<p> Safari is a built-in app and it heavily depends on system performance, or rather the performance of related features. For the web-browser, it’s essential to have a stable network in order for things to work. Some other 3rd-party browsers are also dependent on connectivity, of course, but only Safari is bound to certain Network settings. For that reason, one of the troubleshooting steps is a factory reset of Network settings. Have in mind that this will clean all your saved passwords and network, so you might need to set them up again manually. </p>
<p> Choose ‘Reset Network Settings’. </p>
<p> Once the device starts, you should be able to continue with the seamless use of the iOS browser. </p>
<p> Disable Safari Suggestions </p>
<p> The Safari Suggestions feature is a smart and intuitive solution for content previews while searching for something in the Search Bar. It’s amazingly designed, but not flawless. Many users are not ready to give up on those, solely because of the overall usefulness of Safari Suggestions. However, this feature can heavily impact the performance since they are somewhat known for slow downs and similar issues. </p>
<p> So, it might be a good idea to disable them. At least to determine are they behind the bug or not. If you’re not sure how to do it, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Open Safari. </p>
<p> Disable Search Engine Suggestions. </p>
<p> Disable Safari Suggestions. </p>
<p> Reset to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if nothing of the previous steps proved as a valid solution, you might need to turn to a factory reset and restore. By restoring your device to factory values, you should be able to resolve the problem at hand. Additionally, you can choose to downgrade to previous iOS version, but that might take you too much time, and, in the worst case scenario, can temporary damage your phone. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Start iTunes and choose Summary. </p>
<p> Remember to backup your iPhone data. </p>
<p> Select Restore iPhone. </p>
<p> That should do it. If you’ve had additional issues, make sure to share them with us in the comments section below. We’ll be glad to assist you. Thank you for reading and have a nice day. </p>

<p> Samsung A10 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Even though sales were hardly bad, Samsung wasn’t known for exactly amazing lower mid-range and low-end devices until 2019. That’s when they introduced a new Galaxy A series, making Samsung Galaxy A10 one of the most wanted devices for undemanding users out there. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy A10 brings nothing spectacular but its low price point and all elementary features, make for an amazing entry device. Now, if you purchased this device and run into certain issues with it, we made a list of common Samsung Galaxy A10 issues below. Of course, we offered the most applicable solutions, as well. </p>
<p> 1. Battery draining fast </p>
<p> The 3400 mAh battery should be good enough to take you through the day, considering the A10 has a moderately-sized display (by today’s bigger-is-better standards, at least) and a power-preserving Exynos chipset. </p>
<p> And that seems to be the case for the majority of users, although some are not exactly satisfied with the battery longevity on the Samsung Galaxy A10. It seems that the battery depletes quickly and a mediocre charging speed doesn’t help. </p>
<p> We have a few tips for you regarding extending battery life. Here’s what you can do: </p>
<p> Disable background apps. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi, Location Services, and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Ensure that the network signal is strong. If the device is constantly searching for network coverage, it will deplete the battery quickly. </p>
<p> Disable Auto-brightness and set the brightness manually. </p>
<p> 2. The device is slow </p>
<p> Don’t get us wrong, but this is completely expected if you use the 2 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy A10. The Exynos 7884 combined with 2 GB of RAM is just not enough for certain modern operations one could do today, especially gaming. We are, again, looking at a budget device so it would be unfair to expect miracles for that price point. </p>
<p> On the other hand, the UI is quite well optimized and animations won’t result in stutters all that often. Nonetheless, if you are experiencing any issues with the slow loading, system UI crashes, etc. — here are a few ways to reduce the load on this budget device: </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Try booting into Safe Mode and look for improvements. If the device performs better, continue with the steps. </p>
<p> Lower the Animation scale in Developer options from 1 to 0.5. </p>
<p> Limit the number of background apps in Developer options. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 3. Notifications not coming through </p>
<p> We already wrote about Gmail Notification issues plaguing a variety of Android devices, especially Samsung’s Note and Galaxy series. This seems to be an issue on the Samsung Galaxy A10 as well, as many users are not getting notifications, especially on the Lock Screen. </p>
<p> Everything seemingly worked just before an update which broke the way notifications are distributed. With that in mind, here are some steps you can take to resolve notification issues on your Samsung Galaxy A10: </p>
<p> Disable the Do not disturb mode. </p>
<p> Open Settings > Notifications and then tap Status bar. Toggle ON the “Show notification icons” option. </p>
<p> In Settings > Notifications, tap See all under the Recently sent. Enable all notifications for individual apps. Additionally, tap on the app that’s missing notifications and then enable Sound and pop-up under various categories. </p>
<p> Update your device. </p>
<p> 4. Netflix black screen </p>
<p> Using streaming services like Netflix while on the move is a standard these days. Netflix for Android is probably the most used streaming service for smartphones, offering offline content that comes in numbers. However, some A10 users are unable to start Netflix on their device as it results in the black screen. </p>
<p> If you are stuck with this after multiple tries, we encourage you to try and resolve the problem with these steps: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Netflix and clear cache and data from the app. Reboot your phone and give it another go. </p>
<p> Install Netflix APK from, here. Uninstall the current version from your device, navigate to the link and allow installation from the unknown sources. Log in with your credentials and check for improvements. </p>
<p> 5. Touchscreen issues </p>
<p> The issues with the screen sensibility are not as common, and the ghost touch issues are even less prominent on Samsung devices. However, it seems that this IPS LCD-powered budget handset does have minor issues. Of course, for some users. Others are not affected by it at all. </p>
<p> In case your A10 has any touchscreen issues, we suggest trying steps we listed below: </p>
<p> Remove the screen protector. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and run it in the Safe Mode. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> If the problem persists, make sure to take the device for a repair as the problem is most definitely hardware-related. </p>
<p> 6. Samsung Pay not working </p>
<p> Samsung Pay won’t work on this device, sadly. In order for the Samsung Pay feature to work, a handset requires NFC (Near Field Communication) which isn’t available on the Samsung Galaxy A10. </p>
<p> There’s no alternative for missing hardware in this scenario, so we don’t recommend getting this device in the first place (or replacing it, if possible) if you heavily rely on Samsung Pay. </p>
<p> 7. Can’t install apps from the Play Store </p>
<p> One of noted issues on Samsung Galaxy A10 that some users run into concerns the Play Store. Namely, they were unable to update and/or install apps from the Google Play Store after multiple tries. </p>
<p> There’s a variety of reasons why this might occur, and we wrote in detail about it in this article. Check it out and, hopefully, some of the steps we listed will help you address the problem at hand. </p>
<p> 8. Not receiving calls from certain numbers </p>
<p> This, among many other distinctive reports, is most certainly an individual problem. If you can’t receive calls from a certain number, we encourage you to check your Blocklist and ensure that that the contact is not, indeed, blocked. </p>
<p> Alternatively, make sure that your SIM card is properly placed in the SIM tray. Sometimes, the APN might also be a problem, so make sure to reset your network settings. Learn how to do so at the bottom of this article. </p>
<p> 9. Troubleshooting steps for Samsung Galaxy A10 </p>
<p> Enable Developer options </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open About phone. </p>
<p> Then tap on the Build number 7 times until the prompt informs you that the Developer options are unlocked. You might need to enter your PIN or Password. </p>
<p> The Developer options should appear in the main Settings menu. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button until the Power menu appears. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Power Off icon until you see the Safe Mode prompt. </p>
<p> Tap again to restart your device into the Safe Mode. </p>
<p> To exit the Safe Mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> Back up your data from the internal storage (photos can be saved to Google Photos, other media can be saved to an external storage or a PC). </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > General management > Reset. </p>
<p> Select Factory data reset. </p>
<p> Follow instructions to reset your device to factory values. </p>
<p> That should do it. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to post your questions or report additional Samsung Galaxy A10 issues in the comments section below. Our readers or we might be able to help you resolve them. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy A51 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung took its midrange game to a completely new level with the revamped A series. The update for their best-selling device, the Samsung Galaxy A50, was introduced not long after. The Samsung Galaxy A51 brings great AMOLED experience and overall reliability to users who don’t want to break the bank. Additionally, Samsung promised that this device, unlike the A50, will get 3 major OS updates, which is great. </p>
<p> However, we can’t turn our heads away from the numerous emerging issues that bother many Samsung Galaxy A51 users. For that reason, we made certain to bring all major issues to the table along with the applicable solutions. Check them out below. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> 1. Battery draining fast </p>
<p> Since the device was introduced and first purchases were made, many users reported heavy battery drainage on the Samsung Galaxy A51. </p>
<p> Even though the battery capacity paired with the Super AMOLED display should provide a significant Screen-on Time, the battery drains a lot, even when idle. The probable reason for this is the somewhat outdated Exynos 9611 (10nm). </p>
<p> With that in mind, we can suggest a few things to improve battery life on your Samsung Galaxy A51. At least, to some extent. Follow these steps to reduce battery drainage and extend the Screen-on Time: </p>
<p> Disable background apps. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi, Location Services, and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Ensure that the network signal is strong. If the device is constantly searching for network coverage, it will deplete the battery quickly. </p>
<p> Disable Auto-brightness and set the brightness manually. </p>
<p> 2. Slow Wi-Fi </p>
<p> There are many reports coming from the Samsung Galaxy A51 users concerning Wi-Fi stability and speed on 2.4 GHz networks. Many of them tested several networks with different devices and got much better results than with Samsung’s mid-ranger. </p>
<p> We can’t say with certainty what’s exactly causing this problem or whether it’s a software or hardware issue. Some suspect Bluetooth is interfering with Wi-Fi. On the other hand, there are some troubleshooting steps you can try. Here’s what you can do: </p>
<p> Enable Airplane mode and disable it. </p>
<p> Restart your phone and router. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> 3. 4G issues </p>
<p> Similar to the aforementioned Wi-Fi issues, 4G mobile data issues are also present for some users. However, this one is definitely a software issue. Namely, users are unable to toggle On the mobile data from the notification bar. They have to either reboot their device or navigate to Settings and enable it from there. </p>
<p> In order to resolve this, we strongly suggest updating your device. Alternatively, you can back up your data and go for the factory reset. The latter option is the last resort as we all know how tedious can be setting up everything from a scratch. </p>
<p> 4. The Galaxy A51 won’t update </p>
<p> Samsung recently promised 3 years of major updates to 10+ devices. Including the Galaxy A51. That can be a life-changer, especially considering the bad rap Samsung had with its mid-range lineups in the past. However, before the Samsung Galaxy A51 sees Android 11 or Android 12, it needs to be able to install updates in the first place. </p>
<p> Some users reported update issues, as the device won’t start the reboot-flash-boot sequence on the stock ROM. If this bothers you, we recommend ensuring that you have enough storage space firstly. </p>
<p> After that, navigate to the Updater app and clear its cache and data. If that doesn’t help and the device still won’t update, boot into recovery and wipe the cache partition clean. </p>
<p> 5. Brightness issues </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy A51, like basically all Samsung handsets, has quite a remarkable Super AMOLED with great viewing angles and exquisite brightness reaching 565 nits outdoors while the Adaptive brightness is enabled. However, some users have encountered a bug with brightness. </p>
<p> Namely, it seems that the display dims on its own even with the adaptive brightness setting is disabled. We recommend restarting your device. In case that doesn’t help, try running the Test code in the dialer. The code is *#0*#. You can test your display there for possible factory errors. </p>
<p> In case you are still running into this system bug, we suggest resetting your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6. Overheating </p>
<p> This one issue is quite frequently reported on various forums. Exynos chips that widely used by Samsung are known to be prone to overheat. Especially if you are gaming for an extended period of time, have poor network coverage, or use the device while it’s charging. </p>
<p> Keeping your device up-to-date firmware-wise should help but, just to get in a clear, make sure to remove the protective casing while charging. Also, we strongly suggest using the included charger solely. </p>
<p> 7. Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> Having a stable Bluetooth connection is something many users are expecting in this day and age, considering that the wireless headphones (earbuds) are getting prominent. Sadly, some users are reporting scratchy sound. For some, Bluetooth is frequently disconnecting. </p>
<p> In case you are experiencing any Bluetooth issues, make sure to try all these steps in order to resolve the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Unpair and pair your handset again with the device. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth A2DP Hardware Offload in Developer Options. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 8. UI freezing and animation lags </p>
<p> Can the optimized software compensate for the subpar chipset? Sometimes, the answer is yes (Google Pixel 3a is a good example), but that isn’t the case for many Samsung devices. Exynos 9611 paired with 4/6 GB of RAM should be good enough but that’s just not the case for some. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy A51 users report a lot of issues with OneUI which freezes while transition animations are lagging, as well. We have a few suggestions that should help you, if not to resolve, then to at least mitigate problems lags. </p>
<p> Here’s what you should do if UI is freezing and animations are lagging on the Samsung Galaxy A51: </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Try booting into Safe Mode and look for improvements. If the device performs better, continue with the steps. </p>
<p> Lower the Animation scale in Developer options from 1 to 0.5 or disable them altogether. </p>
<p> Limit the number of background apps in Developer options. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 9. VPN issues on the Samsung Galaxy A51 </p>
<p> These days, many users rely on VPNs for various reasons. Whether due to privacy concerns or removing geo-restrictions, it is a must for many users. Many OEMs (including Samsung) went as far as to give VPN a separate section in the Settings menu, with options like Always-on VPN to ensure that the VPN will work in the background. </p>
<p> However, some Samsung Galaxy A51 users have had a hard time connecting to a VPN. In case you are among the affected users, we can recommend a few things. Firstly, make sure that the VPN app of your choice has the necessary permission. Additionally, try reinstalling the app and forgetting VPN and re-adding it again. </p>
<p> 10. Spontaneous reboots on the Samsung Galaxy A51 </p>
<p> This is a serious one. More than a few Samsung Galaxy A51 users reported spontaneous reboots and there was no apparent reason why. Now, chances are that there’s some kind of system corruption at hand, although hardware failure is a more probable scenario. </p>
<p> You can try wiping the cache partition or booting into safe mode in order to troubleshoot, however, the best thing to do is to go for a factory reset. The problem seemingly started appearing after an OTA update and so factory reset should be a good next step. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, if the issue continues to bother you despite a clean-slate start, we suggest contacting your carrier or retailer. Asking for a replacement is an obvious step. </p>
<p> 11. Camera won’t focus, crashes, and Macro mode issues </p>
<p> The quad-camera setup (48 MP wide, 12 MP ultrawide, Macro, and Depth sensor) on the Samsung Galaxy A51 should bring at least average photography experience. However, we learned so many times in recent times that it’s not all about hardware when it comes to smartphone cameras. </p>
<p> The camera software on the Samsung Galaxy A51 is far from being optimized. User reports talk about focus issues, Camera app crashes, Macro mode being an unreliable gimmick instead of a useful lense utilization, color smudges in low-light conditions, HDR issues, sound in recordings being muffled, and more. </p>
<p> We can suggest a few steps in order to try and address the majority of Camera issues on the Samsung Galaxy A51: </p>
<p> Clear data and cache from the Camera app in Settings > Apps. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Check the in-app settings and ensure that HDR is disabled if you dislike it. </p>
<p> Update your firmware. </p>
<p> 12. Low in-call volume and system sound </p>
<p> A good on-device speaker is a good thing to have but there are many factors when it comes to reproduction. Some users are unable to get the device to play sounds at all when streaming or watching clips on YouTube. Others experience stutters which probably occur due to processor lags (we can’t be sure about that, though). </p>
<p> Additionally, the low in-call volume is another problem reported by numerous users. For the time being, your best bet to address these issues is to update your device to the latest firmware version and hope for the best. Alternatively, you can give the factory reset a go. </p>
<p> 13. The phone is not charging above 75% </p>
<p> This problem is scarcely reported but we read a few comments explaining that the battery measuring started going crazy for some users. Now, there’s no need to worry as this, most likely, isn’t a hardware issue. </p>
<p> You can try wiping the cache partition but it’s advisable to calibrate your battery. That can be done by following the steps we presented in this dedicated article. </p>
<p> 14. Troubleshooting steps for Samsung Galaxy A51 </p>
<p> Enable Developer options </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open About phone. </p>
<p> Then tap on the Build number 7 times until the prompt informs you that the Developer options are unlocked. You might need to enter your PIN or Password. </p>
<p> The Developer options should appear in the main Settings menu. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button until the Power menu appears. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Power Off icon until you see the Safe Mode prompt. </p>
<p> Tap again to restart your device into the Safe Mode. </p>
<p> To exit the Safe Mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> Back up your data from the internal storage (photos can be saved to Google Photos, other media can be saved to an external storage or a PC). </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > General management > Reset. </p>
<p> Select Factory data reset. </p>
<p> Follow instructions to reset your device to factory values. </p>
<p> And, with that sorted out, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and make sure to tell us about additional issues or alternative solutions for the ones presented in the comments section below. We always look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy A71 issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Samsung is at the top of the smartphone market for a reason. Besides their flagship devices, they went for an overhaul in the mid-range and budget departments last year, by introducing a revamped A series. Later in 2019, they expanded the formation with the Samsung Galaxy A51 and A71. In all accounts, the Samsung Galaxy A71 is one of the most competitive devices in the mid-range segment to date. </p>
<p> There are good and there are great devices but there’s no device without any issues. For all Samsung Galaxy A71 users out there, we decided to roam the interweb and check for reports, complaints, and straight-up rants concerning this device. The issues along with solutions can be found below. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Battery draining </p>
<p> Based on many test ratings, the Samsung Galaxy A71 is at the top of the endurance list in its category. Despite it packs a large display, the 4500 mAh battery and quite a power-efficient Snapdragon 730 (Exynos 980 on the 5G variation) should bring great Screen-on Time. </p>
<p> Sadly, that’s not the case for many users who reported battery drains and underwhelming endurance. For some, the device drains the battery even in the idle mode, when the screen is off for some time. Others have strange battery percentage spikes which lead us to believe that the battery isn’t calibrated. </p>
<p> We have a standard list of tweaks you can follow to prolong the battery life. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Disable background apps. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi, Location Services, and Mobile Data overnight. </p>
<p> Ensure that the network signal is strong. If the device is constantly searching for network coverage, it will deplete the battery quickly. </p>
<p> Disable Auto-brightness and set the brightness manually. </p>
<p> You can learn how to calibrate the battery in this dedicated article. </p>
<p> 2. Apps crashing on the Samsung Galaxy A71 </p>
<p> This is a major problem for some users and, based on reports, the built-in SMS app is mostly the one crashing. Apparently, this started occurring after a system update. Firstly, you’ll need to ensure that your device is up to date. Secondly, navigating to Settings > Apps > Messages and clear the data from the app. </p>
<p> If clearing the data does nothing and crashes are reoccurring, we suggest wiping the cache partition. In the end, you can also go for the factory reset or use a third-party app to receive and send SMS messages until Samsung fixes the issue. </p>
<p> 3. Headphone jack issues </p>
<p> Unlike many devices in this pricing segment, Samsung decided to keep the headphone jack on the Samsung Galaxy A71. However, some users are unable to use their headphones for no apparent reason. </p>
<p> All and every headphone with a 3.5 mm jack should work on the device. If that’s not the case for you, make sure to inspect the state of the headphone or buds. If the issue persists, the hardware is likely the problem so we recommend asking for the replacement. </p>
<p> 4. Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues on recent Samsung devices are widely acknowledged, even by Samsung, but they are not fixed for everyone. Users are still experiencing unstable pairing and frequent disconnections. Especially when playing wireless audio on headphones, buds, or in-car systems. </p>
<p> We have a few recommendations to try in order to fix or improve the Bluetooth connectivity on your Samsung Galaxy A71. Follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Unpair and pair your handset again with the device. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth A2DP Hardware Offload in Developer Options. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 5. Mobile data issues on the Samsung Galaxy A71 </p>
<p> As seen on multiple user forums, connectivity problems keep piling on Samsung mid-range devices. Some users have had a hard time with network signal coverage while others simply can get mobile data to work consistently. Seemingly, the device disconnects once the screen is off. </p>
<p> We can’t say with certainty why this problem occurs but here are some tricks you can try in order to fix it: </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Check the SIM card placement. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Also, don’t forget that the carrier can have a part in this so make sure to contact your carrier support if the issue persists. </p>
<p> 6. Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> As we said in the previous paragraph, the issues with connectivity are quite common on the Samsung Galaxy A71. And the worst one concerns Wi-Fi connectivity that falls short of expectations considering this is, all-around, a great device. </p>
<p> Constant disconnections (especially with the screen off), slow Wi-Fi connection, or instances when the device won’t connect at all. With that in mind, we read about some updates pushed by Samsung that addressed the problem. On the other hand, some reports are quite recent which makes us believe that Wi-Fi still needs some tweaking done on this device. </p>
<p> In the meanwhile, try these steps in order to, if not fix, at least mitigate the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Enable Airplane mode and disable it. </p>
<p> Forget the network and re-connect. </p>
<p> Restart your phone and router. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 7. Can’t install Samsung Pay </p>
<p> If you are unable to install the Samsung Pay app on your device, chances are that the service isn’t available in your region. The app usually comes pre-installed in supported regions. </p>
<p> You can try to sideload the APK or use a VPN but we don’t recommend the former as it is risky and can lead to data theft. On the other hand, if you are certain that Samsung Pay is indeed supported in your region, make sure to update your device and check Samsung’s Store. </p>
<p> 8. Poor facial recognition </p>
<p> Like many other OEMs, besides the on-screen optical fingerprint, the Samsung A71 offers face recognition as an alternative biometric authentication. Wake the screen, look at it, and the device should unlock without in no time. However, some users have had a hard time utilizing this option, as the device can’t recognize them, even after numerous tries. </p>
<p> What we suggest is deleting your face data and enrolling it again. Make sure to add glasses if you are wearing them. Also, keep the distance from the screen and make sure that you are in a well-light area. </p>
<p> 9. No system sound or in-call sound </p>
<p> In comparison to issues with the headphones jack, the complete or partial absence of system sounds is definitely a bigger problem. Namely, some user reports state that there’s no notification sound while others have problems with charging sound. </p>
<p> Make sure to navigate to Settings > Apps and check Notification settings for each app that doesn’t come with sound. Alternatively, if you are having issues with the in-call sound, make sure to clear the mic and restart the device. If that doesn’t help, consider resetting your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 10. The camera freezing and video issues </p>
<p> We can’t argue about the multi-lens camera setup on the Samsung Galaxy A71, but the software part seems to be quite underwhelming for some users. It seems that the Camera app freezes when switching lenses and modes, it takes a lot of time to capture a photo when the HDR is enabled, etc. </p>
<p> To add insult to injury, video mode won’t work for many users, as well. If you are experiencing any issues with the Camera app, make sure to check the steps we listed below: </p>
<p> Clear data and cache from the Camera app in Settings > Apps. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Check the in-app settings and ensure that HDR is disabled if you dislike it. </p>
<p> Update your firmware. </p>
<p> 11. Random shutdowns after update </p>
<p> Random shutdowns, bootloops, or system crashes are something no one wants to see. However, based on reports, that’s exactly what some users experienced on the Samsung Galaxy A71 as soon as they updated the device. </p>
<p> We can only suggest wiping the cache partition and, if that fails, resetting your device to factory settings. Just in case the issue persists, make sure to send a ticket to your carrier or retailer. </p>
<p> 12. Display multitouch and black spot issues </p>
<p> Besides possible burn-in issues, Super AMOLED displays rarely have anything else going against them. However, some Samsung Galaxy A71 users reported multitouch issues, as the screen won’t respond to more inputs than 2. </p>
<p> Additionally, in certain conditions (both Dark Mode and Night Light modes enabled while brightness is low), some users noticed black spots in the background. </p>
<p> Our recommended solution for the multitouch issues is testing first (insert the *#0*# code in the Dialer) and then resetting the device if the issue persists. It doesn’t mean that this is a system-wide problem. Some third-party apps might be affected only. </p>
<p> For the black spots in the background, we can only recommend replacing the device. This is a panel issue and it’s hardly anything you can do except to try and ignore it (if it doesn’t bother you) or take it for the repair or replacement. </p>
<p> 13. Gyroscope and proximity sensor issues </p>
<p> Some users have had a hard time with both gyroscope and magnetic sensors. Now, judging by reports, this is probably a software optimization issue and, by updating your device, you should be able to resolve it. You can also access the *#0*# code in the Dialer (Phone app) and try and calibrate both sensors. </p>
<p> The same goes for the proximity sensor that is hit or miss sometimes. It won’t turn off the screen during calls for some users occasionally. Try restarting your device, make sure to keep it up to date and, if sensor issues persist, backing up everything, and resetting the device isn’t the worse idea. </p>
<p> 14. The Samsung Galaxy A71 is overheating </p>
<p> Another problem that occasionally bothers Samsung Galaxy A71 users. It seems that the device is getting quite hot when charging and during extensive gaming sessions. Now, there might be some problem with the kernel on your firmware, so make sure to report the problem to Samsung support. </p>
<p> On the other hand, you can reduce overheating by removing the protective casing while charging or playing demanding games. Also, we don’t recommend using your device while fast charging. </p>
<p> 15. Troubleshooting steps for the Samsung Galaxy A71 </p>
<p> Enable Developer options </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open About phone. </p>
<p> Then tap on the Build number 7 times until the prompt informs you that the Developer options are unlocked. You might need to enter your PIN or Password. </p>
<p> The Developer options should appear in the main Settings menu. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button until the Power menu appears. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the Power Off icon until you see the Safe Mode prompt. </p>
<p> Tap again to restart your device into the Safe Mode. </p>
<p> To exit the Safe Mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings </p>
<p> Back up your data from the internal storage (photos can be saved to Google Photos, other media can be saved to an external storage or a PC). </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > General management > Reset. </p>
<p> Select Factory data reset. </p>
<p> Follow instructions to reset your device to factory values. </p>
<p> And, on that note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to tell us about issues we forgot or ask in detail about the ones we put on our list. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy J3 most common issues and how to resolve them </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy J3 is more than a viable option in the lower low-budget category. If you’re not exceptionally demanding user and a loyal fan of Samsung handsets, J3 is well-suited for the job. However, for this and the majority of handsets, there are always issues that need to be addressed. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we prepared a list of most frequently reported problems provided by J3 users. Of course, we provided you with the proper troubleshooting steps, so make sure to check for your individual problem. We hope that you’ll find the remedy for your ache in the list below. </p>
<p> Battery issues </p>
<p> First, the main reason why people seem to deem the overall usability of this handset lackluster is the battery. The battery on J3 isn’t bad per se, and it certainly won the battle with the competition in 2016. Nonetheless, it’s the software within the device that drains the battery. So, even though the 2600 mAh battery is well-performing, there are still ways to improve the battery life and reduce the consumption. For that purpose, we enlisted some of those workarounds below: </p>
<p> Disable background apps. You can either do it manually within Settings > Application manager or by using the Smart Manager (Device Maintainance). Navigate to Settings > Device Maintainance > Unmonitored apps, and clear apps that are using the battery extensively while working in the background. </p>
<p> Use Battery Power Saving mode. Tap Settings > Device Maintainance > Battery and use one of two battery saving modes. </p>
<p> Disable GPS. You can either disable GPS permanently until an app acquires it or reduce the accuracy of the location service by changing location method to Phone only. Tap Settings > Connections > Enable Location > Location method, and switch to Phone only. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> In addition, make sure to uninstall the redundant and unused apps that are hogging on your device resources. We hope that with those, you’ll be able to extend your battery’s life. </p>
<p> Overheating issues </p>
<p> Overheating isn’t exactly a common problem, but it does affect certain users. And once it occurs, it’s likely to make your overall experience with the J3 quite hard to cope with. Moreover, if the phone is overheating over extended periods, you may encounter more than lags and stutters. Namely, in the worst case scenario, you can expect hardware failure. Obviously, it’s essential to address the overheating issue before it’s too late. </p>
<p> There are various reasons for this occurrence, and we advise you to check the following steps in order to prevent them: </p>
<p> Don’t use your phone while charging. </p>
<p> Check the resource hogging apps in the background. </p>
<p> Make sure that your battery isn’t faulty. </p>
<p> Remove the casing. </p>
<p> Don’t expose your handset to heat sources over an extended period of times. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Connectivity issues are generally not unusual for a multitude of Android handsets. Some of them suffer from the lackluster signal, while others are known for connection crashes. Either way, it’s hard to use your device as intended without the proper Wi-Fi connection. Almost impossible. Samsung Galaxy J3 isn’t exactly known for Wi-Fi issues, but some isolated cases are still enough for us to address the issue. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to follow the instructions below in order to troubleshoot Wi-Fi issues on your J3: </p>
<p> Forget Network and connect again. </p>
<p> Press and hold on Wi-Fi icon in the Notification panel to open Wi-Fi settings. </p>
<p> Use 5 GHz instead of 2.4 GHz and vice versa. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Turn off the device. Make sure that your battery is not critically low. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Up key + Home key + Power button. </p>
<p> Once the logo appears on the screen, release the Power button while holding the Volume Up key + Home key. </p>
<p> Wait for the Android logo to appear and release all buttons. </p>
<p> Use the Volume Down key to find and highlight the ‘wipe cache partition’ option. </p>
<p> Use the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Now, scroll down with the Volume Down key and highlight ”Yes”. </p>
<p> Mobile data issues </p>
<p> As same as with the Wi-Fi, some users experienced issues with the Mobile Data. Some of them weren’t able to use the 3G/4G as intended due to SIM card issues, while others encountered issues with unexpected signal drops and similar irregularities. Most of the time, the issue is closely related to an inappropriate position of the SIM card. Cellular signal drops are the best way to find out is your SIM card properly inserted in the SIM tray. </p>
<p> On the other hand, there are also some software issues that need to be examined, since the problem isn’t exclusively connected to the SIM card. Follow the instructions below to troubleshoot the mobile data issues on your Samsung Galaxy J3: </p>
<p> Reset your device. </p>
<p> Switch Network type. Settings>More>Cellular Networks>Preffered Network type. Select LTE and save settings. </p>
<p> TurnAirplane mode ON and then OFF. </p>
<p> Reset APN settings. Go to Settings > Connections> Mobile Networks > Tap Access Point Names > More > Reset to default. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Navigate to Settings > Backup & reset > Network settings reset>Reset Settings. </p>
<p> Remove SIM card and put it back again. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth. </p>
<p> With that, you should be able to use the mobile data just like before. </p>
<p> SD card issues </p>
<p> SD card is of utmost importance if you want to store more multimedia since the device is limited to 16 GB of internal storage. However, users reported issues with SD cards, too. Namely, some of them weren’t able to transfer the data from internal storage to SD. Other – well – their J3 wouldn’t even recognize the SD card or suddenly unmounts it. For that purpose, we advise you to follow the steps below, since there are multiple ways to address this issue. </p>
<p> Power Off your device and remove SD card from the slot. Clean the slot with the compressed air and re-insert the SD card. </p>
<p> Backup your SD card on your PC and format it. Make sure to format or reformat the SD card and copy the backed-up content again. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Unexpected shutdown issues </p>
<p> If we take into consideration all enlisted issues of J3, this is probably the most intimidating one. Some users pointed out the major issue with regard to sudden restarts or even shutdowns. There are few reasons for this occurrence and we’re presenting them below: </p>
<p> The phone is overheating. </p>
<p> Custom ROM causes issues with the hardware. </p>
<p> Hardware failure. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we advise you to look at presented solutions for overheating issue and flash your device again. In addition, you can try to boot into the safe mode and examine the behavior. If the phone is working as intended, make sure to delete all lately installed apps. In contrary, if the device is still failing, it’s likely that we’re looking at hardware malfunction. So make sure to take your Samsung Galaxy J3 for repairs. </p>
<p> SIM card issues </p>
<p> You would imagine that this is a problem similar to the one with the SD card. Symptoms are obviously different, but the reason is, most of the time, inappropriate placement. On the other hand, with the latest updates, users with SIM card issues (sudden loss of network signal, mobile data loss, and ”Please insert SIM card” error) are rightfully suspecting the software involvement, as well. For that purpose, we prepared a list of possible solutions you should take into consideration: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Reinsert SIM card and/or switch SIM 1 and SIM 2 positions if you’re using dual-SIM option. </p>
<p> Try your SIM card in another handset to make sure it’s working. </p>
<p> Select ”3G only”. Navigate to Settings > Connections > Mobile Networks > Network Mode, and choose ”3G only” from the dropdown list. </p>
<p> Select proper access point. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth temporarily. </p>
<p> Boot in the safe mode and look for changes in the signal behavior. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> In the plethora of reported issues, it wouldn’t be fair to skip on Bluetooth issues. Bluetooth-related issues that are reported, mostly refer to failed pairing or unstable connection with the paired device. This mostly occurs in a pairing J3 with the car board. Or lack of it, to be exact. Luckily, if we exclude the hardware failure of the Bluetooth radio, there are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this problem. </p>
<p> Disable other network services while using Bluetooth (Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G). </p>
<p> ”Forget” device and try to pair again. </p>
<p> Wipe partition cache (process explained above). </p>
<p> That should do it. If you have alternative issues or solutions for the problems we presented above, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. We’ll be glad to help you. Thanks for reading and have a good day. </p>

<p> The screen light won’t come on anymore on my phone. Of course, when the phone is off, the screen is completely black and when I turn it on, the screen becomes lit just slightly, as it should. But when I attempt to use the phone, the dim light doesn’t change to bright as it used to. Has anyone else had this problem? </p>

<p> I’ve had my Samsung Galaxy J3 phone for a year or so with no problems until now. The problem started yesterday but is much worse today. Yesterday, the screen would go dark shortly after I would start to read or write an email or message. But I was able to complete the task each time. However, today, the screen goes dark almost immediately after I swipe to open the screen and I cannot get the screen to light up except for a brief second. So essentially I cannot do anything with the phone today. Anyone have any experience with an… Read more » </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy S10 issues: Fingerprint scanner, Battery drain, and more </p>
<p> So, you got yourself the brand new Samsung Galaxy S10? Congratulations, you now own the best and perhaps most complete smartphone to date! It’s amazing what this device has to offer. World-class performance, great camera, beautiful design, you name it. But all of that comes with a hefty price. </p>
<p> And when you pay that much for a phone, you expect it to fly, literally. Unfortunately, the reality is different, and even a beast like the S10 can stutter sometimes. I know even the smallest lag or flaw can completely ruin the vibe of owning this technological masterpiece, but you have to deal with it, nevertheless. </p>
<p> To make things easier for you, I was on the hunt for the reported Galaxy S10 issues. So, if you’re affected by any of the following problems, I hope you’ll find the right solution here. </p>
<p> 1. Fingerprint scanner issues </p>
<p> The revolutionary ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is one of this phone’s highlight features. On paper, it should work flawlessly, but it’s still the first generation. And the first generation of just about anything is not exactly the most polished one. </p>
<p> But despite being the pioneer of the ultrasonic fingerprint technology, the S10’s fingerprint reader holds up well. However, there are still some delays in responsiveness, which annoy users who encounter them. </p>
<p> If you’ve recently experienced any issues with the fingerprint scanner, the solution is rather simple. All you need to do is to remove the screen protector, and the fingerprint scanner should become much more responsible. </p>
<p> I’m not a fan of screen protectors, so removing it wouldn’t bother me at all. If you’re like me, the problem’s solved. On the other hand, if you prefer screen protectors, try a third-party option. </p>
<p> 2. Camera issues/Blurry photos </p>
<p> The general opinion about the S10’s camera is mainly positive. It sits at the top of the pyramid of today’s smartphone cameras, although it’s still not the best one, especially with the Huawei P30 Pro in the market now. But all in all, the Galaxy S10 delivers a camera you would expect to find in such a premium device. </p>
<p> However, there are complaints from users unsatisfied with the end result. Namely, people have been reporting for some time now that pictures often turn blurry, as the phone fails to focus on the right point. </p>
<p> As the Galaxy S10 boasts a very advanced camera (and the software that makes it work), there are numerous settings that can drastically improve the quality of pictures, but also make them worse. Because of that, it’s recommended to switch off some settings, to get better results. The particular settings I’m talking about are Flaw Detection and Scene Optimizer. So, go to your camera’s settings, and disable these two options. Hopefully, you’ll be able to capture sharper images. </p>
<p> Another way of improving the quality of photos on your Samsung Galaxy S10 is by using a Google Camera port for the S10. Good folks from the XDA Developers were quick enough to develop this port, and it’s now available for free and doesn’t require the root access! Because, you know Google’s an absolute champion in developing image-processing software, and you can take the full advantage of that. </p>
<p> Note: I’ll write the full guide on how to use the Google Camera port on the Galaxy S10 as soon as possible, so stay tuned. </p>
<p> 3. Black and white screen </p>
<p> I’ve found none serious display problems. Which was more or less expected, since Samsung manufactures the industry-best displays. However, there’s one individual case, which may or may not bother anyone else. </p>
<p> Namely, one user reported that his screen turns black and white upon unlocking. This is caused by the Wind Down feature of Google’s Digital Wellbeing app. So, the obvious solution is to turn off this feature inside the Digital Wellbeing app, and the screen should go back to normal. </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy S10 is the first non-Google device that ships with the Digital Wellbeing app, so this feature could cause the screen issues without you even knowing and paying attention to it. </p>
<p> 4. Yellow screen </p>
<p> A few users reported that the screen looks yellowish. Now, this could be because of the Blue Light Filter option, which, as its name says, disables the blue light to make the screen more pleasant to look at. </p>
<p> This can be easily resolved by disabling the Blue Light Filter, and setting the screen to Natural in the display options. </p>
<p> I should also mention that Samsung intentionally made the S10’s screen “less blue”. So, even if the display is in the Natural mode, it will appear more yellow compared to previous Galaxy S devices. </p>
<p> 5. Can’t turn off Blue Light filter </p>
<p> Sure, turning off the Blue Light Filter can resolve the Yellow screen problem, but what if you can’t turn it off? And that’s exactly what a few users reported. </p>
<p> Apparently, this happens when a backup of a non-Samsung phone (most commonly the Pixel 2/3) is restored. Samsung integrated its own Blue Light Filter into One UI and removed the stock one. So, when you restore a Pixel backup, you bring your old Blue Light settings, and the filter stays on no matter what you do. </p>
<p> The solution for this is to remove the Blue Light Filter settings on your old phone, create a new backup, and set up the S10 once again. But I imagine that’s too much hassle, especially if you’ve been using your new phone for a while. So, another thing you can try is using the Activity Launcher to initiate the activity linked to the night shift feature that will reset the settings, as explained on the XDA forums. </p>
<p> Another thing that could disrupt the Blue Light filter is Google Play Books’ night light settings. So, if you’re using Google Play Books, make sure to check this setting. </p>
<p> 6. Poor video playback quality </p>
<p> Video playback on Instagram, Facebook, and other platforms seems to be poor for some users. Namely, the video appears pixelated, even if its native resolution is high. </p>
<p> There’s no known solution for this issue at the moment. I can recommend you to try generic troubleshooting steps, like checking your internet connection or disabling the Data Saver. However, I can’t be positive any of that will be helpful. </p>
<p> If the exact solution appears somewhere, I’ll update the article as soon as possible. </p>
<p> 7. Bluetooth problems </p>
<p> Just like it’s the case with many other phones, it looks like the Bluetooth issues haven’t bypassed the S10 either. Users are complaining about all sorts of Bluetooth-related issues. Whether it’s the car, Bluetooth speakers, headphones, etc. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, there’s no specific solution for any of the Bluetooth issues, yet. It looks like users experiencing these problems will have to wait for Samsung to release a patching update. </p>
<p> 8. Battery life issues </p>
<p> The consensus on the Galaxy S10’s battery life is positive. Sure, the battery capacity could be bigger, but people are mainly satisfied with it. However, there are still individual cases where users encounter problems. </p>
<p> As the battery drain is such a broad term, and millions of things can affect the battery life, I can’t precisely tell what’s causing the problem for you. It could be the Always-on display, the fingerprint sensor, or some other feature or service. All in all, the Galaxy S10 is packed with potential battery vampires that will suck a good portion out of the battery if not put under control. </p>
<p> 1. Turn off (modify) the Always On Display feature </p>
<p> Sure, the Always On Display is a great feature that eliminates the need to wake up your phone when checking time, for example. But it’s also a known battery drainer. Not a major one tho, but it will still consume up to 10% of the battery on a daily basis. So, if that makes a difference, you can disable this feature, or at least modify it. </p>
<p> Here’s how to disable Always On Display: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Lock Screen </p>
<p> Toggle the Always On Display option off (or long-press to access additional options). </p>
<p> Now that the Always On Display is always off, you don’t have to worry about potential battery drains anymore. However, if you’re used to this feature, you don’t have to turn it completely off to save battery. Instead, adjust it to meet your needs and still curtail energy expenditure. </p>
<p> There are two additional options next to turning off Always On Display, and these are Tap to show and Show as scheduled. I don’t have to explain what does the Tap to show option do (the screen stays on for 30 seconds after each tap), while the Show as scheduled allows you to set a schedule for when you want to use Always On display, and the feature will only work during the selected time frame. </p>
<p> 2. Uninstall battery draining apps </p>
<p> Uninstalling apps which drain more battery than they should is one of the most cliché solutions you can try. But it’s effective. Especially if you’ve set up a backup from your previous phone, which probably brought apps you don’t even know are there. </p>
<p> To determine which apps drain the battery the most, check the Battery usage feature, and you’ll get the idea. The next step, of course, is to uninstall the battery-thirsty app, or at least limit its power consumption (depending on the app). </p>
<p> To check the battery usage, go to Settings > Device care > Battery Usage. </p>
<p> 3. Set up the Power Saving mode </p>
<p> n case you can’t determine the exact cause of the battery drain problem, enable the Power Saving mode. As you might’ve expected, this feature will save tremendous amounts of battery, but will also limit the phone’s performance. You can choose between multiple power-saving options, depending on how much consumption you want to cut. </p>
<p> Obviously, the maximum power saving mode will significantly improve the battery life, but it will also cripple the abilities of your phone to the point it’ll only be able to perform basic functions. So, we will aim for the medium mode here, which will save some battery, but won’t drastically affect performance. </p>
<p> To set up the medium power saving mode, go to Settings > Device care > Power mode, and choose Medium power saving mode. </p>
<p> 9. Cellular signal issues </p>
<p> According to a few users, certain Galaxy S10 phones have a cellular signal/data problems. Users cannot use the cellular data, or make calls and send messages. As the number of complaints raised recently, Samsung acknowledged the problem and released a patch. </p>
<p> So, if you’re still experiencing problems with your cellular signal, just update your phone, and it should resolve the problem. </p>
<p> 10. Bad Bluetooth audio quality </p>
<p> The Galaxy S10 has a headphone jack! The company didn’t stray away from its original principle of keeping both sides of the jack debate happy. But Bluetooth earbuds are popular, and are now the premier choice for many users, especially with the Galaxy Buds in the play. </p>
<p> And that’s where problems may arise, as a few users reported bad audio quality when using their Bluetooth earbuds or speakers with the Galaxy S10. Since the S10 is a well-made phone, that shouldn’t allow technical issues like this, the problem most likely lays in your Bluetooth settings </p>
<p> It’s probably a codec problem, because not all codecs are created equally. If you’re not familiar with the way Bluetooth codecs work, check out this article, because there’s no need to dig into the details here. </p>
<p> If you’re experiencing the drop in sound quality from your Bluetooth device, check if you’re using the right codec. </p>
<p> To change the default Bluetooth codec, you first need to enable the Developer Options. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Scroll down and tap About phone > Software information. </p>
<p> Find the Build number section. </p>
<p> Start tapping the Build number section continuously until you get a pop-up message saying that you’re a Developer now. </p>
<p> After this, the Developer Options section will appear in the Settings. </p>
<p> Now, that you’re “a developer”, it’s time to change your Bluetooth codec. Most phones use the SBC codec by default, which is now outdated, and you should switch to the aptX codec for better audio quality. Here’s how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Developer Options. </p>
<p> Scroll down, and open Bluetooth Audio Codec. </p>
<p> Select aptX HD from the list of codecs. </p>
<p> After changing the default audio codec to aptX HD, the sound quality should improve. However, the quality of your Bluetooth earbuds also matters, as you can’t expect wonders from a cheap pair of earbuds you bought on Amazon past Black Friday. So, keep that in mind, as well. </p>
<p> That’s about it. As you can see, even the Galaxy S10 has its flaws, which proves the theory that nothing’s perfect. Even if it costs that much. I hope this article helped you resolve your problem with the Galaxy S10. If you’ve encountered an issue, I didn’t mention in this article, feel free to write it down in the comments below. </p>

<p> Samsung Galaxy S6 Nougat issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> For a lot of Android users around the globe lies the dilemma: older flagship or brand new mid-budget. If you ask us, we are cheering on the side of the older flagship devices. </p>
<p> For example, Samsung Galaxy S6. Amazing device, great design, sleek but occasionally erratic TouchWiz, stunning camera. What more you would expect from an Android smartphone? Well, lack of the timely and functioning software updates may come in question, but only because that’s a general problem with Samsung and not an individual handset issue. </p>
<p> So, recently, users of S6 received the Nougat via OTA update. And then the hell broke loose. Many of them reported a lot of issues and today we provided a list of most common issues and possible workarounds for each individual reported the problem. If you have a hard time with your S6 after an update, make sure to check the list below. </p>
<p> Call issues </p>
<p> We had to start with the essential feature that some users reported as broken. Well, imagine that you own an amazing feature-rich device but, there’s a little negligible problem: you can’t answer your calls. That happened to some users. The phone is ringing but nothing is shown on the screen. This is how one user explained the problem: </p>
<p> ”Since the Android update yesterday I go through periods where I cannot answer incoming calls. The phone rings but there is no indicator that there is an incoming call and icons or anything to even answer the incoming call. How do I correct this? I can restart my phone and I can answer incoming calls for a brief period then it start all over again where I can’t answer them. I have changed nothing on my phone. The only thing that has happened was the Android upgrade” </p>
<p> There’s an alternative, but the only permanent solution is a factory reset. At least, if you want to answer to your calls like you used to before the Nougat update. For an alternative solution, you can navigate to Settings > Accessibility > Answering and end calls > and enable “Answer calls by pressing the home key”. </p>
<p> However, you can perform a factory reset and have a good chance of resolving this issue. This is how to do it: </p>
<p> Backup your data and make sure that the phone’s battery is at least on 30%. </p>
<p> Open Backup & restore. </p>
<p> Tap Reset device. </p>
<p> Tap Erase everything. </p>
<p> Your device will restart and you should be able to answer calls just like before an update. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Even the fundamental connectivity was struck down for some users. Namely, some of them reported that they were unable to connect to both home or public networks after the update. One user offered a concise description of the problem at hand: </p>
<p> ”Got the new Android upday today (I have an S6) and tonight I couldn’t connect to a public Wi-Fi network. How do i fix this? I had no issues connecting before the update.” </p>
<p> These are some steps you should take in order to address the Wi-Fi issues: </p>
<p> Restart the router. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, make sure to address the issue to your carrier support center. </p>
<p> Camera issues </p>
<p> It seems that some of the native camera features are gone with the latest update. Allegedly, after the update, some users lost filters that were available on the previous Android version. This is how one user described his/her concerns regarding the subject: </p>
<p> ”I’ve only had my phone running for a day with the latest update, but the grayscale camera filter seems to be MIA and the low light resolution is sub par now. I always found the grayscale filter to give better photos in low light, so even though I can edit a color photo to make it grey…it’s not at all the same. I don’t see grayscale as an option for a filter to download, but has anyone else run into this and found a solution?” </p>
<p> As you would imagine, there isn’t a practical workaround for this. However, you can use an alternative app before the next system update to utilize your camera’s full potential with all the needed features. </p>
<p> Buttons/keys issues </p>
<p> Another key feature (no pun intended) is broken for some users. Namely, the Power and Home keys are unresponsive for some users periodically after the update rollout. This is how one S6 owner explained his problem and the way her/he resolved it: </p>
<p> ”After the Nougat update my power button intermittently stopped working, i.e. unable to turn screen on or if it is on, turn it off. Holding it down does nothing. After charging it for a bit, the problem seemed to go away. It was over 60% charged when I noticed the problem. Similarly, the home button either did nothing or opened Google assistant (did not hold the button, simply tapped it). I powered off and on. I cleared the cache. Yet the problem still persisted. For NOW, it seems to have returned to working normally. Only thing I did was let it charge for about 30 minutes during a car ride. There is something unstable in the code.’‘ </p>
<p> As you can see, this issue is somehow resolved by charging. On the other hand, if this strange occurrence is still there after a while, you should perform the factory reset. </p>
<p> Battery issues </p>
<p> Battery drains aren’t exactly a novelty for Samsung updates. After the S7 and S7 Edge battery issues, the battery life is substantially decreased on S6, as well. One user shared a thorough explanation behind this issue: </p>
<p> ”I’ve had my Samsung Galaxy S6 for around 16 months now. It seems like over the past 3-4 months the battery life has gotten worse, I’ve experienced a weird problem a few times too. Today, I was surprised look at my phone and see that the battery life was much lower than it should have been, since I had not been using my phone, it had just been in my pocket. Looking at the battery life chart in settings confirmed that there was a sudden drop in battery life a couple hours ago.” </p>
<p> As you can see for yourself, sudden drops of battery percentage are not uncommon after the update. However, you can perform a few tweaks to improve your battery life and those can be found in this article. </p>
<p> Wireless charging issues </p>
<p> Wireless charging is also impacted by the update. Some users reported that they’re unable to charge their devices with wireless chargers as soon as the system updated. One user summarized the problem this way: </p>
<p> ”Is anyone else having a problem with wireless charging after Nougat update? I keep my wireless charger on my desk at work. I did my update and then left. Came in the next day and the wireless isnt charging. Its not the charger because someone with an S7 and S8 have both tested it and they can charge on it. Any one else having this problem ?” </p>
<p> If you’re certain that the wireless charger is functional, you can wipe the cache partition and, if that’s not of any use, restore the factory settings. </p>
<p> Reboot/boot loop issues </p>
<p> Now, this is a dealbreaker for most of the users. Once they’ve installed the Nougat update, their respective devices get stuck on the welcome screen or the random resets started. One user presented the problem he has to cope with after the update: </p>
<p> ”Hi, I tried to update my firmware with the new Nougat upgrade last night. When I retrieved my phone this morning, it was frozen on the Verizon screen. I tried all of the tricks: rebooting the system, rebooting to bootloader, wiping the cache partition, and even doing a hard factory reset. Nothing has worked – not even the factory reset! It still freezes on the Verizon screen. Any advice for a self fix before I take it to a repair shop? Thanks!” </p>
<p> It seems that there’s no solution at the moment, at least not the one that can be performed by users themselves. So, if you’ve experienced similar issues, make sure to take your device to a service center. </p>
<p> Voicemail issues </p>
<p> This issue is not as much connected to a voicemail as it is an interface bug that causes the message playback to stop after the phone is close to your ear. It seems that the sensor bug affects the voicemail playback. Here is the description of the problem provided by one user: </p>
<p> ”I have visual voicemail and anytime I hit play and then put the phone to my ear to listen to the message the message pauses. The only way for me to listen to the voicemail is to put it on speaker phone. Anybody know a fix to this?” </p>
<p> Until now, the 3 workarounds proven as the best-suited for the job. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Voicemail app > Force stop, and restart your device. </p>
<p> Disable all lock screen security measures (pattern, PIN, password). </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset. </p>
<p> But, for most of the users, the problem is still there. So, we should expect some fixes in the upcoming app and system versions. </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> At the end, it’s important to say that some of these may be the isolated cases and the Nougat update work’s as intended on your Samsung handset. However, there’s also a possibility that we missed some of the issues, so you’re welcome to share them in the comments section. </p>
<p> Either way, we certainly hope that the Samsung and the carriers will work their way out of this in the next update that’s at the moment in the beta stage. </p>

<p> Hi. I had all but given up trying to find s solution to the problems i have had since the 7.0 upgrade. Im in Australia, so not sure where you guy’s are or if the upgrades were rolled out the same way. Ill try keep this brief as possible. I have, or did have, a galaxy s6 and loved it. Turned it on on one morning to find it in the process of an update, later to find out that it was a forced upgrade to the 7.0. Immediately all the problems started. it was stuck in a constant boot… Read more » </p>

<p> Fix: Samsung Galaxy S7 screen is too sensitive </p>
<p> As you may already know, it’s impossible to change the screen sensitivity on the S7. The default settings are well-optimized and you shouldn’t experience any issues. However, some users reported the, after some time, their screen become overly sensitive and that made it harder for a seamless use. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we conducted a research and provided you with the possible workarounds. You can find those just below. </p>
<p> How to resolve overly sensitive touchscreen on Samsung Galaxy s7 </p>
<p> Update firmware </p>
<p> If you’re certain that something has changed and that your screen sensitivity has drastically increased, you may want to check for updates because it’s probably the software issue. As some users advised, most of the issues emerged after the Nougat update. Since there are some newer versions that should patch up issues at hand, there’s a chance that your problem can be resolved with the timely update. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap System. </p>
<p> Open About device. </p>
<p> If the updates are available, make sure to install them. </p>
<p> In case the problem persists, you can turn to some other solutions below. </p>
<p> Reset Apps preference </p>
<p> Some users reported that the problem is non-existent in the Safe mode. That leads to the obvious conclusion that the culprit for the issue is to be found within the 3rd-party apps that somehow affected the screen sensitivity. It’s not always easy to locate which app has created the unwanted changes but try to remember the first occurrence of the issue and the apps you had installed at the time. </p>
<p> On the other hand, the problem may lie in the built-in system interface apps that, for no apparent reason changed settings. Since there’s no way to customize the touchscreen sensitivity, it’s safe to say that the resetting of the app’s preference will resolve this issue. </p>
<p> Remove screen protector or casing </p>
<p> Screen Protectors or protective casings are a must-have for a lot of the users. If you’re not a superhero when it comes to concentration, there’s a chance that you’ll drop your phone once or twice. And those can be fatal in the worst case scenario. Since the S7 is, no matter how much protected, still a sensitive device, you’ll need a casing to keep your expensive flagship safe at all times. </p>
<p> However, the casing might, besides the overheating, cause the misbehavior of the touchscreen. For that purpose, we advise you to remove it and look for changes. Moreover, if you’re using a tempered glass as a screen protector, make sure that’s placed properly to avoid the sensitivity issues. </p>
<p> Reset to factory settings </p>
<p> At the end, if none of the previous steps we provided proved useful, you should turn to a factory reset. We can’t be sure what caused the oversensitivity changes on your device, so it’s advised to restore factory settings. With the clean wipe, you can be certain that whatever the software problem is at hand, it should be gone after the procedure is finished. Moreover, you can always backup your data, so nothing except the settings will be terminally lost. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below and we should resolve the problem in a few easy steps: </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Restore. </p>
<p> Open Factory Data Reset. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and insert your passcode or PIN. </p>
<p> After the procedure is done, you should be able to move on with the seamless use just like before the screen issues started. However, if the problem is hardware-related, we advise you to take your S7 to service store. And you’ll now that it’s hardware-related if it reoccurs after the factory reset. </p>
<p> At the end, we hope that you’ll find these instructions helpful. In addition, don’t forget to post questions or alternative solutions in the comments section. Thank you for reading. </p>

<p> Fix: Samsung Galaxy S10 Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Samsung’s flagship S series are among the most popular Android devices out there. And for a lot of reasons. However, many users have had a hard time with Wi-Fi on their S9/S10 devices, especially the Samsung Galaxy S10. It seems that their devices either won’t connect at all or Wi-Fi is unstable and disconnects frequently. In case you have any S10 Wi-Fi issues on the S10, make sure to check the steps below. </p>
<p> Why is my S10 not connecting to WiFi? </p>
<p> It seems that there’s a major bug that’s resolved by updating the firmware. Allegedly, Samsung addressed it with an update. If updating doesn’t help, consider following the steps we listed below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Reboot the phone and the router </p>
<p> The first thing to try is restarting your wireless router and your handset. If there’s an IP conflict at hand, this should address it. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you already tried this to no avail, continue to the next step. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Forget the network and connect again </p>
<p> The next troubleshooting step to try is forgetting the troubling home network and re-enabling it again. This is done within the Wi-Fi settings menu of available networks. Once you forget the network, reboot your device, enter your credentials, and connect again. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to forget and reconnect to a Wi-Fi network on your Samsung Galaxy S10: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open Connections. </p>
<p> Tap Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Turn on Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Tap and hold on the preferred network and then select Forget network. </p>
<p> Restart your phone and connect again. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Tweak router settings </p>
<p> Some users who had Wi-Fi issues on their S10 fixed the problem by tweaking certain router settings. There are multiple things you can tweak, and we recommend disabling all network optimization options. All device-limiting options on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz wireless frequencies. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can stick to 2.4 GHz frequency for the time being or, as the last resort, reset your router to factory settings and investigate settings again. If you are not sure how to access router settings, we recommend suggesting your ISP support. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Update the S10 and router’s firmware </p>
<p> Based on a lot of reports, S10 Wi-Fi issues stopped occurring after users updated their devices to the latest monthly update. Samsung seemingly heard about S9/S10 connectivity issues and addressed them accordingly in a patch. </p>
<p> So, navigate to Settings > System updates > Download and install (if there are available updates). After you’ve installed the latest update, the Wi-Fi issues on your S10 should be gone. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reset Network settings </p>
<p> If the previous step hasn’t helped you, make sure to go and reset your S10 Network settings. Have in mind that this action will remove all saved SSIDs, Bluetooth pairings, and APN settings. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reset network settings to factory values on the Samsung Galaxy S10: </p>
<p> Choose General management. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Select Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Reset your S10 to factory settings </p>
<p> Now, as the final resort, we can only suggest resetting your device to factory settings. Considering how cumbersome this restoring everything might be, we recommend this step only if you depleted all your options. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reset your S10 to factory settings in a few simple steps: </p>
<p> Back up everything from your internal storage to an SD card or cloud. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose General management and then Reset. </p>
<p> Select Factory data reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset and then tap Delete all. </p>
<p> And, on that note, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to share your thoughts with us in the comments section below. If you have any other solutions to suggest, please do so below. </p>

<p> Fix: Samsung Smart Manager notification issues </p>
<p> You don’t get to be a leader in any field without innovations. Samsung is well and truly leading the smartphone industry in many categories, though, occasionally, some pre-installed features can be more of a problem than a solution. </p>
<p> That goes for the built-in system manager that comes as a default solution for security and maintenance. Now, Smart Manager is truly ”smart”, at least, most of the time. However, users reported various issues, and most of them orbit around over irritating notifications. </p>
<p> Namely, they are supposed to inform users if a rogue application is overeager to delete phone resources. And that’s a good thing. On the other hand, if that is repeating constantly, and even though you took necessary steps or the phone is behaving well, then it’s reasonable to expect it to stop. But it won’t. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we prepared multiple workarounds you should take into consideration. If you’re tired of repetitive notifications about a resource-hogging app, follow the steps below. </p>
<p> How to resolve frequent notifications on Samsung’s Smart Manager </p>
<p> Clear app’s cache and data </p>
<p> In order to address this problem, let’s check the app first. It’s not unusual for 3rd-party apps, especially the ones that work in the background, to hog on your system resources. Facebook Messenger is well-known for that. Now, primarily, they might behave as intended, but throughout the extended use, with piles of data stored, the consumption levels may arise. So, what you’ll need to do is to clear cache and data from a troubled app and look for changes. Hopefully, after that, Smart Manager won’t bother you anymore. </p>
<p> Navigate to a resource-hogging app. </p>
<p> Tap the app and open Storage. </p>
<p> Repeat the procedure for all troubled apps that are related to annoying, all-day-popping notifications. </p>
<p> Update the troubled app </p>
<p> In addition, after certain system updates or changes inflicted over time, certain apps might have a discourse with the present system version. The unoptimized app isn’t the good app, or whatever the saying. Joke aside, it’s vital to have installed up-to-date apps. If you skip on the updates, there’s a chance that you’re missing a fix or improvements of stability improvements. </p>
<p> Tap the Play Store app. </p>
<p> Open a 3-stripe menu from the left. </p>
<p> Tap My Apps & Games. </p>
<p> Select Check for updates. </p>
<p> If there are some updates available, make sure to install them. </p>
<p> This isn’t a certain solution since some developers choose to neglect app while others prefer cosmetic improvements over stability and overall usefulness. </p>
<p> Reinstall the troubled app </p>
<p> Starting from a scratch is always a viable workaround when something unexpectedly goes wrong. Most of the apps you’ll meet are eventually going to suffer and reinstallation is an obvious choice. It goes the same for both Play Store and APK apps. If you’re uncertain how to do it, follow the instructions below and, in a few easy steps, you should be relieved of the “This app is causing your device to run slowly” prompts. </p>
<p> Tap and hold the alleged resource-vampire app and move it to the top of the screen to uninstall it. </p>
<p> Restart your device swiftly. </p>
<p> Enable Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Tap Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for the app or find it within your Library. </p>
<p> Install the app and check for changes. </p>
<p> Clear Smart Manager’s cache </p>
<p> Even though Smart Manager is quite a handy built-in tool, some users might disagree and call it bloatware solely because of the fact that you can’t erase it. At least, if your device isn’t rooted. Then you can do basically everything. What you can do is reset to factory settings, so to say. That can be done by the simple clearing of cache and data. </p>
<p> Navigate to a Smart Manager. </p>
<p> Tap the app and open Storage. </p>
<p> Use an alternative app </p>
<p> If your Smart Manager isn’t running wild and a certain app indeed negatively impacts your phone’s performance, you should take a replacement into consideration. Every major app you might be using has a valid lighter version or an alternative. For example, if you’re unsatisfied how the official Facebook app impacts your system, it’s obvious choice to switch to something else, like Tinfoil or Friendly. </p>
<p> Maybe the latest flagships won’t be affected, but the lack of optimization can lead to overconsumption and similar issues on the older handsets. So, look up for a replacement and you should have much better time with the performance while relieving yourself of those pesky notifications. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if nothing seems to work in your favor and the phone’s ludicrous and erratic behavior is over the point of no return, the factory reset should be an obvious choice. Back in the days, without the proper cloud support, this whole procedure would be an overwhelmingly bothersome. But, nowadays, you can backup and restore your data in no more than 30 minutes. Including the resetting procedure. Don’t forget to backup your data on the cloud or your PC with the Samsung’s Smart Switch PC Suite. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Restore. </p>
<p> Choose Factory Data Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Device. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and insert your passcode or PIN. </p>
<p> That should do it. Samsung isn’t one of those OEM’s that offer cleanest stock Android in the market, which doesn’t entirely means that the preinstalled apps are not useful. However, if you have had issues with Smart Manager, we certainly hope that this was a helpful read. </p>

<p> How to save battery life on your Asus ZenFone 3 </p>
<p> Asus made a breakthrough in the budget class mobile phone market with latest add to the ZenFone family: ZenFone 3. On the first sight, this phone looks great and, performance-wise is pretty reliable for its price. In addition, Asus ZenFone 3 is equipped with the battery which autonomy is great comparing to its competitors. </p>
<p> However, if you are using it frequently (as many of us do), your battery will run out for a couple of hours. To prevent that and extend it, you may want to use some of our tips and tricks. </p>
<p> How to extend your battery life on Asus ZenFone 3 in no time </p>
<p> Kill the pesky background apps </p>
<p> Even though you don use them at the time, some apps will work in the background and slow your phone down. Also, ti will deploy your battery faster. First, you need to hunt them down and then exterminate them. To solve this do the following: </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Tap Power Management </p>
<p> Select Power Consumption Table </p>
<p> Find the apps that are consuming battery even though you are not using them at the time </p>
<p> Disable those apps </p>
<p> Adjust the brightness of display if high level is not necessary </p>
<p> If you are on the bright background and your display have good visibility, then you should lower the brightness of your screen. As we all know, a display is the main consumer of the battery. To do that, carry out this instruction: </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Select Display </p>
<p> Tap Brightness </p>
<p> Lower your brightness </p>
<p> Activate Power Saver option </p>
<p> One of the easiest ways to save your battery life is to use Android OS implemented option. Yeah, good guess, it’s Power Saver. To activate Power Saver, do as follows: </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Select Power Managment </p>
<p> Turn Power Saver ON </p>
<p> Use Auto-start manager to deny unwanting apps from starting </p>
<p> Auto-start manager is app implemented in Asus phones that let you choose whether some apps will auto-start or would need to be started manually. This is the great option if you want to get rid of battery-deploying apps that are not of primary importance. </p>
<p> Launch the application </p>
<p> Select application that you want to prohibit from starting </p>
<p> Choose Deny </p>
<p> Disable Auto-sync and Auto-update </p>
<p> Auto-sync and Auto-update are great options to give you one less worry about Android usage. All the updates will perform in the background and you won’t even notice until it is done. However, if you are in no need to update your apps or sync, you as well may turn it off. It will prolong your battery life. You can do it later manually. </p>
<p> Open Play Store>Settings </p>
<p> Disable Auto-update apps </p>
<p> Open Settings>Personal>Accounts & Sync </p>
<p> Disable Auto-sync </p>
<p> Disable Auto-rotate screen </p>
<p> Auto-rotate is comfy option to change your screen orientation. Although it is not the main consumer, it will most certainly speed up your battery drainage. If you don’t find it necessary, you may as well disable it. </p>
<p> Go to Settings </p>
<p> Tap Display </p>
<p> Disable Auto-rotate screen </p>
<p> Think about using standard instead of Live wallpaper </p>
<p> Live wallpaper is nice aesthetic but its usage can make your battery suffer. Therefore, you may want to rethink it if you are away from recharging opportunity. If you are not so much into risking, select standard wallpaper. </p>
<p> Press and hold on Home Screen </p>
<p> Tap Wallpapers icon </p>
<p> Change your live wallpaper for standard one </p>
<p> Remove unused Widgets from the Home Screen </p>
<p> Widgets are one of the premium attributes of Android OS. Also, one of the trademarks. But, if you are not using some of them, their background work will slow your phone. Battery life will suffer, too. </p>
<p> Tap and hold unused Widget </p>
<p> While holding, move the widget to the top of the screen </p>
<p> Place it in Remove section </p>
<p> Those were our tips concerning saving your battery life. We hope you find it helpful and get the 110% out of your Asus ZenFone 3. </p>

<p> How to save a Google Doc as a PDF on Android </p>
<p> If you want to send a Google Docs document as an email attachment or even via instant messengers, the best way is to convert it to a PDF file. However, downloading and then converting docs to PDF might be cumbersome. Luckily, you can save a Google Doc as a PDF file locally withing the Google Docs app for Android. </p>
<p> Learn how to do this below. </p>
<p> How do I save a Google Doc as a PDF? </p>
<p> Although Google Docs documents are easy to open on Android devices as many built-in apps can access them, converting them to PDF format makes it much easier for sharing. Especially if you want to make those digital documents available and easily accessible on different platforms. </p>
<p> These days, you won’t even need a specialized third-party PDF reader app to access them, as OEM’s usually offer built-in readers. Additionally, there’s Google Drive’s PDF reader to come to the rescue if needed. </p>
<p> Downloading or saving digital documents from Google Docs locally is a walk in a park. Both on the web-based client and within the Android app that’s the point of our interest today. The only problem is batch downloading which is missing. </p>
<p> Of course, you can save all files in the original Doc format or Docx format (used on Microsoft Word) and convert them with a third-party PDF converter. This can be hard to do on your handset, which is the main reason we suggest using your PC for batch downloads. </p>
<p> How to save Google Docs documents as PDFs with ease </p>
<p> Now, without further ado, here’s how to save a Google Doc as a PDF file: </p>
<p> Open Google Docs. </p>
<p> Locate the document you want to download as a PDF file and open it. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and select Share & export from the contextual menu. </p>
<p> Then, tap Save as. </p>
<p> Finally, select the PDF Document (.pdf) from the list and tap OK. </p>
<p> That’s it. Now you have a PDF version of a text document. As simple as that. You can then upload the file again to Google Drive, share it with your friends or colleagues, or transfer it to your PC. </p>
<p> Thanks for reading and don’t forget to tell us this was an informative read or not. The comments section is just below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/screen-recording-doesnt-work-ios" parent_folder="web1" id="file17840880" filename="screen-recording-doesnt-work-ios">
<p> Fix: Screen Recording doesn’t work on iOS 14 </p>
<p> Apple didn’t change iPhone’s Screen Recording feature at all on iOS 14. And there’s a good reason for that. Screen Recording is already the best screen-capturing app/feature on the market (counting both iOS and Android). It’s as simple as it gets and does exceptionally. So, there’s no need to fix what’s not broken. </p>
<p> Except that Screen Recording is actually broken for some users. Although a small number, there are still some people who reported that they’re unable to record screen on iOS 14. If you’re among them, I’ll try to help you resolve the problem, and revive the Screen Recording feature on your iPhone. </p>
<p> Since this isn’t a widespread issue on iOS 14, we’ll try some older workarounds that helped people with the same problem before, and perhaps will get the job done here, as well. Keep reading. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check restrictions </p>
<p> The most common reason why screen recording doesn’t work is if it’s in the list of restricted apps and content. This is especially likely if you share your phone with your child. </p>
<p> So, before doing anything else, head over to Screen Time and make sure Screen Recording isn’t “blacklisted”. Here’s exactly how to do that: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Open Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions. </p>
<p> Tap Content Restrictions. </p>
<p> Scroll down. Under Game Center, make sure Screen Recording is set to Allow. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Reboot your iPhone </p>
<p> Before moving on, I’ll quickly stop to tell you to reboot your iPhone. Although I’m not sure a fresh start will help, it’ll bring your phone back to its optimal state, and who knows, maybe Screen Recording will start working again. </p>
<p> To reboot your iPhone, press and hold the Side button + the Volume Up button at the same time until the power off slider appears. Now, just drag the slider, and wait for a couple of seconds for your iPhone to power off. When your iPhone turns back on, check if Screen Recording now works. If it doesn’t, we’ll try another solution. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Check for updates </p>
<p> iOS updates are generally something you should be looking forward to. Most of them introduce bigger or smaller features or at least make your iPhone more secure. On the other hand, it’s not a rarity for an update to mess up an already well-functioning feature on your iPhone. </p>
<p> If you suspect that may be the case here and that you’re unable to record because an update messed up the Screen Recording feature, your only option is probably just to wait for another update that will eventually fix the problem. </p>
<p> In the meantime, you could try using a third-party screen recorder from the App Store, although I doubt there’s any better than the built-in one. After all, Apple is the champion of first-party apps. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check the storage </p>
<p> If you’re unable to save your recordings, there’s a good chance you don’t have enough storage on your iPhone to store the clip. Now, these screen recordings don’t take up too much space, certainly not as much as that 4k 60 FPS video you took with your rear camera, but it can add up. </p>
<p> So, head over to Settings > General > iPhone Storage, and check if there’s any available space left. And while you’re there, you can take a minute and optimize your iPhone’s storage by deleting unnecessary apps or files, just to keep it better organized and prevent future “low on storage” messages. </p>
<p> Bonus #1: Make sure you’re allowed to record </p>
<p> You should keep in mind that you’re not allowed to record just about any screen on your iPhone. For example, you can’t record anything in the Netflix app, with some other video streaming apps not being an exception. </p>
<p> The reasons for this are obvious. And that’s fighting piracy. Most streaming platforms won’t allow you to screen-record content inside the app, simply because it would probably the easiest possible way for pirates to illegally snatch movies and TV shows from these platforms. </p>
<p> I know this would also be an amazing way for you to make memes (I know I would meme the hell out of Netflix if I could), but we have to respect content distributors and their efforts to protect the intellectual property they hold exclusive licenses for. </p>
<p> Bonus #2: Add Screen Recording to Control Center </p>
<p> The only way to access Screen Recording on your iPhone is from the Control Center. It should be there by default, but in case it isn’t, here’s how to bring it back: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Control Center. </p>
<p> Under More controls, find Screen Recording and tap the green plus to add it to the Control Center. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the Screen Recorder issue on iOS 14. In case you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, feel free to let us know in the comments below. </p>

<p> How to check screen time in Android Pie </p>
<p> Controlling the daily usage of your phone is important. That’s what the self-help books and motivational speakers say, at least. And they’re right, of course, if we ignore the fact that they want to make money off you by saying that. But is the full control really possible? Especially in today’s world, where your whole life basically runs through your smartphone. </p>
<p> That’s a complex debate for people way more competent than I am. So I’m not going to initiate it, and risk saying something I might regret. Instead, I’ll go fully technical (like I always do here at Mobile Internist), and show you how to check the screen time on your smartphone running Android 9 Pie. Because that’s why you’re here in the first place, right? </p>
<p> As you probably already know, there are two ways of doing anything on an Android phone. You can use built-in tools, or you can seek help from third-party apps. And controlling the screen time is not an exception. </p>
<p> Use Digital Wellbeing </p>
<p> If you’re using a Pixel device or a device that’s running Android One, you can check the usage time with Digital Wellbeing. As its name says, this feature is designed to help you use your phone more responsibility and prevent distractions. </p>
<p> Digital Wellbeing is simple in design. It shows app usage by time, as well as the number of unlocks and notifications. There are also additional features, like scheduling the Do Not Disturb mode and the Wind Down feature, which applies Greyscale to your screen to ease looking at the screen at night. </p>
<p> To access Digital Wellbeing, simply go to Settings > Digital Wellbeing. You can also show its icon in the app drawer. </p>
<p> But if your device doesn’t support Digital Wellbeing, try the alternatives listed below. </p>
<p> Check screen time through Power Usage </p>
<p> If you don’t want to install any third-party apps that will allow you to tell your screen time, your phone’s power status got you covered. Of course, it shows battery usage and time on battery, which can be translated into screen time. </p>
<p> Here’s how to check screen time through Power Usage: </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Battery. </p>
<p> Tap the 3-dot menu, and go to Battery usage. </p>
<p> Tap the 3 dot menu again, and choose Show full device usage. </p>
<p> As you can see, the power graph and status show exactly for how much time your screen has been active. </p>
<p> The instructions above are for stock Android or Android One. The steps may vary on non-stock ROMs. But the principle stays the same, as all you have to do is look for the battery usage. </p>
<p> The obvious drawback of this method is that it only shows screen time since the last charge. So, you cannot sort the stats by days, hours or weeks. If you want to keep track of your daily screen time, you’ll have to install a third-party app. And that’s where Usage Time comes into play. </p>
<p> Install Usage Time </p>
<p> If the ‘stock way’ doesn’t provide enough info for you, you can always go with a third-party app. There are a couple of options in the Play Store, but I recommend Usage Time (not sponsored by), because of its simplicity. </p>
<p> The app just gives you what you want to know, without any unnecessary features and distractions. It just shows time spent with the screen on for the current day, divided between used apps. </p>
<p> There’s also a graph of the usage time, so you can easily keep the record of the phone use for the past week. </p>
<p> And that’s about it, as you can see, even though Android doesn’t offer the Screen Time feature by default like iOS does, there are still easy ways to check your usage status. If you have any comments, or know of some other, perhaps even more convenient way of checking the screen time in Android, don’t hesitate to let us know in the comments below. </p>

<p> How to send Zip files in Gmail on Android </p>
<p> In case you frequently send emails with attachments, you are probably used to sending them in the Zip file format. Today, we’ll explain how to send Zip files in Gmail on Android. </p>
<p> There are various reasons why you would send all Gmail attachments in the Zip format. First of all, this format will ensure that files are compressed so they’ll take less space (only 20 MB per email are allowed). Secondly, if there are numerous files, it’s easier to extract them solely to a single folder instead of downloading hundreds of them individually. </p>
<p> How do I attach a Zip file to Gmail? </p>
<p> If you thought that it’s impossible to attach Zip files as email attachments on Android, you were wrong. This is possible, although, by default, Gmail will offer solely multimedia files (images, audio, or video files) and documents. </p>
<p> However, if you open the “hamburger” menu and, presumably, have any file manager installed on your device, you can manually navigate to Zip files and attach them to your email. This applies to all non-regular files you want to attach to your emails. </p>
<p> Of course, thanks to Google’s integration of various services, you can also get files directly from Google Drive. Have in mind that Zip files (or any file for that matter) can take up to 20 MB. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to attach Zip files to Gmail on Android: </p>
<p> Open Gmail and make sure you are logged in with the preferred Gmail account. </p>
<p> Tap on the Plus sign at the bottom to create a new email. </p>
<p> Add recipient and subject. Also, any text if necessary. </p>
<p> Now, tap on the Paper Clip icon and then choose the Attach file. </p>
<p> Tap on the hamburger menu. You should see your device on the list. If you don’t see it, make sure to install any file manager from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Open your device from the list and navigate to the folder where the Zip file you want to send resides. </p>
<p> Tap on the file and then tap Select at the top. </p>
<p> Send email. </p>
<p> In case you want to add the file from Google Drive, just select Google Drive after tapping on the Paper Clip icon. Select the file and wait until it downloads for sending. </p>
<p> How to create a Zip file on Android? </p>
<p> Now, you might have a certain batch of files and want to Zip it but can’t access your PC at the time. There’s certainly a way to do so on your Android, you just need the right app. And, like many other services, the likes of WinRar or 7Zip are available on Android, too. </p>
<p> If you want to zip a batch of files and send them that way via email on your Android, that’s a rather simple task. Follow these instructions to create a Zip file with WinRar on Android: </p>
<p> Locate and select files you want to add to a Zip archive. </p>
<p> Tap on the Plus Archive icon at the top. </p>

<p> How to set custom vibrations on your Android phone </p>
<p> The beauty of Android lays in the freedom it provides. Think of any customization you can do to your phone, and it’s likely possible in Android. The system itself allows you to do a lot, but if you add a few customization apps to the pack, you get a winning combination. </p>
<p> I personally prefer to go as stock as possible. Which means tweaking as many things inside the Settings app alone. Unfortunately, it’s not always possible to get what you want just from the Settings, and that’s when you’ll need to use customization apps. </p>
<p> It’s usually the little, unimportant things that make the difference. And that’s exactly what we’re talking about in this article. One of the little things users are unable to tweak inside Settings is vibration. Unlike ringtones, you simply cannot set a custom vibration for your calls, messages or notifications. </p>
<p> On top of that, Google has also cut the necessary permissions for apps like Good Vibrations, which are specifically designed for setting custom vibrations. So, the only solution now is to use apps that are not made solely for this purpose, but actually contain this ability, among other features. </p>
<p> The best apps for this purpose are MacroDroid and Textra SMS. So, I’m going to show you how to set custom vibrations using each one of these apps. </p>
<p> Set custom vibrations with MacroDroid </p>
<p> MacroDroid is one of the most powerful apps you can install on your phone. It allows you to completely automate the use of your device. Features and options this app offers are almost countless, so I’m not going to dig deeper into details, because our focus here is getting custom vibrations. </p>
<p> MacroDroid works on the principle of Triggers and Actions. Which means, you can set up each event that occurs on your phone to provoke a certain action. In our case, we’re going to set an incoming call/text/notification to trigger a custom vibration. </p>
<p> Tap Call/SMS, and choose which action you want to set a custom vibration for (Call Incoming or SMS Received). </p>
<p> Grant the necessary permissions. </p>
<p> Now, choose a specific contact (or a group of contacts) you want to set a custom vibration for. </p>
<p> Now, head over to the Actions tab. </p>
<p> Tap Device Actions > Vibrate. </p>
<p> Choose the vibration style from the list. </p>
<p> Tap the checkmark to save the macro. </p>
<p> That’s it, now every time a selected contact calls or sends a message, you’ll hear the custom vibration. </p>
<p> The obvious drawback of this method is that MacroDroid runs in the background all the time, which will consume battery faster. But if you’re okay with that, using MacroDroid is the decent solution for setting up a custom vibration on your phone. </p>
<p> Use Textra SMS </p>
<p> Another way of setting custom vibrations is by using Textra SMS. But obviously, you’re limited to text messages here. Textra SMS is one of the best third-party SMS apps for Android. It offers tons of customization features, including the ability to set custom vibrations for your messages. </p>
<p> Open the Textra SMS app. </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Customize Notifications. </p>
<p> Tap Vibrate pattern. </p>
<p> That’s it, now every time you receive a new message, you’ll hear the selected pattern. This is a convenient way of getting that customized vibration, if you don’t mind a third-party SMS app, of course. </p>
<p> Using MacroDroid or Textra SMS are the two most practical ways of setting up custom vibrations. However, if you know an even better solution, please share it with us in the comments down below. </p>

<p> How to set Data usage warnings in iOS </p>
<p> Controlling your data usage is essential. You don’t want to pay more than you should for an already expensive package. And in today’s tech, where pretty much everything’s connected to the internet, you can ‘waste’ a huge portion of your data without even knowing it. </p>
<p> That makes keeping track of all those spent megabytes and gigabytes tricky, especially in iOS. Because the way your iPhone allows you to control your data is not really convenient, to say the least. </p>
<p> Sure, you can always go to the Data section of Settings to check the consumption, but that’s pretty much it. And I’m almost certain you’ll forget to check the data usage one day, and you’ll go over the limit. For example, Android pushes data limit warnings to users in form of notifications. But sadly, that’s not the case with iOS for some reason. Despite users’ requests, Apple still hasn’t included this feature in iOS (maybe we’ll finally see it in iOS 13). So, you’re on your own when it comes to measuring your mileage. </p>
<p> Now that you know you simply can’t get a notification when you’re nearing the data limit, let’s look for some alternatives that can bring the data usage before your eyes, so you don’t forget to slow down when nearing the limit. </p>
<p> Use DataFlow Manager </p>
<p> Since iOS is not designed to push data limit warnings in form of notifications, the closest thing to push alerts is getting a widget. There are numerous data managers that will give you deep insight into your data usage. But do you really need all that insightful info? If you ask me, the majority of users are just interested in how much data they have left for this month. And for that purpose, a simple widget will get the job done. </p>
<p> That’s why I’ve chosen the DataFlow Manager app (this post is not sponsored by them). Sure, this app also gives you deep insight into your monthly cycle of data usage, but that’s not what we’re focusing on here. DataFlow Manager simply has a very convenient, minimalistic widget, that shows the current state of your data plan. </p>
<p> That’s it, the whole philosophy. Just install the DataFlow Manager app, swipe to the Widgets area, and add its widget to the Notification center. The widget will show you the remaining data, along with how many days are left in the billing cycle. </p>
<p> There’s really nothing more to say about this widget. It’s practical, minimalistic, and shows what you want to know. It definitely poses as a worthy replacement to push notifications. </p>
<p> Download DataFlow Manager from the App store for free. </p>
<p> That’s about it. Do you know about some other, maybe more convenient way of getting that data warning? If so, please don’t hesitate to let us know in the comments below. </p>
<p> 1 COMMENT </p>
<p> Love how we can set alerts and data cutoffs on our Samsung Galaxy 9plus on Android. Shame that Apple does not offer this feature for our iPhone 11. But your app + widget suggestion is a great work-around solution. Thanks for the great tip! </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/settings-search-bar-disappeared-ios-12" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844078" filename="settings-search-bar-disappeared-ios-12">
<p> Fix: Settings search bar disappeared in iOS 12 </p>
<p> iOS 12 is finally here. And it seems users have never been so excited about a major update that brings so little in terms of features, as that’s the case here. But for a good reason, because iOS 12 brings a major performance boost, and people would rather have a functioning phone, than some fancy new feature. </p>
<p> Even though iOS 12 significantly improves the performance of all the supported iPhones, we found a couple of early reports on possible issues the new iOS version brings. The first problem I stumbled upon on Apple’s support forum is ‘a glitch’ that apparently makes the search bar disappear from the Settings. </p>
<p> There are reports about this problem in previous iOS versions, so it doesn’t mean it’s exclusively caused by the new update. Anyway, if you encountered this problem upon installing iOS 12, there are a couple of things you can try to resolve it. </p>
<p> So, if the search bar disappeared from the Settings in your brand new iOS 12, follow some of these workarounds: </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Update the OS </p>
<p> It’s possible that something went wrong with installing the update. In that case, your best bet is to wait for a new update to arrive. Because if this issue becomes widespread, Apple will surely release a patch. So, just keep your phone up to date, and the problem may get fixed by itself. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear apps cache </p>
<p> Done users also suggest that it’s the piled up app cache that actually disrupts the settings. To eliminate this possibility, go and clear the apps cache data on your phone. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reset All Settings </p>
<p> And now, perhaps the solution that will be the most effective. As a matter of fact, most users who encountered this issue in the previous versions of iOS claim resetting the settings actually resolve the missing search bar issue. So, you might give it a try, as well. </p>
<p> But keep in mind, this will reset all your settings, so you’ll have to adjust everything from the start. But if that doesn’t bother you, feel free to proceed. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to General > Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset All Settings. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Factory reset the phone </p>
<p> And finally, instead of resetting the settings, you can reset the whole phone. Normally, I would advise against this workaround, because it will reset your phone to the factory state. But if the missing search bar really annoys you that much, you can try this. Just remembered to back up all your data to iCloud. </p>
<p> Here’s how to perform the factory reset in iOS 12: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Select Erase All Content and Settings. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and start the process (later on, you can choose Restore from the iCloud Backup feature). </p>
<p> That’s about it. If the forum reports are to be believed, resetting the settings will probably do. But who knows, maybe some other solution will resolve the problem. </p>
<p> If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, just write them down in the comments below. </p>
<p> 1 COMMENT </p>
<p> wow – it’s a pity that this issue still persists in iPadOS 13.4.1 (iOS13) </p>
<p> admittedly, it’s not reproducible. but given iOS was quite reliable in the iOS10 days, it didn’t make me happy this happened on day 4 of owning a new iPad Pro! </p>

<p> How to show Dropbox pictures in Google Photos </p>
<p> Even though OneDrive (Microsoft) and Google Drive (Google), due to the respective ecosystems, recently grew in popularity, the third-party cloud backup services are still standing strong. And, Dropbox is still the most popular out of this bunch. </p>
<p> And for all good reasons. It’s a great service, with competitive price, multi-platform integration, and versatile file-sharing options. However, to take the most of it, you’ll need the premium service and that comes at a price. Which provokes the question: is Dropbox a better choice for photo backups than Google Photos? </p>
<p> Photo backup: Google Photos vs Dropbox </p>
<p> Let’s start with Dropbox’s storage space. The free storage is rather limited and stands at 3 GB, which is hardly sufficient for photography aficionados. Since the service doesn’t offer any kind of automatic compression and considering the size of a typical photo, you’ll fill up that storage space quite fast. </p>
<p> On the other hand, that’s the exact file format which lets Google Drive (Google Photos) thrive. Namely, Google Photos offer two options when uploading your photos — High Quality and Original. </p>
<p> The High Quality option will compress your photos a bit to reduce their size. Visually, when compared with the original quality, compressed photos are slightly behind. And what you get in exchange is an unlimited storage. That’s a fair bargain in my honest opinion. </p>
<p> The Original option allows you to keep the original size of the uploaded photos, but you’ll slowly deplete the 15 GB of free storage space. If the resolution of your photos is 16 MP (or less), the differences are barely visible in comparison to the High-Quality option. The Original option arguably sits better with professional photography. </p>
<p> So, with all that said, Google Photos look like a much better option. And many will agree, as the photos-migration from Dropbox/OneDrive to Google Photos is quite common nowadays. </p>
<p> This all slowly leads to our subject for today. How to transfer the Dropbox photos to Google Photos and, hopefully, fast? Well, we made sure to provide the two ways (with both pros and cons), so you can choose your the preferred way. </p>
<p> Use desktop clients to perform a local transfer (reupload) </p>
<p> This option is the preferred one since it provides reliability and gives you more freedom. Drawbacks are obvious. In case you have tens of thousands of photos, storing them temporarily on your PC will take lots of space. In addition, prepare for a couple of days of uploading, based on a sheer number of photos and your bandwidth speed. </p>
<p> Here are the complete instructions: </p>
<p> Download and install both desktop apps. If you have the Dropbox client already installed and all photos are already stored on your PC, move to step 5. </p>
<p> Open the Dropbox client, sign in, and click Advanced Options. </p>
<p> Under the Selective Sync, click Change Settings. </p>
<p> Choose only folders with photos and sync them to your PC. Uncheck all other folders. </p>
<p> When all files are downloaded, open Google Backup and Sync client. </p>
<p> Sign in with your Google account. </p>
<p> Uncheck Desktop, Documents, and Pictures. Click “Choose folder” and select photo folders in Dropbox local folder. </p>
<p> Choose Photo quality and check the “Upload photos and videos to Google Photos” box. </p>
<p> Click Next and uncheck the “Sync My Drive to this computer” box. Then hit Start. </p>
<p> Wait until all photos are uploaded successfully. Prepare for a long wait as Google Photos automatically compress photos before storing them in the cloud drive. </p>
<p> Use MultiCloud to transfer your photos directly </p>
<p> This is a valid alternative to download/re-upload routine from the first option. However, we’ve tested it only on a limited number of photos, so we can’t claim that MultiCloud is actually faster than the aforementioned routine. Another thing in question is privacy and data infringement, but based on the service reviews, we don’t have any reasons to believe so. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to transfer your photos from Dropbox to Google Drive with the MultiCloud: </p>
<p> Install the Dropbox to Google Drive Chrome extension. You can open it from the Taskbar in the top-right corner in Chrome. </p>
<p> Create a new account and confirm it with the email confirmation link. </p>
<p> Sign in with the Google Drive account and grant MultiDrive permission to access it. </p>
<p> Now, click Add Clouds and choose Dropbox. </p>
<p> Sign in and grant MultiDrive access to Dropbox, as well. </p>
<p> Now, in the upper bar, select Dropbox and check only folders with photos. </p>
<p> In the bottom bar, select Google Drive > Google Photos. </p>
<p> Click on the “Transfer Now” button and brace yourself — it’ll take some time. </p>
<p> Later on, you can navigate to Google Account Settings and Dropbox Settings on the web and remove all permissions you’ve granted to MultiDrive. Also, you can uninstall the extension if it’s served its purpose. </p>
<p> That’s it. We can only hope that in the future, Google will allow sharing files directly from third-party sources, which will make these operations much easier. Until then, try out the enlisted steps and don’t forget to share your experience in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/siri-connection-issues" parent_folder="web1" id="file17846889" filename="siri-connection-issues">
<p> Fix: Siri unable to connect to network on iPhone </p>
<p> Siri is, as you already know, a smart voice assistant for all iOS-powered devices past iPhone 4. Some folks find it quite helpful in everyday use, others, well, not so much. All in all, it grants you an opportunity to experiment and find the best and the most useful way to handle your device. </p>
<p> Moreover, necessary internet connection makes it hard to utilize the Siri’s full potential in some occasions. Additionally, there are severe issues like the one we are addressing today. Namely, some users had issues with connecting to the network that rendered Siri completely unusable. As you’re probably aware, Siri can’t function without the stable internet connection (either Wi-Fi or mobile data), so: no connection – no Siri. There are a few reasons for connection issues and we’ll address them in this article. </p>
<p> Check your router </p>
<p> First, let’s remove external factors from the equation. Your wireless router can cause connectivity issues that may lead to Siri-related network problems. Try out any connection-related apps to make sure your overall connection isn’t the culprit. If you’re unable to connect, you should complete standard troubleshoot steps. </p>
<p> Turn off/on your router. </p>
<p> Make sure wireless is enabled. </p>
<p> Verify cables are securely connected. </p>
<p> Restore router to factory settings. </p>
<p> However, if the problem is persistent, and Siri is unresponsive, move on to device-related workarounds below. </p>
<p> Perform hard restart </p>
<p> Hard reset is a simple but great workaround that’s quite effective against temporary glitches and bugs. Some users succeeded in resolving this Siri issue in these few steps: </p>
<p> Press and hold Sleep/Wake button and Home button for 20 seconds (until the device shuts down and you see the Apple logo). </p>
<p> Wait until the phone start up. This may take more than usual. </p>
<p> Test Siri. </p>
<p> Restart Siri </p>
<p> A most simple thing you can do when it comes to Apple’s assistant issues is to just toggle it on/off. That should address possible glitches and settle this matter. You can do that in just a few simple steps: </p>
<p> Give her some commands to find out is the problem resolved. </p>
<p> Disable/Enable Dictations </p>
<p> Dictation feature is great for short voice notes and memos. Additionally, if you are accustomed to advanced voice commands, you can use it with great results. However, this feature occasionally can cause a few issues with Siri. So, it’s worth to try resetting it and resolve a connection issue. </p>
<p> If the problem is persistent, try additional steps. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings </p>
<p> Occasionally, your Siri connection issues may be related to overall connection problems. The majority of connection issues are easily addressed by resetting network settings. Have in mind that this will delete all your established connections so you’ll need to set up those later. </p>
<p> Choose ‘Reset Network Settings’. </p>
<p> Reconnect with known Wi-Fi source and try commanding Siri again. </p>
<p> Update iOS </p>
<p> Updating your iOS to the latest version is a good way to resolve some minor issues. Moreover, some users reported this exact problem with Siri after an upgrade, so it goes both ways. You can either upgrade it or downgrade it – it depends on circumstances you’ve encountered. The ones with the post-upgrade issues with Siri can downgrade iOS to a second to last version (at the moment 10.2.1). Installation files and a whole step-by-step procedure can be found here. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you’re running the device without the latest updates, it’s strongly advised to download and install the latest iOS version. Most of the time you’ll be prompted with upgrade notification. However, it won’t cost you to check manually for updates from time to time. </p>
<p> Backup your device via iCloud or iTunes. </p>
<p> Make sure you have a stable Wi-Fi connection and the full battery before the process starts. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open General. </p>
<p> Tap Software Update. </p>
<p> If an update is available, tap Download and Install. </p>
<p> After the installation files are downloaded, you can choose to install them right away or postpone the installation. </p>
<p> Additionally, you can use iTunes client to download and install latest version. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if all compiled workarounds haven’t got you going, factory restore is the only viable solution. You can either use iCloud or iTunes to restore backed up data after the cleaning process is done. But before everything, don’t forget to backup your data. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to restore factory settings (via iCloud): </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Choose Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Erase all content and settings. </p>
<p> After the procedure is finished, make sure your battery is full and that you’re connected to stable Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> From the Apps & Data screen, tap Restore from iCloud Backup and sign in to iCloud. </p>
<p> Tap Choose backup and select the latest backup. </p>
<p> Once the device is restored, the Siri-related issue should be resolved. </p>
<p> In addition, you can restore factory settings with iTunes. </p>
<p> Download and install the latest version of iTunes app on your PC. </p>
<p> Remember to backup your device. </p>
<p> Select Restore. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and move on to restoring process. </p>
<p> After you’ve setup your device as new, try out Siri. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. If you have any alternative solutions, suggestions or questions, please share them with us in the comments. </p>

<p> Fix: Siri not working after update to iOS 10/10.1/10.2 </p>
<p> If someone told me back in the 90’s that we’ll have an intelligent personal assistant software built into our phones, I would probably laugh. Additionally, they might have said that we’ll be able to control it with voice commands and that it adapts to your needs. And I would take the road of skepticism and leave their company. Or just hit them with the indestructible Nokia 3310 I owned back then. </p>
<p> Nowadays, while I’m aware of my mistake, still sometimes can’t believe to all the possibilities we have with Siri or Cortana or OK Google. It just makes your life a bit easier and interactions a bit more interesting. </p>
<p> Today, we ‘ll try to find the fix for misfunctioning Siri after the iOS update to latest version. Many Apple costumers reported the variety of issues concerning Siri. Usually, Siri is not responding, or the Dictation option is not to the point. But, those are common issues. The ones that are newly presented are regarding Siri functioning with third-party apps. </p>
<p> That was recently implemented upgrade that lets you control your Whats Up or Facebook with Siri’s assistance. Of course, there are multiple solutions for the problem so will try and solve it. </p>
<p> How to resolve issues with Siri on iOS 10/10.1/10.2 </p>
<p> Turn Siri OFF/ON </p>
<p> Turn Dictation option ON/OFF </p>
<p> Tap Keyboards. </p>
<p> Toggle Dictation OFF and wait for a while. </p>
<p> Connect to the Wi-Fi instead of Mobile Data </p>
<p> Try using Siri solely on Wi-Fi connection since there is a possible glitch regarding 4G. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings </p>
<p> Choose General. </p>
<p> Tap Reset. </p>
<p> Select Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Reinstall third-party apps </p>
<p> We already mentioned newly implemented apps compatible with Siri. You should try to update them or, eventually, reinstall and give it a go. Maybe the problem lies within them. </p>
<p> Check your microphone </p>
<p> The easiest way to check your microphone is to use Voice Memo. If the voice is not recorded, the mic is out and you ‘ll need to get it fixed. If it does, then the problem is not connected with hardware. </p>
<p> Use your earbuds </p>
<p> Some users reported that Siri is functioning without any problems while using earbud microphone for the voice commands. You should try it out. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> iOS updates are often glitchy and have several problems that are not addressed for a while. It is a bit irresponsible approach since the users are paying a lot of money for a lackluster service. If you haven’t managed to make Siri work with our tips, all we can do is wait for a new update that fixes this issue. Are you having any other problems with latest iOS updates?

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/skype-android-unable-to-connect" parent_folder="web1" id="file17847776" filename="skype-android-unable-to-connect">
<p> Fix: Skype for Android won’t connect to the internet </p>
<p> To quote on Leo Tolstoy ”Instant messengers are all alike; every remodeled instant messenger tend to be like the others”. All jokes aside, Microsoft decided to refurbish the Skype app for handheld devices and now it looks like a hybrid of WhatsApp, Viber, and Snapchat. And just like those renowned apps, Skype tends to cover every possible aspect even remotely related to instant messaging. </p>
<p> Now, that’s not bad per se, new Skype is functional and easy to use. Even though many users aren’t satisfied with interface changes, it’s still a useful tool. However, like with so many other apps, the main function of the Skype, which is video calls, somewhat fell into the second plan. Moreover, some issues emerged after the Android update and the most common issue is, and you would probably guess, related to a connectivity. </p>
<p> Some users reported that they’re unable to connect to Skype and even send messages from their Android handsets. Not to mention the inability to seamlessly perform or receive a video call. For that purpose, we prepared some workarounds and tweaks that should help you resolve the problem and maintain the stable connection. You can find them below. </p>
<p> Meet the requirements </p>
<p> In order to use Skype 8, you’ll need to meet the certain requirements. Those requirements are not exactly demanding, but, in our modest opinion, instant messengers like Skype should be optimized for use even on the oldest devices. Just like the desktop version which basically demands calculator-like PC specs. Joke aside, these are the specs you’ll need to have in order to use all Skype 8 features on your Android handset: </p>
<p> Android OS 4.0.3 or higher. </p>
<p> ARMv7 processors are a must for video calling. Users with Armv6 processors can use messaging and VoIP calls, but it won’t support video calls. </p>
<p> 32MB of storage space. This tends to expand over time. </p>
<p> After you’re certain that your device meets the requirements, we can move on to additional steps in the list. </p>
<p> Check the device connection settings </p>
<p> Let’s refrain from throwing stones on Skype for the time being. Maybe it’s the overall instability of Wi-Fi or mobile data the main reason for the issue at hand. This might improve overall performance. So, check your connection with other connection-related apps, like Facebook, Viber or something similar, and, if everything works as intended, move on to next step on the list. </p>
<p> However, if something is wrong, you should follow the steps below and troubleshoot the connection on your device: </p>
<p> Use Wi-Fi instead of mobile data. Mobile Data network isn’t the most reliable way to use Skype. You can use it for instant messaging, but when it comes to video or voice calling, stable Wi-Fi connection is always a preferred way. </p>
<p> Shut down your router, wait for some time and turn it on again. </p>
<p> Forget Wi-Fi network and re-establish it again. </p>
<p> Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz. It lacks range, but it’s a more stable option. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition within boot recovery settings. </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate trough the menu. </p>
<p> Select Recovery mode with the single press of Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation point should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> Have in mind that the access procedure can vary on different Android devices. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> This will reset all network settings, including APN, wireless, and Bluetooth settings </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth since it can affect Wi-Fi or Mobile Data signal on some devices. </p>
<p> Disable other connection-dependant apps from working in the background. </p>
<p> Once you’ve managed to establish a proper connection, give Skype another shot. If the problem is still there, and negative reviews of Skype 8 turned out to be correct, move to other solutions on the list. </p>
<p> Update the Skype app </p>
<p> Even though it seems that they made a mistake with remodeled Skype app a.k.a Skype 8, frequent updates are always welcomed. Users expect resolution of most common problems that keep stacking up like worms after a rain. Now, with every new update, some problem is addressed, so, statistically, it’s a good chance that your connection problem will be resolved. If not with the current update, at least with some upcoming updates. </p>
<p> So, check for updates and we might overcome the above-mentioned connection problem: </p>
<p> Open the Play Store app. </p>
<p> Tap Menu. </p>
<p> Choose My Apps & Games. </p>
<p> Look up for the Skype – IM & Video Calls app in the Updates tab. </p>
<p> If the update is available, choose to update. </p>
<p> Restart your handset and look for changes. </p>
<p> Clear app’s cache </p>
<p> As you’re probably aware, apps store cache to speed up the loading process and save micro-settings. However, after some time, piles of the cache can and will affect the app’s performance. Don’t let the small size of the stored cache fool you into thinking that it can’t slow down the app or cause errors. So, it’s advised to clear cache from time to time, especially if some strange problem emerged. It’s worth a try and won’t cost you much. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to clear cache from the Skype app: </p>
<p> Open Apps (Applications). </p>
<p> Tap Skype and open Storage. </p>
<p> Clear Cache and Data. </p>
<p> Hopefully, that should relieve you of possible issues caused by cache infringement or corruption. If it wasn’t sufficient to resolve connection problems, and your nerves are getting thinner, there are some other things you can try. At least, before you send a ticket to customers support and ask for a subscription refund. </p>
<p> Reinstall Skype </p>
<p> The next obvious step is reinstallation. It might resolve the problem, but, if it’s to be believed to our present experiences – if the code is flawed, reinstallation won’t do you any good. Either way, it’s worth a shot and you won’t loose anything by doing so. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app </p>
<p> If even that step was in vain, the only remaining solution is to install APK with older version and hope for the best. It looks like large developers can’t get a hold of a good old saying ”If it’s not broke, don’t fix it”. Well, luckily, you can always downgrade. </p>
<p> Downgrade with APK </p>
<p> If that’s still not enough, and Skype 8 proved to be a nefarious band of misfortunate events and bad decisions made by Microsoft, you can use APK file to install the older app version. Of course, don’t forget to disable the auto-updates within the Play Store Settings. We don’t want to get Skype 8 again, do we? </p>
<p> Download the wanted version’s APK here on your PC. </p>
<p> Extract the file with WinRar or similar tool until you have the APK file. </p>
<p> Connect the Android device to the PC via USB and transfer the APK file to internal memory. </p>
<p> Uninstall the current version of the Skype app and restart your device. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Security, and enable Unknown sources. </p>
<p> Use a native file explorer or File Explorer to navigate to the folder where the APK file is stored. </p>
<p> Tap to install the APK with the older version. </p>
<p> After the process is finished, make sure not to install updates for the Skype app. </p>
<p> That should do it, folks. Moreover, if you have any questions or suggestions, make sure to tell us in the comments section. We’ll be glad to answer them and help you within our capabilities. Either way, thank you for reading and have a nice day. </p>

<p> Fix: Slow internet speeds on Android 11 </p>
<p> Android 11 is slowly coming to more and more devices, but with it, besides a few nifty features, comes a couple of issues, as well. Namely, users reported slow internet speeds on Android 11. Based on reports, it seems that Wi-Fi is noticeably slower on the latest Android iteration. </p>
<p> No worries because we have a few solutions you can use to resolve the issue at hand. </p>
<p> Why is my phone’s WiFi so slow? </p>
<p> 1. Inspect your Wi-Fi network </p>
<p> From the get-go, let’s start by inspecting your Wi-Fi network. For starters, reboot your router/modem and your handset. Now, connect your PC or any alternative device and check the network speeds there. </p>
<p> If the discrepancy is too high, and (for example) your notebook reaches 300MBs while your Android is hitting only 100MBs, we can conclude that there’s an evident issue with your phone. </p>
<p> Additionally, you can access your router settings and check for possible limitations. Don’t forget to update your router to the latest firmware version. </p>
<p> 2. Disable Bluetooth </p>
<p> There are reports about conflicts between Bluetooth with the Wi-Fi antenna that lead to either connectivity issues or substantial drops in Wi-Fi speeds. </p>
<p> So, run the network speed diagnostics and compare results with Bluetooth off and on. If this doesn’t solve the issues, make sure to move to the next step. </p>
<p> 3. Update the firmware </p>
<p> Based on reports, Android 11 users with slow Wi-Fi resolved the problem by updating the firmware on their devices. It seems that the issues were on the software side, however, we can’t say with certainty that this applies to every problematic device out there. </p>
<p> In order to update the firmware on your Android, follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System. </p>
<p> Select Advanced. </p>
<p> Tap System Update and check for updates. </p>
<p> 4. Reset Network settings </p>
<p> The next thing you can try is resetting your network settings. By doing so, you’ll lose all saved passwords, saved Bluetooth devices, and APN configurations. However, this is one of the most common solutions for a variety of network-related issues so it’s worth giving it a go. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reset Network Settings on your Android 11 device: </p>
<p> Select Advanced. </p>
<p> Choose Reset options. </p>
<p> 5. Switch between 2.4GHz and 5GHz </p>
<p> If there’s a chance to switch between 2.4GHz to 5GHz wireless frequency, we highly recommend it. Especially if you are in a crowded area. However, the vice-versa approach is also applicable if your router is not in your vicinity. </p>
<p> You can modify frequency on your router. Of course, if it supports 5GHz frequency to start with. </p>
<p> 6. Reset your device to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the aforementioned solutions worked for you, we can only suggest contacting your phone’s OEM and sending a bug report concerning the slow Wi-Fi speed on Android 11. Alternatively, you can reset your device to factory settings and start from scratch. Just don’t forget to back up your data to Google Drive or to your PC before doing so. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reset your Android 11 device to factory settings: </p>
<p> Navigate again to Settings > System > Advanced and select Reset options. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data. </p>
<p> And, on that note, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to tell us about your experience with slow Wi-Fi on Android 11 or share alternative solutions so we can add them to the list. The comments section is right below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/snapchat-not-sending-videos" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844097" filename="snapchat-not-sending-videos">
<p> Fix: Snapchat not sending videos </p>
<p> Snapchat made a huge breakthrough and redefined the way users around the globe share images, videos, or messages on mobile devices. And if Snapchat is not sending videos for any reason, we can safely conclude that there’s not much use of it. Which is, seemingly, the case for many users. </p>
<p> We read through user reports and made sure to provide you with a few applicable solutions for the problem at hand. Check them out below. </p>
<p> Why are my Snapchat videos not sending? </p>
<p> Snapchat is a specific social media app and it is slowly losing traction it once had. Frequent issues are one of the reasons for this. If your Snapchat is not sending videos, it’s usually due to pilled up cache or connection issues. </p>
<p> You should firstly ensure that the user you are trying to send videos too has you on your friend’s list. After that, reboot your device and try again. If the problem persists, check the steps below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear app’s cache and data </p>
<p> The first thing to do is to clear the cache and data from the Snapchat app. Due to pilled up cache, certain third-party apps tend to get slow or even some functions suddenly stop working. </p>
<p> The pilled up data will include saved Snaps, so make sure to back them up before clearing everything. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear the data and cache from Snapchat: </p>
<p> Choose Apps (Apps Manager or Manage apps). </p>
<p> Locate and open Snapchat from the Apps list. </p>
<p> Reboot your device and then sign in with your credentials. </p>
<p> If Snapchat is still not sending videos, move to the next step. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Update Snapchat </p>
<p> We all can agree that the Snapchat app for Android (especially in comparison to the iOS version) was and still is an underwhelming experience. Post-update bugs emerge with almost every new update and fixes are scarce. </p>
<p> However, that still doesn’t mean that you should keep your apps out of date. By default, updates are automatically administered or you can check for updates in the Play Store. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can download an older functioning APK. Some users managed to address the problem by downgrading to an older version. Just search for Snapchat APK on your device, select an older public version and install it. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reinstall Snapchat </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can reinstall the app and start from scratch. Just don’t forget to back up downloaded media files and to reboot your device after you reinstall the app. If the first solution did not work, we can hardly guarantee reinstallation will make a difference. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, give it a go and see for yourself: </p>
<p> Open Play Store and search for Snapchat. </p>
<p> Tap Uninstall. </p>
<p> Install Snapchat again and reboot your handset. </p>
<p> Sign in with your credentials and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Check the connection </p>
<p> Another kind of obvious reason why Snapchat is not sending videos is an inadequate connection. Ensure that you are connected to Wi-Fi or mobile data. If your connection is unstable, chances are videos won’t be able to send. </p>
<p> Here are some tips for you to troubleshoot connection issues: </p>
<p> Disable and re-enable Wi-Fi. </p>
<p> Restart your device and router/modem. </p>
<p> Enable Airplane mode and disable it after a minute or so. </p>
<p> Reset the Network settings. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Check the permissions </p>
<p> Usually, all necessary permissions are asked for once you start the app. However, there’s a slight chance that you denied the Storage permission which is required in order to store and send videos on Snapchat. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to check and enable permissions on Snapchat: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > App Manager or Manage Apps > Snapchat. </p>
<p> Select Permissions. </p>
<p> Grant Storage permission to Snapchat. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Confirm Snapchat status and send a support ticket </p>
<p> Finally, if Snapchat is still not sending videos, we suggest checking the server status. Even though it rarely happens, Snapchat servers might be down for an undefined period. You can check the status on the Down Detector, here, or on Snapchat’s official Twitter handle, here. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can contact support either on the aforementioned Twitter handle or on the official Support page, here. Although, user comments state that the support tends to neglect their reports, it’s worth a try. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thanks for reading and, in case you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/split-screen-multitasking-android-10" parent_folder="web1" id="file17842756" filename="split-screen-multitasking-android-10">
<p> How to enable split-screen multitasking on Android 10 </p>
<p> Android 10 changes the way we use and navigate our smartphones. Of course, the biggest change compared to previous Android versions is the revamped navigation system that now completely relies on gestures, instead of buttons. </p>
<p> However, the navigation system is not the only functionality that Android 10 changes. Google also changed the way we multitask in Android. In previous versions of the OS, you had to have multiple apps already open in the background to access split-screen. Then you’d drag-and-drop two apps to the top and bottom of your screen, and voila, you’re multitasking. </p>
<p> In Android 10, however, swiping will close the app instead of bringing it to split-screen. That’s why some users are left confused with the new system. But you shouldn’t worry, because using split-screen in Android 10 is as simple as it’s ever been. It’s just done differently. </p>
<p> How to multitask on Android 10 </p>
<p> Here’s how to use two apps at the same time on Android 10: </p>
<p> Launch the app you want to use in the split-screen mode. </p>
<p> Enter the recent apps screen. This varies depending on the navigation system you’re using (swipe up the home bar if using gestures, swipe up from the pill if using two-button navigation, of tap the recents (square) button if using three-button navigation. </p>
<p> Find the app you want to use in the split-screen mode. </p>
<p> Tap the three-dot menu or the app icon, depending on your device. </p>
<p> Choose Split screen. </p>
<p> Now, choose another app from the app switcher and tap it. </p>
<p> Both apps will now be in the split-screen mode and you’ll be able to multitask. </p>
<p> I should also mention that you can choose the portion of the screen each app will use in the split-screen mode. However, this might not work properly in the landscape mode, so you should only do this while in the portrait mode. </p>
<p> How to resize apps in the split-screen mode </p>
<p> Here’s how to resize apps while in the multitasking mode on Android 10: </p>
<p> Make sure both apps are still in the multitasking mode. </p>
<p> Tap and hold the middle black bar and move it app or down to increase the portion of the screen one app takes. </p>
<p> If you move the bar to the top, it will open the app on the bottom in full screen and thus close the split-screen mode. Move the bar to the bottom, and the opposite will happen. </p>
<p> That’s about it. If you have any additional questions, feel free to write them down in the comments below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/spotify-ios-bugs" parent_folder="web1" id="file17844923" filename="spotify-ios-bugs">
<p> Most common Spotify issues in iOS, and how to solve them </p>
<p> Spotify quickly emerged as a go-to app for music streaming. Besides its brilliant design and premium service, users around the world can enjoy streaming their favorite music remotely to speakers or TV. There’s such a variety of available songs that it’s quite a task to find unavailable tracks. More than 30 million songs and 2 billion playlists are available at the moment. </p>
<p> However, even though the Spotify iOS app is certainly not bad, it’s not without issues. iPhone and iPad users around the world reported a hefty number of problems, bugs, and glitches. If you’re having any issues with Spotify, look no further. We enlisted the most common issues and provided adequate solutions below. </p>
<p> I can’t log in/wrong password </p>
<p> The login issues are common with all similar applications, especially the ones that are dependent on the internet connection. There are a few solutions you can use to resolve this issue and get back to your favorite music. </p>
<p> If you’re unable to log in due to wrong password or email, you can try and reset the password. It doesn’t matter if you’re 100% positive that the password is on point. It seems that the problem is related to Facebook and standard log in conflict. So, without further ado, follow these instructions to reset the password: </p>
<p> Enter your email address that you have used to create an account. Additionally, you can use your username, as well. </p>
<p> Now, navigate to your email inbox and follow the link in order to create a brand new password. </p>
<p> Try logging in again. </p>
<p> Have in mind that this is only for folks that haven’t used Facebook to create Spotify account. </p>
<p> Additionally, you should check the server status. If the Spotify server is down, there’s a chance that you won’t be able to log in. You can check the server status on official Twitter feed, here. </p>
<p> Streaming stutters or stops after one song </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you’re able to log in but you wish you hadn’t because of stream stutters or inexplicable stops, we’re here for you. This issue can easily be resolved with one of the following steps. </p>
<p> First, let’s check the connection. This steps should do you right: </p>
<p> Restart your wireless router and make sure everything is properly connected. </p>
<p> Restart the device. </p>
<p> Reset router to factory settings. </p>
<p> Enable UPnP in router settings. </p>
<p> Another thing that proved as a worthy solution in many cases is related to streaming quality. Namely, some users reported that, after they changed the stream quality, the playback issues were gone. Follow these instructions to change stream quality. </p>
<p> Open Spotify app. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Stream. </p>
<p> Change from High Quality to Low Bandwidth or vice versa. </p>
<p> Familly Account issues </p>
<p> As you probably already know, with Family Premium, you can use up to 6 accounts for quite a small fee. If you ask us, it’s a bargain, but, of course, if everything works as intended. </p>
<p> Some users reported various issues after purchasing Premium Family plan, with the majority related to inviting codes. To relieve you of this annoyance follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Make sure every member have a valid account. </p>
<p> Members should use email/password instead of Facebook to create an account. </p>
<p> Each member should have free account instead of the premium one. </p>
<p> Make sure that the Family Admin sends invites to a proper email address. </p>
<p> If you have any additional issues, make sure to send a ticket to Spotify Cares team. They’re available on Facebook and Twitter. </p>
<p> No Sound issues </p>
<p> Premium music-streaming app without a sound isn’t exactly appealing. Even though this isn’t a frequent issue, it does happen from time to time. And most of the time it’s related to your settings. </p>
<p> These are the actions you should take to troubleshoot the no-sound issue on your iOS: </p>
<p> Make sure the Volume is up. Use side Volume buttons or navigate to Settings > Sound & notification and increase Spotify volume. </p>
<p> Unpair your Bluetooth headphones and pair them again. </p>
<p> Tap Apple Store app. </p>
<p> Tap Updates. </p>
<p> I accidentally deleted playlist (how to retrieve deleted playlist) </p>
<p> This isn’t exactly an issue but many folks had the misfortune to accidentally delete their favorite playlists. Since we’re well aware that the creation of a new playlist can take some time, the recovery is a much better solution. You can easily recover deleted playlists in no more than a few minutes. And this is the way: </p>
<p> Log in to your account at Spotify.com. </p>
<p> Open Recover playlists. </p>
<p> Click on Restore for the playlist you accidently deleted. </p>
<p> The recovered playlist should be now at the bottom of your Playlists under the Spotify iOS app. </p>
<p> I can’t share the music on a social network (sign out of network and sign in again) </p>
<p> One of the best roles of streaming apps is that you can share your favorite music with your friends on Facebook. That way you can show your music interests or even spam the Timeline like there’s no tomorrow. However, it seems that some users have issues with sharing features. To be more precise, according to them, they received an error that says that the Facebook account is linked to another Spotify account. </p>
<p> What you can do to resolve this issue is to remove Spotify from Facebook and reestablish it again. You can do that this way: </p>
<p> Log in to your Facebook and head to Settings. </p>
<p> Open Apps. </p>
<p> Click ‘X’ next to the Spotify app to disable it. </p>
<p> Now, open the Spotify app and reconnect with the Facebook. </p>
<p> In case you’ve changed your Facebook password, make sure to log out and log in again in the app. That should resolve your issues. </p>
<p> Offline issues </p>
<p> In our opinion, the essential premium feature of Spotify is a possibility to listen to your favorite music while on the move and without the stable Wi-Fi connection. However, there are certain boundaries you have within the Offline mode. </p>
<p> One premium Spotify account covers only 3 devices. </p>
<p> You can download only certain tracks. </p>
<p> You can obtain only 3333 songs for offline listening. </p>
<p> If you haven’t used the app for more than 30 days, the offline content will be removed. </p>
<p> You’ll need a lot of internal memory to save the files. </p>
<p> Additionally, if Spotify isn’t working properly in the offline mode, you should: </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Log out and log in again on the Spotify app. </p>
<p> Tap Purchased. </p>
<p> Choose Not on this iPhone/iPad </p>
<p> Remote streaming issues </p>
<p> As we already stated at the start of this article, remote streaming is the go-to feature for us. Just connect you iPhone/iPad to speakers and voila, you can enjoy the high-quality tunes in a much better manner. And you can do that with cars, smart TV or any other eligible device. However, not all device support Spotify Connect. The list of those devices can be found here. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you have an eligible device that supports Spotify Connect and the issues are still there make sure to: </p>
<p> Update your Spotify app and the firmware of smart device you’re trying to connect to. </p>
<p> Restart your iPhone/iPad and the pairing device. </p>
<p> Restart your Wi-Fi router. </p>
<p> Wrap up </p>
<p> In case you have additional issues, you can always send a ticket to Spotify team or share your problem on support community forum. </p>
<p> Additionally, you can place your suggestions or subject-related questions in the comments section below. We’ll do our best to help you. </p>

<p> Fix: Spotify lock screen media controls not working </p>
<p> Spotify is, for more than a few reasons, the most popular music streaming service in the world, especially on handheld devices run by iOS and Android. However, some Android users have had a hard time using media controls on the lock screen recently. More than a few Samsung Galaxy S10 users reported that Spotify Lock screen media controls are not working on their devices. </p>
<p> We made sure to search for applicable solutions and provide them below. </p>
<p> Spotify lock screen media controls not working on Samsung S10 </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check Lock Screen settings </p>
<p> The first thing you should do is to check Lock Screen settings and allow Spotify to create its own widget. In order to do so, you should disable the stock MusicFace widget. </p>
<p> Choose Lockscreen. </p>
<p> Open FaceWidgets. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear cache and data from Spotify </p>
<p> If the previous step hasn’t solved the problem, we suggest navigating to Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Spotify and clearing cache and data from the app. </p>
<p> That way, you’ll basically reset the app. Although, have in mind that clearing the local data will delete all downloaded music. </p>
<p> Choose Apps. </p>
<p> Open Spotify. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Disable Battery optimization </p>
<p> Some users suggested that the best solution for the unresponsive media commands on S10’s lock screen is to disable battery optimization for Spotify. This will allow Spotify Lock screen media controls that are not working to start working in the background. </p>
<p> If you are not sure how to do that, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps. </p>
<p> Open Spotify. </p>
<p> Select Battery optimization. </p>
<p> Disable Battery optimization for Spotify and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall Spotify </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps worked for you, make sure to reinstall the Spotify and start from scratch. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and, in case you have any questions or suggestions, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: “Spotify is trying to play” notification on Android </p>
<p> Although Spotify usually works great on Android handsets (or all other supported devices, for that matter), it’s not perfect or without bugs. The most recent bug we run into is the annoying Spotify is trying to play notification that’s persistent whenever users run Spotify on their handsets. </p>
<p> If you are affected by this issue, make sure to check the steps we provided below. </p>
<p> How do I stop Spotify from showing persistent notifications? </p>
<p> There are multiple reasons why this might happen, starting with connection issues, in-app bugs, or because you started and paused Spotify on a different device (smart speaker or desktop). </p>
<p> First, make sure to close Spotify on all devices (where that is possible) and give it a go again on your Android handset. If you are listening to your offline playlist, make sure Spotify has access to your Storage. If that doesn’t work, make sure to follow the steps below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear cache and data from Spotify </p>
<p> Let’s start by clearing cache and data from the Spotify app on your Android device. This should deal with the data corruption side of issues. However, be aware that this action will delete all your offline tracks. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear cache and data from Spotify: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps and then App Manager, All apps, or Manage apps. </p>
<p> Locate and open Spotify from the list of installed apps. </p>
<p> Select Storage. </p>
<p> Clear cache and then clear all data. </p>
<p> Reboot your device, log in to Spotify with your credentials, and check for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Terminate the app </p>
<p> Some users stated that this workaround helped them address the problem. Namely, some users navigated to App settings and terminated Spotify, which led to persistent notification disappearing. </p>
<p> Here’s how to terminate Spotify on Android: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps and then App Manager, All apps, or Manage apps. </p>
<p> Locate and open Spotify from the list of installed apps. </p>
<p> Tap Force Stop. </p>
<p> Open Spotify again and look whether Spotify is trying to play notification is still there. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Check the connection (for online mode) </p>
<p> In case you are trying to stream music instead of listening to downloaded tracks, make sure to check the connection. Spotify might notify you about it trying to play tracks if there’s a certain connectivity problem. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to check for possible network issues on your device: </p>
<p> Check connection in other apps (e.g. Chrome). If the network is unstable or slow, reboot your phone and router. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth temporarily. </p>
<p> Turn Airplane mode on and, after a few minutes, turn it off. </p>
<p> Disconnect and connect again to the network. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall Spotify </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can try and reinstall Spotify on your handset. This is not some revolutionary solution and you’ve probably tried it already. On the other hand, if you haven’t, give reinstallation a try. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reinstall Spotify on Android: </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Disable Notifications for Spotify </p>
<p> Yes, this isn’t a solution per se, but if you are fed up with that annoying Spotify is trying to play persistent notifications, just disable notifications for the app altogether. This is the best workaround we can suggest at this time. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to completely disable notifications for Spotify: </p>
<p> Open Settings again and navigate to Apps > All apps > Spotify. </p>
<p> Open Notifications. </p>
<p> Toggle off the notifications. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Downgrade the app via APK to an older version </p>
<p> Finally, if Spotify is trying to play notification is not big enough reason to completely disable notifications for the app and the previous steps failed to address the issue, we have one more thing to recommend. </p>
<p> There’s evidently a resurgence of this particular problem recently which makes us believe that the current public release is not working as intended. What you can do in that scenario is to download an older APK from the UpToDown.com (or any other similar website), and install it instead of the latest version. </p>
<p> Here’s how to download and install a Spotify APK with ease: </p>
<p> Download a Spotify version you want, just keep in mind that it shouldn’t be the latest version nor a version older than two months. </p>
<p> Run the APK. </p>
<p> Accept the installation of apps from third-party sources when prompted. </p>
<p> Install and check for improvements. </p>
<p> With that said, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and make sure to tell us if these steps helped you or not in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/sudden-shutdowns-moto-g3" parent_folder="web1" id="file17843093" filename="sudden-shutdowns-moto-g3">
<p> Fix: Moto G3 shutdowns suddenly </p>
<p> Since the introduction of its first generation back in 2014, Motorola Moto series proved as one of the most popular, affordable Android-powered handsets. With just everything that an average smartphone user needs, followed by slick design, quite clean stock Android, and solid all-around performance. The trend continued through third, fourth, fifth and, finally, the sixth generation. </p>
<p> However, just like some other renowned OEM’s, certain production series of Motorola Moto had issues that are hard to overlook. Have in mind that these are isolated cases, but that doesn’t make them less serious. Namely, more than few users had reported issues with sudden shutdowns on their Moto G3. </p>
<p> In order to help you, we enlisted a few workarounds. If you have had a hard time with your Moto G3 (3rd gen), check the steps below. </p>
<p> How to fix constant shutdowns on Moto G (3rd generation) </p>
<p> Update Firmware </p>
<p> If you’re positive that the hardware isn’t malfunctioning, a system update is a first step you should take when it comes to a software troubleshooting. Some users reported that the issue emerged immediately after the update. Luckily, due to frequent updates, some carriers and Motorola itself provided fix after some time. So, even though updates can break (or even brick) certain handsets, they can also (as they are supposed to do) repair emerging issues. Either way, records say that the best performance is noticed after updating to Android 6.0 Marshmallow. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open About phone. </p>
<p> Tap System updates. </p>
<p> If an update is available, make sure to install it. </p>
<p> Restart in Safe Mode </p>
<p> Even though this is a rare occurrence, certain 3rd-party apps can be the cause of the problem at hand. Most of the time they cause performance drops, lags or similar issues. Nothing as drastic as sudden shutdown or restart. But, it’s software and sometimes and you can’t be a 100 per cent sure. For that purpose, we advise you to take a Safe mode as a diagnostic step. Instructions below will inform you how: </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button while tapping on-screen Power Off. </p>
<p> Once the Reboot to Safe mode pop-up appears, tap OK to restart your handset in Safe Mode. </p>
<p> To be sure that you managed to enter the Safe Mode, you should see the Safe Mode line in the bottom of the screen. </p>
<p> If the device isn’t resetting on its own, there’s a chance that some 3rd-party app is the problem. </p>
<p> After you reset again your device, make sure to uninstall recently installed apps. </p>
<p> However, if your Moto power off on its own while in the Safe Mode, move on to additional steps. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Another workaround that is applicable to similar issues is wiping out of cache partition. As you probably know, cache partition is part of internal storage that keeps temporary files that regulate system processes. If there’s a corruption of some kind within the cache partition, it can certainly affect your phone’s performance. You don’t need to worry about your data since this procedure doesn’t affect it. </p>
<p> Make sure your device’s battery is at least at 20 per cent. </p>
<p> Power Off your phone. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key + Power button. </p>
<p> Keep on holding the Volume Down key until the Boot Menu appears. </p>
<p> By using Volume keys (up and down), navigate through the menu until you reach Recovery mode. </p>
<p> Use the Power button to select Recovery Mode. </p>
<p> The phone should restart now and you should see the Android mascot with an exclamation mark. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and, while holding it, press Volume Up key once. </p>
<p> Release the Power button and you should see the Recovery Mode menu. </p>
<p> Again, use Volume keys to navigate through the menu until you reach Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Press the Power button once to confirm it. </p>
<p> If asked, confirm the action. </p>
<p> Your device will restart and you should be good to go. </p>
<p> If even this isn’t an adequate solution for the problem, we advise you to keep your calm and move to additional steps below. </p>
<p> Recalibrate battery </p>
<p> Some users pointed out the battery as the main suspect for sudden reboots. Now, there’s only so much you can do once the battery shows the signs of malfunction. Besides replacing it, obviously. However, things got strange for certain users who have had acquired new batteries and still experienced issues. </p>
<p> So, in that scenario (and we still can’t be sure), the problem lies in either malfunctioning hardware or the software that’s in charge of battery readings. There’s only so much one can do when it comes to hardware, but you can take a shot at battery recalibration. What is that? Well, occasionally, the battery and system are on the wrong terms due to false readings, By recalibrating the battery, you might resolve that problem. It’s not advised to do it too often (once per 6 months) but it’s worth a try. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to recalibrate battery on your Moto: </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and let it turn itself off. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a charger and, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your charger. </p>
<p> Turn your phone on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> In addition, we advise you to use either original charger or any charger that is rated at 500mA and 1.5A. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous steps helped you, the only remaining solution is factory reset. Most of the technicians will say that this won’t help and that’s this hardware fault. And, most of the time, they’ll be right. However, it’s worth a shot and, with it, you can finally be sure that the hardware is the problem. Don’t forget to backup your data before the procedure starts, since this will wipe out everything from the device storage. That includes an external SD, as well. </p>
<p> Tap Settings </p>
<p> Select Backup & reset </p>
<p> Tap Factory data reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset phone to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> After that, your phone will restart restored to factory values. If, after that, the problem is still present, you should contact service or carrier. Don’t forget to share with them all troubleshooting steps you took. </p>
<p> With that, we can wrap it up. In case you have any questions, suggestions or remarks, make sure to share them with us in the comments below. Have a nice day and thanks for reading. </p>

<p> Super Mario Run on Android: Known issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Super Mario Run is the first Nintendo game developed for non-Nintendo systems and it finally made its appearance for Android after being an iOS exclusive. The first reactions are mostly positive and it seems that the game is living up to the hype. </p>
<p> However, besides price ($9.99) and obligatory internet connection in order to play, players around the world run into (pun not intended) more than a few issues. Today, we prepared a list of known issues for this run platformer. </p>
<p> Super Mario Run issues on Android </p>
<p> Super Mario Run crashes on stock Android </p>
<p> We understand that users with rooted devices have a problem running the game due to security measures. However, no one can be sure what exactly is happening with stock devices. Until now, it seems that the game isn’t supporting certain models and OS versions for unapparent reasons. Some users reported that they were able to start the game on older devices with lower specs and older Android versions. And, at the same time, some of the lately presented flagships had a problem with getting past the welcome screen. </p>
<p> At the moment we don’t have a valid solution, but we advise you to wait for the game update that should address this issue. The game is still a novelty so let’s give Nintendo some time. </p>
<p> Super Mario Run crashes on rooted/bootloader/non-stock devices </p>
<p> On the other hand, Super Mario Run is, as expected, not available on non-stock Android variations. Nintendo’s security system called SafetyNet prevents playing on devices powered by non-official Android. There’s not an official approach to overcome those boundaries but, well, let’s just say, thanks to some resourceful users, there is a way. </p>
<p> Have in mind that this isn’t exactly law abiding procedure and that we don’t bear any responsibility for possible circumstances. </p>
<p> Players can’t log on Nintendo account </p>
<p> Some players who have managed to get past the welcome screen encountered an issue with re-linking Nintendo account. The only solution offered to date is the complete reinstallation of the game. However, you may as well try to clean game data and cache. Moreover, there is a single file in game installation folder that you may try and delete. And this is how. </p>
<p> Download some kind of file explorer from Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Navigate to — /data/data/com.nintendo.zara on your internal storage. </p>
<p> Delete deviceAccount:.xml file. </p>
<p> Start Super Mario Run and try to log to Nintendo Account. </p>
<p> Players can’t download Super Mario Run from Google Play Store </p>
<p> Other players haven’t been able to even obtain the game from Play Store. Your best bet is to log out/log in to your Google Account and try again. If the problem is persistent, you may download APK mirror version here. </p>
<p> Moreover, some users had a problem with User Agreement/Privacy Policy. The only solution is to log in into your Nintendo Account and accept the changes. After that, you should be able to play. </p>
<p> That should wrap it up. As we already stated, the game is still new and Nintendo promised a lot of new content, events and, hopefully, fixes. It’s the least one would expect. </p>
<p> Have you acquired Super Mario Run yet? What is your opinion on the game? </p>

<p> Super Mario Run issues: Players unable to open the game </p>
<p> Nintendo shook up the world when it released Super Mario Run for iOS. Despite the fact it’s just a few days old, Super Mario Run was already downloaded by millions of users worldwide. But when we cool ourselves down from the hype, it looks like the game is not so perfect, as it appears on the first look. </p>
<p> First of all, gamers are not so happy about paying $10 for the full game. But even those who didn’t mind the price, and bought the game have their own fair share of issues. </p>
<p> Users unable to open Super Mario Run </p>
<p> A couple of users complained on the forums all over the internet that even though their phones are compatible with Super Mario Run, they’re not able to run the game for some reason. Here’s what one user said on Nintendo’s forums: </p>
<p> “hello, my question is : Why won’t The game open for me? I try and open it on my iPhone and it just closes right after. Can you please help me? “ </p>
<p> Apparently, he’s not the only one experiencing issues with the game. A few more users on the same forum complained about the same problem. Compatibility is not the problem here, because all these users have phones compatible with the game. </p>
<p> But just as a reminder, here are the system requirements for Super Mario Run: </p>
<p> ‘This game is compatible with the iPad Pro, the iPad Air, the 4th generation iPad, iPad mini 2 devices and up, the 6th generation iPod Touch, and iPhone 5 devices and up.” </p>
<p> So, if your iOS device doesn’t fall into this category, don’t bother buying the game, because it won’t work for you. </p>
<p> Currently, there are no known solutions for this problem. As soon as the solution appears, we’re going to make sure to let you know about it. </p>
<p> Have you bought Super Mario Run yet? How does the game work for you? Let us know in the comments below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/s-voice-issues-samsung-galaxy-s7" parent_folder="web1" id="file17843109" filename="s-voice-issues-samsung-galaxy-s7">
<p> Fix: S Voice call contact issues on Samsung Galaxy S7 </p>
<p> Samsung is a leading developer and manufacturer of smartphones for a good reason. They are known for innovations and one of those was S Voice, a personal voice assistant that cleared the path for long-awaited Bixby. S Voice is one of the firstly introduced exclusive smart assistants, and it’s still an amazing trait that makes already great phones even better. </p>
<p> However, just as same as others, S Voice suffers from occasional issues and bugs that sometimes render it completely unusable. The list of issues is long but we made sure to mention some: </p>
<p> S Voice can’t respond to a command. It keeps listening but to no avail. </p>
<p> S Voice can’t reach contacts you requested it to call. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we conducted a thorough research in order to bring you a few possible workarounds for your problem with Samsung’s smart assistant. If you’ve experienced these or similar issues, make sure to check the list below. Hopefully, at least one should help you resolve the problem at hand. </p>
<p> Reset your S7 and disable/re-enable S Voice </p>
<p> The first step you should take is a simple restart. It might seem too obvious, but it helped more times than not. In addition, make sure to disable and enable again the S Voice feature. It’s not unusual for Samsung’s built-in apps to malfunction, so this cycle should resolve possible infringement with some other third-party app or OK Google itself. </p>
<p> Double tap the Home button to access S Voice. </p>
<p> Open 3-dot menu. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Under Wake-up, uncheck the box beside ”Open via the Home Key”. </p>
<p> Open Application manager. </p>
<p> Navigate to S Voice app. </p>
<p> Tap Force Stop. </p>
<p> If the problem is still there, make sure to continue with troubleshooting steps below. </p>
<p> Update the app </p>
<p> For many users, including me, Nougat update, besides multiple improvements, brought the plethora of issues. And S Voice was affected, too. Luckily, some of the latest updates addressed reported errors, so it should be better optimized for the latest OS edition. So, navigate to Play Store and update your S Voice app. </p>
<p> This a well-known procedure but it won’t hurt to repeat it below: </p>
<p> Open the 3-stripe menu. </p>
<p> Open My apps & games. </p>
<p> Enable S Voice ”Voice wake-up” </p>
<p> If you’re using S Voice without contact with your device, you need to make sure to enable the Voice Wakeup feature. This enables you to give commands to your S7 without unlocking it once it auto-locks itself. Follow these steps to enable the ”Voice Wake-up” feature and look for changes in assistants behavior: </p>
<p> Open the S Voice app. </p>
<p> Tap the 3-stripes menu and open Settings. </p>
<p> Toggle ON ”Voice Wake-up”. </p>
<p> Exit and try to issue a command to your handset. </p>
<p> Copy contacts to S7 phonebook </p>
<p> Many users use cloud services to backup their contact and as the main phone book. However, some users reported that S Voice can’t access contacts if they’re not present on default Samsung phone book. It seems awkward, but it actually makes sense. So, because of that, it’s recommended to copy your contacts to the built-in Samsung app and try again. </p>
<p> In order to perform that action, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Open Contacts. </p>
<p> Tap the 3-dot menu and open Organize contacts. </p>
<p> Tap Copy contacts. </p>
<p> Select Google or any other cloud backup you originally use. </p>
<p> Mark all contacts and transfer them to Phone memory. </p>
<p> Restart your S7. </p>
<p> Try using S Voice for hands-free calls again. It should recognize contacts. </p>
<p> Re-sync S Voice app </p>
<p> Besides the ”soft reset” we mentioned below, you can completely clear S Voice data and let it re-sync again. That’s kind of analogous to hard reset. Additionally, you can clear the complete app data within the App manager. Either way, this should allow you to start from a scratch and, hopefully, resolve the issues at hand. Have in mind that you’ll need to set preferences again after that. </p>
<p> To clear preferences and re-sync S Voice, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Change language to English </p>
<p> Some users reported improvement of S Voice performance once they changed the language to English (US). We can’t be sure why exactly that’s the case, but it’s worth a shot. It might be problematic if you’re not an English speaker for advanced commands, but it should function well with the simple ones. </p>
<p> If you’re not sure how to do it, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Tap the 3-dot menu and open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Language. </p>
<p> Select English (US) from the list. </p>
<p> That proved helpful for some users, so it might be just enough for you. </p>
<p> Disable OK Google </p>
<p> Besides S Voice smart voice assistant, Samsung users can use default Android app called OK Google. Now, in theory, both applications should work together in a seamless manner. But, due to similarity, sometimes one can negatively affect the other and, consequently, cause failures. Basically, if the problem is repetitive, you should choose one or another. Some users use Samsung Car and that feature only functions with native S Voice. </p>
<p> If you’re keen to use S Voice rather than OK Google, at least in certain situations, you can disable OK Google. For that purpose, follow the steps below and disable OK Google. </p>
<p> Open the Google app. </p>
<p> Tap the 3-stripe menu and open Settings. </p>
<p> Open Voice. </p>
<p> Disable OK Google detection and confirm changes. </p>
<p> Use OK Google instead of S Voice </p>
<p> At the end, even though it comes with some exclusive, specific features, S Voice isn’t exactly on par with OK Google. With the latest updates to Google’s smart assistance, most of the Android users are enjoying in feature-rich native voice assistant. This isn’t a solution per se, but if you’re unable to make the S Voice work, it’s an obvious choice. </p>
<p> It’s hard to give up on all the options a smart assistant offers, so if you are unable to use Samsung’s S Voice, OK Google should be enough. For that purpose, you can completely disable the S Voice feature. </p>
<p> Open Application manager. </p>
<p> Navigate to S Voice app. </p>
<p> Tap Disable. </p>
<p> Perform a factory reset </p>
<p> Finally, if nothing works, and you can say with certainty that the system update is the main culprit, you should restore your device to factory settings and give another try. All of us know how much trouble Nougat brought for some users, so maybe this is the final solution we’re looking forward to. </p>
<p> Tap Backup & Restore. </p>
<p> Open Factory Data Reset. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and insert your passcode or PIN. </p>
<p> That should do it. If you have any questions or suggestions, we look forward to hearing from you. Have a good day and thank you for reading. We hope it helped you. </p>

<p> Fix: Telegram issues in Android </p>
<p> There are so many instant messengers nowadays that share similar traits and users are not sure which to use. Telegram is one of those that are slowly emerging as a go-to option for users that put privacy and multi-platform usability above everything else. </p>
<p> The Telegram instant messenger is stable and reliable, but there are some issues that can affect it from time to time. For that purpose, we enlisted the most common issues with workarounds. In case you’ve experienced something unusual, make sure to check the list below. In addition, the Telegram developers are always open to help. So, if you’re unable to resolve the issue with the presented workarounds, you can contact them here. </p>
<p> Can’t install Telegram </p>
<p> This is an obvious problem. In order to use this nifty instant messenger, you’ll need to install it from the Play Store. However, some users have had issues with the installation in the first place. The first thing you should check is the system requirements. And these are the requirements you have to meet in order to install and run Telegram on your Android handset: </p>
<p> Multiple permissions that include: camera, contacts, location, microphone, phone, SMS, storage and others. </p>
<p> If you meet those requirements and grant permissions but you’re still unable to install the app, you should clear Play Store cache and try again. If the problem is persistent nonetheless, we advise you to try the APK file and install Telegram that way. These are the instructions you should follow in order to download and install the APK file: </p>
<p> Download the wanted version’s APK here to your PC. </p>
<p> Extract the file with WinRar or similar tool until you have the APK file. </p>
<p> Connect the Android device to the PC via USB and transfer the APK file to internal memory. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced Settings > Security, and enable Unknown sources. </p>
<p> Use a native file explorer or File Explorer to navigate to the folder where the APK file is stored. </p>
<p> Tap to install the APK file. </p>
<p> After the process is finished, you should be able to run Telegram. </p>
<p> Make sure to obtain the app from the trusted source. </p>
<p> Messages fail to deliver </p>
<p> Certain users reported that, no matter how many times they try, recipients can’t see their messages. This is a major issue since it completely deflates the usability of this usually great instant messenger. What you need to do when something like this occurs is to check further steps and look for changes. </p>
<p> Make sure that the message is sent in the first place. Check connection and look for the 2 check marks. </p>
<p> Confirm that the recipient hasn’t blocked you. </p>
<p> Something with notifications can be the issue. Maybe the check marks aren’t displaying properly even though the message is indeed delivered and read. </p>
<p> The Secret Chat function is device-related. If you (and your recipient) configured this feature on certain devices, they can be accessed only through that exact device. </p>
<p> Moreover, you can try to clear the cache and, eventually, reinstall the app, if the problem is persistent. </p>
<p> To clear the Telegram’s cache, follow the instructions below: </p>
<p> Open Telegram. </p>
<p> Choose Storage. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you’re in need for more drastic approach, this is how to reinstall Telegram: </p>
<p> Open the App drawer or App menu. </p>
<p> Tap and draw the Telegram shortcut to the top to uninstall it. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Choose Install. </p>
<p> Follow the in-app instructions to configure your Telegram settings. </p>
<p> This should relieve you of the issues. </p>
<p> Can’t import contacts </p>
<p> As you’re probably aware, most of the instant messengers (including Telegram) need your number in order to connect with the contacts. Basically, all folks in your contacts list that use the Telegram instant messenger, should be added to your in-app contacts after you connect your device. Sadly, it seems that there is a bug that blocks the import of individual contacts. There are some things that you can do in order to overcome this obstacle. </p>
<p> Stop the app or restart your device. Just open the Active Apps window and stop Telegram. </p>
<p> Change some letters in the troubled contact. In addition, if you use non-alphabetical symbols (that differ from standard English), try renaming them. Once the contact is imported, you can restore its original name. </p>
<p> Make sure that the permission is granted. Telegram needs permission to access your Contacts. To make sure that’s the case, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Permissions. </p>
<p> Tap Contacts. </p>
<p> Enable Telegram. </p>
<p> With that, you should be able to import all contacts. </p>
<p> Notification issues </p>
<p> The Telegram instant messenger has two ways to present you with the notifications. One is, obviously, Google Cloud Messaging notification service that is an Android built-in feature. The second and primary was is app-related and it depends on various phone settings. Namely, certain Android features on specific Android devices tend to block notifications in order to reduce the power consumption. That’s the main reason why you’re not seeing notifications on your device. </p>
<p> Accordingly, you have to make sure that the phone settings are optimized for background use of Telegram. These are some things you have to do in order to receive the notifications as intended. </p>
<p> Install the latest app version. Navigate to Play Store and check for updates. </p>
<p> Check in-app settings. Open Telegram > 3-line menu > Settings > Notifications and Sounds. Make sure that Message and Group alerts are enabled. </p>
<p> Enable Keep-Alive Service and Background Connection. Open Telegram > 3-line menu > Settings > Notifications and Sounds. Scroll down until you reach Other. There you can enable both Keep-Alive Service and Background Connection. </p>
<p> If your handset packs a system manager of some kind, there’s a chance that it reads Telegram as a power-intensive app and prevent notifications. Navigate to the manager app and set Telegram as a protected app or enable it to work in the background freely. </p>
<p> Enable Lock Screen notifications in the phone settings. </p>
<p> Telegram can’t connect </p>
<p> When it comes to connection, the problem is, at least most of the time, not app-related. Most of the time, the problem lies within your Wi-Fi configuration and/or its overall instability. There are some usual troubleshooting steps you can take in order to resolve this problem. Additionally, you can wait for some time since the cloud nature of Telegram means that sometimes the service might be down. </p>
<p> Reset your phone and wireless router. </p>
<p> ‘Forget’ your network and reconnect again. </p>
<p> Use 2.4Ghz signal instead of 5Ghz. With Nougat, the option to change Wi-Fi signal is removed so you’ll have to change your router configuration or use third-party programs and tweak settings. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Try switching from Wi-Fi to 3G and vice versa. </p>
<p> There’s a chance that crowded public networks won’t work as a home network. </p>
<p> Moreover, if other connection-dependent apps work great, you can try the following steps: </p>
<p> Force Stop app. </p>
<p> Clear apps cache and data. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app. </p>
<p> Disable proxy within the phone and app’s settings. </p>
<p> ”Last seen” isn’t displayed correctly </p>
<p> ”Last seen” feature is vastly spread on all known instant messengers. And Telegram isn’t excluded. However, some users reported issues with this function. Occasionally, they can’t see the ”Last seen” information or the time showing isn’t properly displayed. For that purpose, we advise you to follow the steps below and look for changes. </p>
<p> Restart your app. </p>
<p> Since Telegram uses automatically your time zone. If you’ve tweaked date and time on your own, there’s a chance that you’ll see different information. </p>
<p> Clear app cache. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app. </p>
<p> That should conclude our list. Telegram is an amazing and often over criticized without the proper reasons, so we advise all to at least give it a try. What are your thoughts on Telegram? Don’t forget to post your questions or suggestions in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: “Transaction cannot be completed” in Google Play Store </p>
<p> Buying apps, books, games, or music on Google Play Store is as simplified as possible with the 1-tap buy feature. You just choose what you want to purchase, tap on it and confirm the purchase. That’s it. Nonetheless, it’s far from flawless and has issues you might or might not experience. One of the common errors is “Transaction cannot be completed” in the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Make sure you have enough funds </p>
<p> The first and obvious step is to confirm that you indeed have enough funds for purchase to be made. Also, if you repeatedly enter wrong credentials while purchasing something, the Google Play might block the purchase for a short period. Also, confirm that the debit or credit card is eligible for Google Pay. </p>
<p> If you’re using a fingerprint instead of the password for Google Play purchases, make sure to try it out a couple of times or use the Google Account password instead. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear Google Play Store and Services cache </p>
<p> In Android, like in any other system, the dedicated apps store all kinds of data. Now, this is fine and it eliminates the need to configure everything every time you use it. Google Play Store and Google Play Services store your payment methods, so you can buy any app, game, album, or book, in a few taps. </p>
<p> However, the cached data tends to get corrupt, thus the payment might fail. That’s why we suggest resetting the cache for both aforementioned apps and looking for improvements. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps (Apps Manager). </p>
<p> Open the Google Play Store app and then Storage. </p>
<p> Open Google Play Services and open Storage and then Clear cache. </p>
<p> Restart your device and try making purchases again. </p>
<p> If the “Transaction cannot be completed” error reappears, make sure to continue through the list. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Remove and add Payment method again </p>
<p> If one payment method won’t work, you can, if available, add an alternate paying method. On the other hand, if you have only one card you can rely on, re-establishing the Payment method in Google Pay can help and clear the error. </p>
<p> Here’s what you’ll need to do: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Tap on the hamburger menu in the left top corner and open Account. </p>
<p> Choose Payment methods. </p>
<p> Remove the current payment method and restart your device. </p>
<p> Repeat the path and tap Add credit or debit card. </p>
<p> Enter your credentials again and try purchasing with that payment method again. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall the third-party app which bothers you </p>
<p> Finally, the last solution is reserved for the error appearing in the third-party app’s interface. Some apps offer premium services and features which can be bought in the app. The Google Pay is also utilized here, so the problem might be singled out to the app, instead of being a general issue. </p>
<p> When this happens, we recommend reinstalling the troublesome app and installing it again. After that, try upgrading to premium features again and look for changes. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reinstall the app with a few simple steps: </p>
<p> Open App drawer or App menu. </p>
<p> Tap-and-drag the app to the top and uninstall it. </p>
<p> Navigate to Play Store and install the app again. </p>
<p> Try making in-app purchases again and look for improvements. </p>
<p> That’s it. If you’re still unable to resolve the issue, we encourage you to post your problem to a dedicated forum thread or fill out the report on Google’s support center and get a call. Also, don’t forget to share alternative solutions or post questions in the comments section below. Your feedback is more than welcomed. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/twitter-android-cannot-create-account" parent_folder="web1" id="file17849425" filename="twitter-android-cannot-create-account">
<p> Fix: Twitter for Android cannot create a new account </p>
<p> When Twitter was introduced as a new big thing in the social networking niche till this day, the smartphones slowly took over. Nowadays, over 80 percent of all tweets are written and retweeted on Android or iOS. </p>
<p> However, regardless of the presence, apps for Android and iOS are not exactly the best. One of the rare errors concerns the creation of a new account. Namely, some users weren’t able to create a new account within the app. We have a few suggestions to help you deal with this. Check them out below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Reset app’s cache </p>
<p> Let’s start with the app itself. The Twitter app, like any other social network client for smartphones, tends to pile up a lot (and I mean A LOT) of cached data. These files, in theory, should reduce the loading time. By doing so, they allow you to see the multimedia content as fast as possible. </p>
<p> Of course, if you’ve just installed Twitter, this won’t do you any good. The cache is stored only after you log in. However, if you’ve used app successfully and now it won’t allow you to create a new Twitter account, follow the steps below to clear cache and data: </p>
<p> Tap Apps (Application Manager). </p>
<p> Open Twitter. </p>
<p> Choose Storage. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Reinstall the app </p>
<p> Reinstalling the app might help, as well. We still wouldn’t keep high hopes, as there’s a chance that the recent iteration of the Twitter app is suffering from some kind of a bug. However, since there’s only so much you can do in regards to similar issues, it won’t cost you a thing. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reinstall the Twitter app on Android: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > Twitter. </p>
<p> Uninstall the app. </p>
<p> Now, open Backup settings and disable Automatic restore. </p>
<p> Open Play Store and install Twitter. </p>
<p> Try creating an account again. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Download older iteration or try 3rd-party alternative </p>
<p> If the current release of Twitter for Android just fails to work as intended, rolling back to an older version should relieve you of the error. This can be done by downloading and installing an APK installation file from the APK mirror. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to try it out: </p>
<p> Uninstall Twitter. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced settings > Security. </p>
<p> Enable installation of non-official apps. </p>
<p> With a phone web browser, navigate to the APK Mirror website, here. </p>
<p> Browse available Twitter versions, choose an older iteration and download it to your device. </p>
<p> Install the APK and open Twitter. </p>
<p> You should be able to create a new Twitter account now. </p>
<p> Over time, Twitter for Android had various UI and feature changes and it always evoked divided reactions. Some users found the official app lackluster, while others shy away from the third-party wrappers. Either way, if you’re not keen to install an older version and want something new, there are some viable alternatives found on Play Store. </p>
<p> Here are some most used Twitter wrappers for Android: </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Create an account in a different way </p>
<p> Finally, if you’re certain the official app is your cup of tea, there’s still a way to create an account. Of course, we refer to Twitter for Web. You don’t need a PC to do so, and we made sure to provide you with all steps. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to create a Twitter account outside of the Twitter app: </p>
<p> Open Chrome (or any other browser) on your Android device. </p>
<p> Choose Sign up and create the account with the required credentials. </p>
<p> Make sure to open the confirmation email and confirm the Twitter account. </p>
<p> Now, you should be able to sign into the Twitter app for Android without any issues. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Hopefully, one of the steps will help you deal with the error. Tell us what are your thoughts on the official Twitter app and share additional solutions that helped you address this problem. You can do so in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/twitter-app-android-not-loading-pictures" parent_folder="web1" id="file17846100" filename="twitter-app-android-not-loading-pictures">
<p> Fix: Twitter app for Android not loading pictures </p>
<p> Twitter has elevated above the tweets a long time ago. The important piece of the platform are pictures, memes, and videos. This slowly become Twitter’s forte and that’s why we’re concerned with Android users reports which state that the photos on the Twitter app won’t load. </p>
<p> You can overcome this and we made sure to provide you with some commonly-used steps in the list below. </p>
<p> Solution 1: Clear app’s cache </p>
<p> From the get-go, let’s say that all social networking apps tend to pile up a lot of data. The developer’s intention is to speed up the loading time of images and video thumbnails and thus improve the user’s experience. </p>
<p> But, on many occasions, the abundance of stored cache data can slow down the app performance. Also, in this case, it might prevent loading new photos. That’s why cleaning the data stored internally on your device might help. </p>
<p> Tap Apps (Application Manager). </p>
<p> Open Twitter. </p>
<p> Solution 2: Reinstall the app </p>
<p> If the first step fails, the reinstallation is the next thing to try. We can’t be certain that will suffice, but it should give you a better insight into what started the picture-loading issue. We suggest clearing the app’s backed up data from the Google Drive before you install it again. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reinstall Twitter and start from a scratch: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > Twitter. </p>
<p> Uninstall the app. </p>
<p> Now, open Google Drive > Hamburger menu > Backups > Your device > Apps > App data. </p>
<p> Delete Twitter from the list. </p>
<p> Open Play Store and install Twitter. </p>
<p> Solution 3: Check the network permissions </p>
<p> If you have issues loading photos on Twitter only with mobile data, we encourage you to double check the network permissions. There’s a chance that your device won’t allow Twitter to access the Mobile Data. Of course, without even saying, you need to have at least tolerable network speed. </p>
<p> Here’s where to look at for network-related permissions: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Apps (Application manager). </p>
<p> Open Twitter. </p>
<p> Choose Data. </p>
<p> Make sure that both Wi-Fi and Mobile Data are allowed. </p>
<p> Solution 4: Install older iteration via APK </p>
<p> Finally, if the latest iteration of Twitter is just plain broken and it won’t work, you can always take a step back and download an earlier version. This can be done with the APK file. </p>
<p> We remind you that these apps, won’t get updates through Play Store, so you can stick with the functional version as long as you like. They’re perfectly safe to use, so we encourage you to use them when needed. </p>
<p> If you’re not sure how to download and install a Twitter APK on your handset, follow the steps we provided below: </p>
<p> Uninstall Twitter. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Advanced settings > Security. </p>
<p> Enable installation of non-official apps. </p>
<p> With a phone web browser, navigate to the APK Mirror website, here. </p>
<p> Browse available Twitter versions, choose an older iteration and download it to your device. </p>
<p> Install the APK and open Twitter. </p>
<p> After that, you should be able to see all the photos or beloved memes again in your Twitter feed. On the other hand, after some time, you can also try deleting the APK version and install the official version from the Store. Most of the bugs get addressed over time. </p>
<p> Don’t forget to tell us about the final results and whether the aforementioned instructions were helpful or not. The comments section is just below. </p>

<p> Tried step 1 and now Twitter won’t open. Maybe should have chosen Clear Cache instead of Clear Data??? </p>
<p> Clear data wipes out everything. If the stated purpose is to clear the cache press that. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/twitter-app-ios-not-loading-pictures-and-videos" parent_folder="web1" id="file17843895" filename="twitter-app-ios-not-loading-pictures-and-videos">
<p> Fix: Twitter app for iOS not loading pictures and videos </p>
<p> Long gone are the days when we used Twitter for writing meaningless tweets nobody cares about. Nowadays, Twitter is literally its slogan. It’s what’s happening. Millions of people use Twitter as their main source for consuming media. </p>
<p> We’re so accustomed to scrolling through the feed looking at tweets, videos, and pictures that when they fail to load, a mini panic attack strikes. And it appears that media fails to load more often than it should, especially in Twitter’s iOS app. </p>
<p> If you recently encountered this problem, and I assume you did, here are a few things you can try when Twitter for iOS fails to load a picture or a video. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Update the app </p>
<p> Although Twitter is a social network that functions independently from users, you still access it through the app. And apps are bug-prone. It’s quite possible that something got messed up inside the app’s code with the previous update, so developers now have to come up with a solution. </p>
<p> Since Twitter is huge, with a big development team, the issue should be acknowledged relatively fast. So, just keep checking for new updates, and hopefully one will solve the problem. </p>
<p> But while you’re waiting for a patch, there’s more you can try in the meantime. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Reboot and reset the phone </p>
<p> The oldest solution to any tech problem is also applicable here. Before doing something more drastic, like deleting the app, simply reboot your phone and see if the issue persists. A few users reported the reset resolved the problem, so there’s a chance. </p>
<p> How to reboot iPhone X/XS/XR and iPhone 8 </p>
<p> Quickly press and release the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Quickly press and release the Volume Down button. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Side button (sleep/wake, on/off). </p>
<p> Keep holding the Side button, even after the Shut down screen appears. </p>
<p> How to reboot and reset iPhone 7 </p>
<p> Press and hold the On/Off button on the right side. </p>
<p> Keep holding the On/Off button and press and hold the volume down button on the left side. </p>
<p> Hold both buttons as the screen turns off, and keep holding them until the screen turns back on and displays the Apple logo. </p>
<p> How to reboot older iPhones and iPads </p>
<p> Press and hold the On/Off button on the right side. </p>
<p> Keep holding the On/Off button and press and hold the Home button on the left side. </p>
<p> Hold both buttons as the screen turns off, and keep holding them until the screen turns back on and displays the Apple logo. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear the app cache </p>
<p> Unlike many other apps, Twitter actually allows you to clear the app cache and wasted storage! Kudos to the development team! </p>
<p> So, why not take advantage of this feature? Who knows, maybe it’ll allow pictures and videos to load again. Here’s how to clear the Twitter app cache: </p>
<p> Tap the Me button. </p>
<p> Tap Settings (the gear icon). </p>
<p> Go to Settings > Data Usage. </p>
<p> First, tap Media Storage. This allows you to clear the cache stacked in the general Twitter storage. </p>
<p> Now, tap Web Storage. These are ‘leftovers’ from web sites you visited in the Twitter app. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall the app </p>
<p> In case clearing the cache didn’t do the trick, you can always reinstall the app. Go on and delete the Twitter app, and install it from the App Store again. Maybe the freshly installed app will now show media. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Check the network connection </p>
<p> If there’s something wrong with your internet connection, you won’t be able to load the feed manually. So, take some time to investigate it. </p>
<p> In case there’s indeed something wrong with your connection, but you don’t know what to do, I suggest resetting the Network settings. Just keep in mind this will reset all your network settings, so you’ll have to log in to your WiFi networks again and maybe re-adjust all the Data settings. </p>
<p> Reconnect with known Wi-Fi source and try commanding Siri again. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope at least one of these solutions helped you resolve the problem with missing pictures and videos in the Twitter app for iOS. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, just let us know in the comments below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/twitter-widget-wont-update-android" parent_folder="web1" id="file17846790" filename="twitter-widget-wont-update-android">
<p> Fix: Twitter widget doesn’t update in Android </p>
<p> Widgets in Android were there from a start and they evolved largely thanks to all customization available. However, there are some issues, especially with the feed-based widgets like Twitter. Basically, its only purpose is to show you the live feed of the Twitter line on your home screen. And it seems that it won’t update for some users. </p>
<p> That’s where we come into play and provide some viable solutions. So, if it won’t update, give them a try and tell us how that worked for you in the comments below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Remove and set a widget again </p>
<p> Let’s start with the simplest of all solutions. Re-assigning the widget usually helps. Especially if you’ve updated the app or made certain changes. This is a simple procedure and, if you’ve already set a widget on the home screen, you’ll probably know how to set it again. </p>
<p> Either way, here are the exact steps: </p>
<p> Tap-and-drag the Twitter widget up and delete it. </p>
<p> Tap-and-hold on the home screen until the Customization menu appears. </p>
<p> Choose Widgets and navigate to Twitter. </p>
<p> Tap-and-drag the widget to a wanted home screen. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check the Background data settings </p>
<p> Now, the primary reason why anyone would put a widget on a screen is so it can have a real-time access to the latest news and weather feeds, and similar no-less-important information. And, in order to achieve this, they require the network connection. That’s the reason why you need to confirm that the Background data usage is enabled for the Twitter app. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps (Application Manager). </p>
<p> Select Twitter. </p>
<p> Allow Background data (Mobile data and Wi-Fi should be enabled by default). </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Clear app data </p>
<p> The widget is just an extension to an app. This means that the app is possibly the one to blame for the occurring issues with a widget. That’s the reason why we suggest clearing the stored data. This should address a few possible issues. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to clear the Twitter app data from your storage: </p>
<p> Choose Apps (Application Manager). </p>
<p> Select Twitter. </p>
<p> Tap Storage. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall the app </p>
<p> If the previous step fell short, you can give reinstallation a try. Since we’re talking about the social network, you can also delete all backed up files and get a clean slate start. This won’t delete anything but the in-app settings. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reinstall the Twitter app: </p>
<p> Open the app drawer and tap-and-drag the Twitter app to the top to uninstall it. </p>
<p> Open Google Drive and choose hamburger menu > Backups > Your device > App data. </p>
<p> Delete Twitter from the list. </p>
<p> Navigate to Play Store and download and install Twitter. </p>
<p> Establish the widget and look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Whitelist Twitter from lock-screen cleanup </p>
<p> If you’re using the built-in or a third-party app which controls the lock-screen cleanup, you need to whitelist the Twitter. Generally, these options don’t apply to widgets, but it’s well worth a try. Users who use Greenify whitelisted Twitter and the widget started working. </p>
<p> This option is easily found in every Phone Manager. Once you’ve allowed the Twitter app to work in the background, the feed should sync without any issues. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Disable the custom launcher </p>
<p> Finally, some users tried disabling the third-party launcher and the widget just self-repaired immediately. If you’re not willing to give up on all those advantages a usual custom launcher offers, at least make sure that the widget isn’t enabled on the default launcher. </p>
<p> Basically, this seems to be the cause of the problem. The only one of the launchers will do, and you need to choose which one. </p>
<p> On that note, we can safely conclude this article. If you’re aware of some alternative solutions or have a question or two to ask, feel free to do so in the comments section below. </p>

<p> UC Browser common issues, and how to fix them </p>
<p> Yeah, Chrome comes pre-installed and most people will stick with it for the mere fact it’s a first-party browser. However, if you scratch under the surface and take some time to find an alternative, Google Play Store is full of viable choices. One of the best being the UC Browser. However, the same applies to all, they’re flawed and they’ll cause you a headache from time to time. </p>
<p> The same goes for UC Browser which is quite popular and highly-rated alternative to mainstream browsers. It has its ups and downs, and we decided to focus on the latter and help you out resolving most common errors in UC Browser. </p>
<p> 1.UC Browser Download error </p>
<p> One of the common errors users frequently reported concerns the downloads. Seemingly, they’re abruptly stopped and users are sometimes able to continue downloading while other times they need to restart the download from a scratch. </p>
<p> We made sure to provide you with a few solutions for this problem, so make sure to check them out below: </p>
<p> Choose Apps & notifications. </p>
<p> Expand Advanced and choose Special app access. </p>
<p> Tap on the bottom navigation bar and open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Browsing Settings. </p>
<p> Disable Cloud Boost. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app. </p>
<p> Check Network settings (reboot your router and phone, delete network and re-establish it again, make sure you’re not using Mobile Data instead). </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps & notifications. </p>
<p> Open All apps. </p>
<p> Toggle On Background data and Unrestricted data usage. </p>
<p> 2.UC Browser crashes </p>
<p> Another common problem, especially on some previous iterations of UC Browser for Android, is the app crashing. The app would work just fine until it crashes so users had to hard close it and start it again. </p>
<p> This is, seemingly, not as present on the current stable version, but that’s not a rule of thumb. It can happen from time to time, and we surely want to avoid it. </p>
<p> If you’re unsure how to deal with the frequent crashes of the UC Browser, follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Install older iteration of UC Browser via the APK: </p>
<p> Uninstall UC Browser. </p>
<p> Open Chrome. </p>
<p> Navigate to the APKMirror and choose one of the available APKs. </p>
<p> Allow Chrome to install the APK from an unrecognized source. </p>
<p> Install the app and it should work much better than the troublesome latest version. </p>
<p> 3. Out of space error in UC Browser </p>
<p> Android users tend to use their smartphones as mobile computers, and that includes storing a lot of multimedia files. Due to the fact that media files are getting larger and storages are getting larger at a slower pace, there’s an obvious need for the external storage. However, that’s where the issues start. </p>
<p> Android is kinda limiting third-party apps access to the SD card. With that in mind, we can move to the next error which is the “Out of space” error in the UC Browser. If you’ve meddled with the browser settings, we suggest checking permissions and restoring the factory path for future downloads. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do to solve the issue at hand: </p>
<p> Change the default download location to internal memory: </p>
<p> Open UC Browser. </p>
<p> Tap on the bottom navigation bar and open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap on the Default Path and choose a different path. </p>
<p> Confirm changes and restart the browser. </p>
<p> Try downloading files again. </p>
<p> Make sure you have enough storage space. </p>
<p> Clear app’s cache and data. </p>
<p> Later on, if you need to have your downloads on the SD, you can transfer them manually. Just let them download on the download to the internal memory firstly. </p>
<p> 4.UC Browser not connecting to the internet </p>
<p> Now, what would you do with a browser without the internet connection? Not anything useful, obviously. And, like with any other mobile browser, UC Browser can run into some local or general network issues. </p>
<p> Most of the time, the problem is in the network itself. And you can easily pinpoint the culprit by trying some other browser (Chrome should do). If you’re still unable to connect, we suggest following the steps below: </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap on Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth, and reset network settings. This will erase all saved SSIDs, Bluetooth pairings, and APN configuration. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if Chrome does connect but UC Browser is still showing the “No network” error, make sure to try some of these steps: </p>
<p> Clear browser’s cache and data. </p>
<p> Reinstall UC browser. </p>
<p> Enable Data usage in the background </p>
<p> Check Battery optimization for the UC Browser. </p>
<p> And, on that note, we can conclude this article. If you’re still stuck with any of the errors, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. We’ll do our best to help you out. </p>

<p> I was trying to keep my phone on and on the tab list while trying to find if there was a way to undo close tab – I accidentally closed a site below the one I meant to close, and have no idea what page I closed – it’s been there for long time, so looking from history is unlikely to bring it back to me 🙁 Please reply if you: 1) know you just can’t 2) know you can and share it with me.

<p> My UC Mini apk has stopped working with the speed mode on and loads the default web page instead of the compressed web page after stalling. Certain web pages after being saved are also not working and I get unable to load web page due to “err file not found” message when I try to open them.I tried installing and reinstalling the apk but the same errors occurred again with all the versions of the app. Can you please suggest a solution? </p>

<p> Fix: Unable to access camera in Instagram Android app </p>
<p> Instagram without its app isn’t Instagram that we know. And, even though the features are piling up, there are some issues that can’t be overlooked. </p>
<p> We talked about videos playback issue, on both iOS and Android, and today we’ll try and address a preposterous problem that has evoked lately. Namely, some users reported that they were unable to access a camera trough the app. That’s quite a problem since it renders the app, more or less, unusable. You can’t use any of the filters or tools within the app without a camera integration. And that’s somewhat, and you’ll agree, the main purpose of the app. </p>
<p> For that reason, we prepared some of the common solutions for this issue. You can find the complete list below. </p>
<p> Check the permissions </p>
<p> The first step you should take is check for permission changes. As you’re probably aware of, every app needs certain permissions to access your camera, storage, contacts etc. Most of the time, these permissions are auto-enabled once you download and install the app from the Play Store. You agreed to them in order to use app’s features completely. However, things may change if you update your firmware or run some of the administrative tools. Those can restrict some features due to security limitations. </p>
<p> For that reason, it’s worth to check active permissions in the Instagram app: </p>
<p> Tap Apps. </p>
<p> Navigate to the Instagram app. </p>
<p> Open Permissions. </p>
<p> If you’re still unable to open camera within the app, check the steps below. </p>
<p> Clear app’s cache and data </p>
<p> With frequent Instagram updates that are emerging nowadays, regarding Story improvements and those silly face filters, there’s a chance that something may go wrong. Namely, this app tends to accumulate temporary files and, since it’s changing on almost daily basis, those can affect the overall performance or some features, like a camera. </p>
<p> So, make sure to clean apps cache or data and look for changes: </p>
<p> Clear Cache and Data. </p>
<p> If the problem is persistent and mini nervous breakdown is ascending, there are some other steps worth checking. </p>
<p> Update the Instagram app </p>
<p> We already mentioned frequent updates. The app is nowadays so feature-rich that it’s almost chaotic. But, while it’s cool to have all of those features, it’s still more important to have the elementary functions working. What to do with the Instagram Boomerang or face filters or other effects if you’re unable to access a camera in the first place. </p>
<p> What we can hope for is that one of those updates may address this issue. That’s good enough reason to fly over to the Play Store and check for updates immediately. </p>
<p> Choose My Apps & Games. </p>
<p> Look up for Instagram in the Updates tab. </p>
<p> Hopefully, this should be enough to resolve your problem. However, if it’s still there, take these additional steps into account. </p>
<p> Reinstall the Instagram app </p>
<p> Reinstallation is somewhat obsolete, but it can help you sometimes. Android is the OS just like so many others, and where is software there’s a room for issues. This is especially the case with the firmware updates, like latest Nougat, that affected certain handsets in a lot of negative ways. So, make sure to, after the firmware update, clean reinstall troublesome apps. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reinstall the Instagram app: </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> That should be enough to resolve most of the app-related issues. But, what if the Instagram app isn’t the problem in the first place? </p>
<p> Update the firmware </p>
<p> Yes, we said that the system updates, besides the improvements in different sectors, often bear more than a few issues. But, some OEMs that are professional and responsible, tend to offer a resolution for previously made slips. So, there’s a chance that your next system update may fix this bug that restricts your camera in the Instagram app. </p>
<p> Make sure to check for the updates and install them timely. </p>
<p> Use exclusively a native camera app </p>
<p> Firstly, we are assuming that you’re using native camera app instead of some 3rd-party solutions. Those are known for failed integration with other apps, meaning: sometimes they just won’t work within other apps, like Instagram, WhatsApp or Viber. So, make sure that your native camera is set as a default. You can look into that by following these instructions: </p>
<p> Navigate to Apps. </p>
<p> Under Apps, open Settings. </p>
<p> Open Default Apps settings. </p>
<p> Make sure that the native camera is set as the default. </p>
<p> Now, once we’re over that and if the problem with the Instagram is still there, we’re afraid that there are only two things you can do. At least, as we’re aware. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition data </p>
<p> There’s a chance that your camera is the problem, in the first place. Or it’s system integration. Some users managed to resolve a multitude of camera-related issues by the clearing cache partition data. This won’t affect your data, so you shouldn’t lose any of your apps, settings or multimedia. Also, have in mind that the procedure may differ, so make sure to google the steps for your device. </p>
<p> This is how to run this recovery procedure: </p>
<p> Make sure your device battery is at least at 20% and Turn Off the device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the combination of Volume Up, Home, and Power Keys. </p>
<p> Wait until the Android System Recovery screen appears and release all keys. </p>
<p> Use the Volume Down key to navigate to ”Wipe cache partition”. </p>
<p> Select ”Wipe cache partition” with the Power button. </p>
<p> Use the Volume Down key to highlight ‘Yes’ and press the Power button to confirm. </p>
<p> After the procedure is finished, confirm ‘Reboot system now’ with the Power button. </p>
<p> Reset device to factory settings </p>
<p> If everything that we presented until now fell short, there’s a chance that the factory reset is the only solution. We advise you, as always, to backup your data before starting with anything as terminal as this. In addition, prepare for a long time of customizing your settings and preferences. You can do it by following these steps: </p>
<p> Open Backup & Restore. </p>
<p> Choose Factory Data Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Device. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and insert your passcode or PIN. </p>
<p> The process should take about 5-10 minutes. </p>
<p> After that, your Instagram app should be, finally, able to access camera so you can snap those selfies just like before. </p>
<p> In addition, don’t forget to share questions or alternative solutions in the comments. We’ll be grateful. </p>

<p> Top 9 most underrated browsers for Android </p>
<p> As far as web browsing goes, handheld devices are taking over. With upgraded software and hardware capabilities, you can use your phone the same way you use PC. You can surf the web, stream videos or play flash games. All of that in a fast and safe manner. And on the move, which is a main advantage of the mobile devices over their computing predecessors. </p>
<p> Android is the leader when it comes to quantity of available apps. You’ll spend 20 years to browse and use all of them. And in that abundance of apps, leading spot is reserved for web browsers. We’ve all heard of Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari. They are widely acknowledged solutions, with both mobile and PC versions. </p>
<p> Additionally, some other android-specialized browsers already made their names, like CM, Dolphin, and UC. They attract thousands of users every day. However, there are some less known browsers that are valid competition to the famous ones. So today, we are presenting you 10 most underrated Android browsers that are worth trying out, and definitely deserve more attention from users. </p>
<p> Top 9 less known Android browsers </p>
<p> Habit </p>
<p> Habit Browser is one of the best all-around solutions available. Its main traits are a variety of customization, other apps integration, and speed. With Habit browser, you can adapt the user interface to your liking. All the buttons order, toolbars and address bar are all customizable. So, when it comes to modification of the browser’s UI, Habit is there at the top. </p>
<p> Another great thing that Habit brings to the table is integrated URL redirecting. Simply said, while browsing the web content, you can choose the different app to open a link anytime. For example, you can open an Instagram link with the Instagram app instead of with the browser itself. That way the browsing experience is vastly improved. </p>
<p> Additionally, all of that is done in speedy and clear manner. Habit don’t need other apps or add-ons to use gestures or Pie control feature. However, lack of implemented adblocker and occasional instability can cause mixed reactions. Otherwise, Habit is a great solution for all Android users. </p>
<p> Flynx </p>
<p> Flynx is a game-changer in the web browser category. Its minimalistic nature and multitasking features make it one of the more distinctive browsers in the Store. Similar to the Facebook Messenger, Flynx is a background-functioning bubble browser. While you are browsing the Facebook or Twitter, Flynx can open any link and place them in bubbles on your screen. In addition, it does that in a useful and uncluttered way. When you open a link with Flynx, the app stores site data so you can inspect it later. That way, you can open multiple ‘tabs’ in minimized form and access them with ease. The app is specialized in article reading because of the intuitive interface and offline accessibility. </p>
<p> Multitasking is Flynx’s middle name. It loads articles and links without interfering with the source app, like WhatsUp or Facebook. Fast Read feature optimizes loaded articles for easy read blocking all clustering adds. In comparing to its numerous features, the app is quite undemanding, well optimized for even the older devices. It lacks some multi-device syncing features its competitors have and can get a bit laggy with multiple articles opened. If we exclude those minor flaws, Flynx is, besides Link Buble the best sidekick browser in the market. It makes your browsing more productive in an aesthetic way. </p>
<p> Lightning </p>
<p> The first impression when you install Lightning is ”this app lives up to its name”. And it truly does. With its light domineer and simplistic interface, this open-source app is all about smooth and safe web browsing. Screen viewing is improved with nicely hidden bars and toolbars. Although, some users may find it but underwhelming features-wise, it contains all of the basic browser options packed in the 200KBs of space. Yes, that’s the download size of the app. </p>
<p> Security and privacy are 2 most respected traits in modern time browsers. Lightning Web Browser certainly excels in that department. With support for Orbot and Tor proxy and implemented Incognito mode, you can rest sure that no one can track your sensitive information or location. </p>
<p> If you want the web browser that is created for simple use and speedy workflow, Lighting is a viable solution. </p>
<p> Naked </p>
<p> No matter how much RAM you have on your device, sooner or later you’ll encounter more than a few web browser lags and crashes. Why? Well, if we exclude games, web browsers are the greediest resource monsters. Even though the Chrome is so popular, it irrationally consumes RAM while bombarding you with the bloatware. And your dual-core budget phone simply is not equipped for the task. Alas, don’t worry cause Naked is here to the rescue! </p>
<p> So, what is Naked, you may ask? Well, for starters, it doesn’t include any inappropriate content whatsoever. The name actually well describes this app. It is bloatware-free, as simplistic as they come, web browser mainly oriented towards budget devices. </p>
<p> The interface is similar to built-in web browsers on older Android versions. But, then again, you won’t expect any astonishing features from a minimalistic browser. It is fast and uses almost twice less RAM when compared to popular browsers. In addition, it is very safe to use since it doesn’t collect any sensitive information and inflicts with your privacy. </p>
<p> Brave </p>
<p> After the first try to make an innovative breakthrough failed, Brave Software gave it the next shot with returning to fundamentals. But, don’t let that trick you. This browser, built on Chromium web browser base, excels in certain categories well over mighty Chrome itself. First and foremost is built-in Ad blocking feature. The leading principles behind Brave development are to provide complete privacy and stop tracking of user information. Of course, the browser blocks only overly intrusive ads, that can auto-install malware on your device. Your favorite site can still make income from your visits. </p>
<p> Interface-wise, the Brave looks a lot like Chrome with the specific color palette. It is quite fast and the developer claims that it is 2 (to even 4) times faster than popular browsers. You can try it out and see for yourself. </p>
<p> Puffin </p>
<p> As many tech professionals claim after numerous tests: Puffin is the fastest and most responsive Android browser in the market. As a matter of fact, this browser can easily overcome Chrome or Firefox any given day. At least, performance-wise. Puffin rendering speed and load speed are remarkable. Additionally, you can play latest flash games in theater mode with virtual gamepad controls. Since it packs integrated flash, additional downloads are not needed. The virtual trackpad is another interesting option that can prove helpful while browsing, especially on large screens. </p>
<p> The user interface is intuitive and well-designed with few customizable features. Security-wise, Puffin offers Incognito tab that will prevent tracking and protect your personal data. However, if the privacy is your first priority, some other solutions are much better in that category. </p>
<p> Yandex </p>
<p> Yandex is, simply put, a Russian version of Google. The search engine that is vastly popular in Eastern Europe. As same as the better-known Google, Yandex offers browser solution for all possible platforms. Additionally, Android version of Yandex Browser is based on Chromium, so they are even created on the same base. Now, you may ask is it worth using Yandex instead of Chrome. And the answer is yes! </p>
<p> We already mentioned Chrome’s abuse of the RAM and lack of privacy protection. Yandex is stable and undemanding, so it won’t deplete all your device resources. It offers a security system called Protect that will stop all compromising sites. In addition, it supports many add-ons. People are mostly satisfied with address bar placed at the bottom of the screen, colorful backgrounds and Reader mode. </p>
<p> Ghostery </p>
<p> If you are sick of trackers and have a strong stand on security while browsing, Ghostery is the right app for you. Many users are tired of profiling that is conducted online, closely followed by gazillion ads and pop-ups. Ghostery is, as the developers states, the consumer’s privacy advocate. And you must respect that. The browser is simple and convenient while trying to keep up the pace with the competition. </p>
<p> So, performance or UI are not the things that distinguish this browser. It’s security and privacy measures that make it a viable option. Ghostery contains largest tracker and scripts database of all privacy-oriented browsers. You can keep track of all trackers on every site you visit. </p>
<p> APUS </p>
<p> APUS Browser is one of the best alternative web browsers available. Most of the light weighted browsers are not this well designed and lack a lot of features. APUS have few innovative solutions, and we will specially mention Download Manager and No Image Mode. Additionally, you can install a lot of add-ons and get rid of ads with AdBlock. Tab switching is fluid and browsing speed is right there with the best ones. </p>
<p> In our humble opinion, the best feature is well-implemented download management that lets you download almost every type of media and store it on your device. Moreover, you can store it directly on SD card, which is great. The APUS functions well with other apps but on some occasions slow downs overall device performance. If the Incognito mode and Ad Block are good enough for your privacy standards, this is the app worth trying. </p>
<p> The Bottom Line </p>
<p> This was our list of best alternative browsers for Android. We must be honest, Chrome has better features than most of them when filled with various add-ons. But, if you are using a budget phone or want some specific feature in your browser, this list should be helpful. Do you have some other app to </p>

<p> Fix: “Unfortunately CloudAgent has stopped” error on Samsung handsets! </p>
<p> There’s just so many system errors on Android that are as annoying as this error. It affects solely Samsung devices and it can be quite a drawback if we take into the consideration the fact that you like to integrate your 3rd-party cloud app in handset’s interface and workflow. </p>
<p> Users reported Dropbox as the instigator, but there are some isolated cases when this error crashes One Drive or Google Drive. Although, the main culprit for the issue is a system service called Cloud Agent that is a known perpetrator of crashes and resource hogging. For that purpose, we enlisted a few workarounds that should help you resolve the issue at hand. </p>
<p> If you have run into this error, it’s worth to check them out below. </p>
<p> Sign out and sign in again on the troubled cloud app </p>
<p> As you might know, the cloud applications (as many others) tend to integrate into Samsung’s native interface, mainly through widgets and Gallery. Now, that can occasionally cause a problem or two. In this case, it may result in crashes followed by this error. The first obvious step in order to address this issue is to clear data and cache and sign again. That way, any mild integration-related issues should be, hopefully, dealt with. </p>
<p> Follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Application manager. </p>
<p> Navigate to the cloud service that invoked the error (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive etc.) </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Navigate back to App menu and open the app. </p>
<p> Update the app </p>
<p> Updating the app is one of those default troubleshooting steps, but it still might prove as a valid solution. Namely, certain apps, due to changes within the system, might start misbehaving. Furthermore, if a certain bug is present in a temporary release, it should be resolved in the future updates. So, make sure to update your cloud app. </p>
<p> Open the 3-line menu. </p>
<p> Tap ”My apps & games”. </p>
<p> Download and install updates. </p>
<p> If even the updated version keeps on inflicting the error, you can turn to additional steps we presented below. </p>
<p> Reinstall the app </p>
<p> On the other hand, reinstallation could be a better suited for this kind of undesirable scenario. Namely, if the app is corrupted for no apparent reason or frequently causes errors or performance drops, we advise you to remove the troubled app and reinstall it. Follow the instructions below to do so: </p>
<p> Tap and hold the troubled cloud app from the App list. </p>
<p> Draw it to the top and Uninstall it. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Open Play Store app. </p>
<p> Look up for the app and install it. </p>
<p> Shut down CloudAgent </p>
<p> Now, let’s move to more system-oriented troubleshooting steps. Cloud Agent Service is Android System service that deals with the integration of built-in cloud and t3rd-party cloud apps (like Dropbox or OneDrive). What you’ll need to do is to stop it and start it again. That should relieve you of the obvious bug that is frequently reported on Samsung handsets. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Tap Application Manager. </p>
<p> Select All. This should include the system services besides the standard apps. </p>
<p> Navigate to Cloud Agent on the list. </p>
<p> Once you’re there, clear Data and tap Force Stop. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> However, this will prevent integration of Dropbox or similar cloud apps within your Gallery. </p>
<p> Reset to factory settings </p>
<p> Finally, if the problem is still there and you’re experiencing the same unpleasantry with the ”Unfortunately CloudAgent has stopped” error, we advise you to turn to a factory reset. Sometimes even the built-in system services and processes can go rogue and start hogging on resources or, in this case, crash related applications. </p>
<p> So, the factory reset sounds like an unwilling but needed step in order to address this issue. </p>
<p> Open Backup & Restore. </p>
<p> Choose Factory Data Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset Device. </p>
<p> Confirm selection and insert your passcode or PIN. </p>
<p> The process should take about 5-10 minutes. </p>
<p> In addition, you can use Samsung Smart Suite on your PC for the same operation. </p>
<p> That should do it. If you have any questions or suggestions, give us a shout in the comments below. Thanks for reading and have a great day. </p>

<p> How to use Android phone as a computer gamepad </p>
<p> A lot of PC games are playable with just your keyboard and mouse. First person shooters originated on that input game controls and they are most certainly best suited for the job. But, what happens when you want to play, for example, Fifa 17 or any third-person action game? Then, and we all can agree, the gamepads are a preferred option. At least, for the majority of gamers. The main advantage of gamepads is their ergonomy and buttons order that, with few additions over time, haven’t changed for decade or more. All gamepads are lookalikes, cause they are based on the same, good old classic origins. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, while gamepads and joysticks are gaming foundation stones, they are for all intent and purposes, connected to consoles. It is hard to find good and affordable gamepad for PC that is similar in quality and sturdiness with the ones of PS4 or Xbox One. So, if you are not in possession of any of the two, maybe you should look at your phone or tablet. Yes, you can use your Android as a gamepad and play your favorite games in no time. </p>
<p> We prepared for you 3 applications that will let you play your favorite PC titles with your Android. </p>
<p> Mobile Gamepad </p>
<p> Mobile Gamepad is an interesting solution that transforms your Android into the reasonably good wireless gamepad. Players shouldn’t expect miracles, but it will get the job done. Most of the time, at least. This app functions only with a server application on PC, so you have to download and install suggested version. </p>
<p> First, you install both Android app from Play Store and a server program for your PC. Once installed, you have to make sure that the Android and PC are on the same wireless connection and share same IP address. The server works out the connection, Android app everything else. Button mapping is made easier with a game list that program enables, so you can define them respectively. Games can be started with the phone itself, without even touching the PC, because it can simulate a mouse. </p>
<p> What is great about this app and make it worth trying is the utilization of your gyroscope and accelerometer for in-game purposes. You can use it for movement and they can come handy for racing games. </p>
<p> DroidPad: PC Joystick & mouse </p>
<p> DroidPad is similar to a Mobile Gamepad in many regards but brings some additions. It comes with three options: Joystick, Mouse, and Slideshow. There are 8 joystick layouts to use and many customizable options for a better experience. Mouse option is also very adjustable so you can make it work to your liking. Slideshow mode lets you use your phone as a tool to control presentations without even interacting with your PC. </p>
<p> Installation is pretty much the same as with Mobile Gamepad. After you install the application, next step would be to download and install server program for your PC. Server program will automatically discover your device once connected via Wi-Fi or USB port. After you choose a preferable mode, Android will connect to a PC and your job is almost done. Next step is to select wanted Joystick layout and tweak preferences. After that device is ready to use. </p>
<p> This app is great 3 in 1 multimedia solution and can be of great use as a gamepad substitute for all undemanding users. </p>
<p> Ultimate Gamepad </p>
<p> Ultimate Gamepad can be the ultimate solution for all of you that want to try out your Android as a gamepad. In comparing to the other two listed apps, it doesn’t have so much tweaking options and customizing your options is a bit lackluster. But, on the other hand, it brings multitouch option and Bluetooth connection to the table. By many users, it is described as best ”Android to PC gamepad” application and is certainly worth trying out. </p>
<p> Connecting your Android to a PC is as easy as it comes. You can choose between Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection. Wi-Fi option demands both devices be connected to the same network, and it is a bit better way to connect because you want to preserve battery life of the Android. Gamepad looks just like the ones for the PS1. There is no analog sticks but only D-pad. It works great, the connection is stable and commands are responsive. The only problem we encountered comes with the devices with larger screens. The gamepad is always the same size so you ‘ll have a problem using it properly with tablets. With exception to that, everything works like a charm. </p>
<p> To try out this great gamepad solution, go to this link. </p>
<p> This was our list of suggested apps. We hope you ‘ll find it helpful and use some of them to play your favorite games. Have you tried any of them before? What is your opinion on the subject? Be free to tell us in the comments section. </p>

<p> How to use Google’s Recorder on non-Pixel devices </p>
<p> Last year’s Pixel 4 event was a peculiar one. Many experts and users agree that Google didn’t exactly hit the jackpot with its new line of Pixel devices. The Pixel 4 and 4 XL don’t have the best battery in the industry, rock a questionable design, and preach Google’s stand that an ultra-wide camera lens is overrated. </p>
<p> To even the scales, Google also released a little something that most people will agree is a useful feature. A voice-recording app. Now, can one app make up for all the questionable decisions? That’s up to you to decide, and is not a topic of this article. </p>
<p> As you probably know, Google’s Recorder is exclusive to Pixel devices (except Pixel 1). And you can’t use it on any other Android phone. That’s a shame because the app is quite well-made and practical. And if they had a chance, I’m sure many users of non-Pixel devices would also consider using it. </p>
<p> But here’s the thing: using Google’s Recorder app on non-Pixel devices is actually possible! You just can’t install it the traditional way. </p>
<p> As it turns out, Google released an official APK file of the Recorder app, and it’s available for download for free. The only downside is that it’s not the latest version, but all the signature features (recording and transcribing) are there. </p>
<p> But that’s not all! Mishaal Rahman of XDA Developers modified the latest version of the app, and shared it with everyone. So, props to him and the whole XDA team for always breaking the barriers to ensure users can have the best possible experience using their Android phones. </p>
<p> How to download and install Recorder on your Android device </p>
<p> Long story short, in order to use the Recorder app on your phone, all you need to do is to download and install the APK. </p>
<p> However, there are still a few “requirements” you’ll have to meet in order to run the app without any problems. For example, the app doesn’t work on Xiaomi devices running MIUI 10 or MIUI 11, although there are reports of Recording working on Android One devices, like the Xiaomi MI A3. </p>
<p> Here’s the list of phones/manufacturers that can run the Recorder app: </p>
<p> Google Pixel and Pixel XL running Android 10 </p>
<p> Huawei and Honor phones running EMUI 9 (Android 9 Pie) or EMUI 10 (Android 10) </p>
<p> LG phones running LG UX 8.0 (Android 9 Pie) </p>
<p> Motorola phones running Android 9 Pie </p>
<p> Nokia phones running Android 9 Pie </p>
<p> Samsung Galaxy phones running One UI 1.0/1.5 (Android 9 Pie) or One UI 2.0 (Android 10) </p>
<p> Sony Xperia phones running Android 9 Pie or Android 10 </p>
<p> Any phone running a custom ROM based on AOSP Android 9 Pie or Android 10 </p>
<p> The app partially functions (the recording works, but the app fails to transcribe speech) on the following devices: </p>
<p> ASUS phones running ROG UI 2.0/ZenUI 6.0 (Android 9 Pie or Android 10) </p>
<p> OPPO and Realme phones running ColorOS 6 (Android 9 Pie) </p>
<p> OnePlus phones running OxygenOS 10 (Android 10) </p>
<p> As I mentioned above, you can download both an official or modified version of the app, and it shouldn’t cause you any problems as long as you’re using a phone from the list above. </p>
<p> Make sure to tell us about your experience using Google’s Recorder app on your phone. Do you have any problems with it? Or does it run as smooth as on a Pixel device? Let us know in the comments below. </p>

<p> How to view Google Maps in 3D on Android </p>
<p> Google Maps is one of those Google services, like Google Photos, that everyone can use and rely on. There might be better navigation solutions, but to have a free service covering the whole globe is more than welcome. It even offers Satellite, Street, or Terrain views, but users were wondering why the 3D satellite view went away from Google Maps. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we decided to dig a bit deeper into Google Maps and find out how to get a 3D view back. Learn more about it below. </p>
<p> How do I see 3D Google Maps on Android? </p>
<p> The option that you are probably looking for (3D buildings and terrain rendering) is gone from Google Maps and moved to Google Earth. If you have Google Earth installed on your Android, it’ll integrate with Google Maps and allow you for extra exploring. </p>
<p> There’s still an option to see 3D objects (kind of) on Google Maps for Android, but that’s only available in the Standard view and not really worth it. If you switch to a Satelite view, you should only see a 2D rendition of a map. </p>
<p> Many users were unsure why this happened but this is how Google rolls, trying to integrate as many apps with not-so-distinctive features as possible instead of unifying all into one. </p>
<p> Just look at the instant messaging disaster that was Hangouts, Allo, Duo, and Messages or Google Play Music and YouTube Music. </p>
<p> Nonetheless, it is what it is and we can all just come to terms with it or use an alternative app. So, to conclude, the 3D satellite view on Google Maps can be used with Google Earth integration. For that, you’ll need to install the Google Earth app first. </p>
<p> Open Play Store and search for Google Earth. </p>
<p> Download and install the app. </p>
<p> Open Google Maps. </p>
<p> Choose your current location or any other location you would like to see in a Satellite 3D view. </p>
<p> Now, tap on the hamburger menu and then tap Google Earth. </p>
<p> Choose 3D and zoom in to see objects in a 3D view from any angle. </p>
<p> That’s it. Google Earth definitely has some things going on for it. While Google Maps is a more navigation-oriented map, Google Earth allows for detailed exploration. </p>
<p> With that, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and don’t forget to post questions or suggestions in the comments section below. We welcome your feedback, as always. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/view-notification-history-android-pie" parent_folder="web1" id="file17841688" filename="view-notification-history-android-pie">
<p> How to view the notification history in Android Pie </p>
<p> In this day and age, receiving notifications on your smartphone is basically a sign you’re alive. There aren’t many more satisfying things than seeing all the likes your latest Instagram post has attracted. But the constant flow of new notifications can be annoying sometimes. Especially of those notifications you don’t want to see every 15 minutes. </p>
<p> On one hand, you can control it. For example, that news app that keeps bombarding you with articles you actually want to read, just not right now. So, you go and disable all the notifications from that app. </p>
<p> On the other hand, you can’t control all of them. Example: you don’t want to keep receiving promotions from your carrier via SMS, but you can’t avoid it since you don’t want to disable the notifications from your text app altogether. </p>
<p> When those “uncontrollable” notifications appear, you, driven by a minor dose of rage, tend to swipe swiftly and clear your notification drawer as fast as possible. And in that haste, you dismiss a notification or two you didn’t actually mean to. </p>
<p> These dismissed notifications aren’t lost forever, as it initially appears. They’re stored in the system’s Notification Log, and you can easily go back to them. Unfortunately, you can just use the Notification Log as a reference tool, as there’s no way of actually retrieving notifications. Plus, it’s not very user-friendly. </p>
<p> That’s where, just like with pretty much everything else in Android, third-party apps come to rescue. Yes, there’s an app that allows you to access your recently dismissed notifications, and even undo them. The app is called Unnotification, and it’s free and user-friendly. </p>
<p> I’m going to show you both ways. If you just want to keep your notifications in check, use the built-in tool, as it doesn’t require a third-party app. If you’d like to have a tool that allows you to retrieve notifications, go with Unnotification. </p>
<p> How to view the Notification Log in Android Pie </p>
<p> Many people are actually not aware of it, but Android keeps the record of all the recently received notifications. And you can easily access it. However, this system feature is not supported on all Android phones. For example, you will find it on the Pixel models, but Samsung Galaxy phones miss this this option. </p>
<p> Also, the Notification Log only allows you to view recently dismissed notifications. There’s no way of bringing them back. The downsides are obvious. But the advantage of this method is it requires no third-party apps. </p>
<p> So, if you just want to see the notification history on your phone, do the following: </p>
<p> Long-press the Home screen. </p>
<p> Tap Widgets. </p>
<p> Scroll down, and drag the Settings widget to the Home screen. </p>
<p> Choose Notification Log. </p>
<p> Now, tap the newly-created shortcut, and you’ll see the log of all the dismissed notifications. </p>
<p> You can now see why this method isn’t so user-friendly. The only thing it’ll show you besides the list of dismissed notifications is a line of code that shows all the complex details of the notifications. Something you, unless you’re a developer, would probably have a hard time understanding. </p>
<p> How to retrieve deleted notifications in Android Pie </p>
<p> Another, more convenient and user-friendly way of not only viewing the Notification Log but also retrieving the dismissed ones is using an app called Unnotification. It’s available in the Play Store for free. </p>
<p> When you install and set up Unnotification (grant it permission to access Notifications), it will start running in the background (and keep running all the time). While running in the background, the app will ‘listen’ for new notifications. Whenever you dismiss a notification, you’ll automatically be asked if you want to undo your move. It works for everything in your Notifications drawer, whether it’s a new Facebook message or Spotify playback control, for example. </p>
<p> Additionally, a new tile named Last Notification will appear in the Quick Settings menu. Tapping this button will bring back the most recently dismissed notification. So, even if you missed to undo that notification right on the spot, you can still bring it back with this button. </p>
<p> You can also access the above-mentioned Notification Log through this app. Just open the app, tap log button (checklist icon) in the upper right corner, and it’ll open the system’s Notification Log. And finally, you can also blacklist apps you don’t want Unnotification to have access to by pressing the + button in the lower right corner. </p>
<p> Tweak Unnotification for a better experience! </p>
<p> The downside of using Unnotification is that it will constantly run in the background, and you won’t be able to dismiss its own notification. Plus, constant prompts asking you to retrieve dismissed notifications will eventually become annoying. </p>
<p> But don’t worry, there’s even a solution for that! You can choose to prevent Unnotification from running in the background, and make it stop asking you to un-dismiss notifications. All you have to do is open the app, go to Settings (the gear icon), and untick everything except the Use Quick Settings Tile Only option. If you ask me, this is the best way of using this app. It eliminates possible annoyances without sacrificing too much its functionality. </p>
<p> And there you have it. You now know everything you need to know about retrieving dismissed notifications in Android. So, you’ll never have to fear about swiping away the wrong one. </p>

<p> Check them out below. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check your network connection </p>
<p> You Visual voicemail won’t work if you’re not properly connected to the internet. So, make sure you’re connected to a Wi-Fi network, or you have Data on. </p>

<p> Now, head over to General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Enter your passcode. </p>
<p> Tap Reset network settings. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I certainly hope at least one of these solutions helped you deal with the Visual Voicemail issue in iOS 11. </p>

<p> Fix: VPN not connecting on Android </p>
<p> Using a VPN these days is nothing strange, although we can all agree that it’s not exactly a necessity for so many users. As some media outlets and influencers like to present them, at least. It all depends on how much you care about your privacy and what kind of geo-limitations you want to circumvent on your mobile device. Some users who do find them important have run into a problem where VPN is just not connecting on Android. </p>
<p> We made sure to explain why this might happen and provide you with a list of applicable solutions that will, hopefully, help you address the issue. </p>
<p> Why is VPN not connecting on my Android phone? </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Make sure that the VPN access is allowed </p>
<p> When you use your VPN client for Android for the first time, there should appear the prompt to add and enable VPN in the System Settings. You’ll get a Connection request and, once you accept it and connect to a preferred IP address, you’ll see the Key icon in the Status bar. </p>
<p> So, make sure to navigate to the VPN app and connect to any available location. Accept the connection and you should be able to connect without issues. On the other hand, if the VPN is still not connecting on your Android, continue with the steps below. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Reset cache and data from the VPN app </p>
<p> Alternatively, like with any other app that doesn’t function as intended, you can navigate to App settings and clear the cache and the data. There’s always a possibility of data corruption which might result in issues with the app. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reset cache and data from the VPN app: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps, then Application manager, All apps, or Manage apps. </p>
<p> Find your VPN solution and open it from the list of all apps. </p>
<p> Choose Storage. </p>
<p> Tap Clear Cache and then Clear Data. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Disable WLAN assistance and check the connection </p>
<p> Certain OEM’s offer various solutions that ensure stable connection by simultaneously switching from one to another Wi-Fi network or to Mobile Data. Of course, if the current network is unstable, crashing, or just being super slow. This might break VPN so we suggest disabling those options. </p>
<p> In addition, the Virtual Private Network uses your physical IP address, filters it (replaces it with an alternative IP from your preferred location), and masks your current location that way. This means that you still need a stable Wi-Fi network in order to utilize a VPN. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to learn how to disable WLAN assistance and troubleshoot the connectivity on your Android device: </p>
<p> In the Notification shade, tap and hold on the Wi-Fi icon until you open Settings. Once there, open Additional (or Advanced) settings. Disable WLAN assistant and all similar modes. </p>
<p> Restart your router and your handset. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth and NFC temporarily. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall the VPN </p>
<p> In addition, you might want to reinstall the VPN and give it another go. We already mentioned that you have to ensure that your subscription is paid in case you are using a premium VPN solution for mobile. </p>
<p> If that’s indeed the case, reinstalling the VPN might help. Just navigate to Play Store, locate your VPN by searching for it, and uninstall it. Reboot your device and install the VPN of your choice (the one you are subscribed to, obviously) again. </p>
<p> In case the VPN is not connecting again on your Android handset, try fixing it with the remaining solution. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reset Network Settings </p>
<p> If none of the previous steps worked for you, the problem might lie in the WLAN configuration on your device. Something might be wrong so we recommend resetting your router and resetting Network settings on your device. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Search Reset in the search bar and open Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Tap on Reset and confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Try with an alternative VPN solution </p>
<p> Finally, if the VPN of your choice just won’t work on your handset no matter what you do, consider canceling the subscription and switching to an alternative. And there are indeed plenty of alternatives on the Play Store. </p>
<p> We can recommend NordVPN and you would support the development of our website by buying it from the affiliate link above. This VPN is widely recognized and rather reliable on both Android, iOS, Windows, or Mac. However, it’s solely your choice. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and, in case you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to tell us in the comments section below. We look forward to your feedback. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/waiting-for-activation-imessage" parent_folder="web1" id="file17841392" filename="waiting-for-activation-imessage">
<p> Fix: “Waiting for activation” error with iMessage </p>
<p> iMessage is probably the most convenient mean of communication if most of your friends are in the Apple ecosystem. But as with any other app, issues that may slow you down occur from time to time. </p>
<p> One of the most annoying iMessage situations is when you can’t activate it, and when you’re greeted with that scary “Waiting for activation” message. And since you’re not already signed in to iMessage, I assume you got your iPhone recently. I’m sure this issue spoiled the initial excitement we all feel when getting a new phone. </p>
<p> But don’t worry, because we’ll try to deal with that infuriating “Waiting for activation” message in this article. And if we’re lucky enough, you’ll be able to chat and exchange goofy emoji with your friends in no time. Or at least soon enough. </p>
<p> Re-enable iMessage </p>
<p> Most of the time resolving this issue is as simple as re-activating iMessage. So, let’s start our (hopefully short) troubleshooting process here. Here’s how to re-enable iMessage: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to Messages. </p>
<p> Make sure iMessage is disabled. </p>
<p> Reboot your iPhone </p>
<p> Now, head back to Settings > Messages, and re-enable iMessage. </p>
<p> Ideally, you would see the results right away. However, there’s one thing that certainly doesn’t make it easier for you. And that’s the fact that it may take up to 24 hours for iMessage to reconnect to Apple’s servers and activate. </p>
<p> That may leave you in the limbo where you can’t know whether the issue has been indeed resolved. So, you’ll have a much clearer picture once this period passes. In the meantime, you can try some alternative solutions and see where that gets you. </p>
<p> Re-enable FaceTime </p>
<p> Although re-enabling FaceTime won’t directly help you when dealing with the iMessage issue, it could help in determining the cause. That’s because FaceTime and iMessage use the same servers, so if one app doesn’t work, the other one probably won’t either. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to FaceTime. </p>
<p> Make sure FaceTime is disabled. </p>
<p> Now, head back to Settings > FaceTime, and re-enable FaceTime. </p>
<p> Check your internet connection </p>
<p> Although the Messages app can be used for exchanging SMS messages (which don’t require any internet connection whatsoever), registering and using the iMessage part requires the internet connection. Preferably WiFi. </p>
<p> So, before proceeding to other solutions, swiftly make sure you’re properly connected to the internet. And before all, make sure Airplane Mode isn’t on. As you probably already know, this feature blocks all the connections on your phone to prevent potential data losses while you’re up in the sky. If Airplane Mode is on, there’s no chance you’ll be able to activate iMessage. </p>
<p> To disable Airplane Mode, just go to Settings, and toggle the option off. It’s literally the first item in Settings. </p>
<p> Check the time settings </p>
<p> Having incorrect time and date would’ve normally been highly unlikely, but assuming you just got your phone, there’s a chance a mistake slipped through. And if date and time are not correct, you could face all sorts of issues, with our iMessage error being just one of them. </p>
<p> Head over to General > Date &Time. </p>
<p> Toggle the Set Automatically option off. </p>
<p> Set the correct date and time. </p>
<p> Update your iPhone </p>
<p> iOS updates are a strange bunch. While some bring great features that we enjoy using, other releases can really mess up your whole phone. So, it’s possible you were unlucky enough to install an update that somehow disrupts iMessage. </p>
<p> Now, I can’t tell if that’s indeed the case because I don’t know when you’ll be reading this article. But what I can tell you is that if an update is indeed the cause, there’s probably not much you can do about it. If you suspect an update could be the culprit for the “Waiting for activation” error, do some research online. See if other people are complaining about it and if there’s actually a solution. </p>
<p> If there’s no know solution, basically all you can do is wait for another update and hope Apple will address the issue soon. </p>
<p> Sign out of iCloud and then back in </p>
<p> If reactivating iMessage didn’t work, maybe you should think on a bigger scale, and re-sync your whole iCloud account. Okay, that was a lame attempt to sell you the most generic solution in IT, but it might actually get the job done. So, why not give it a try, if nothing else works. </p>
<p> Here’s how to sign out of your iCloud account, and then sign back in: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap your name, and go to Sign out. </p>
<p> Type your Apple ID password and tap Turn Off. </p>
<p> A window asking you which data you want to copy from your iCloud account to your phone. keep in mind that this might delete some data from your phone, so you’ll want to carefully read the instructions on this page. </p>
<p> Once you’ve decided what you want to keep, tap Sign Out. </p>
<p> Now that you’re signed out, head back to Settings, and go Sign in to your iPhone. </p>
<p> Enter your credentials, tap Next, enter your passcode, and you’re back in. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings </p>
<p> If none of the solutions listed above helped, you might also consider resetting your network settings. However, keep in mind that doing this will reset all your settings, without actually resolving the problem, and all you could potentially end up with is more work. So, you’ll probably want to wait those 24 hours and see if iMessage actually activates. </p>
<p> But if you’re willing to take the risk, here’s how to reset your iPhone settings: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Head over to General > Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Reset All Settings. </p>
<p> Confirm that you want to reset all your settings. </p>
<p> Contact Apple Support or your carrier </p>
<p> This is as far as I can get you. If iMessage couldn’t activate after you tried all of the solutions listed above and waited for 24 hours, it’s best to contact your carrier first, and if they’re unable to fix the problem, Apple Support directly. </p>
<p> Who knows, maybe your carrier will be able to do something, like updating your settings with the latest servers, for example. You’ll only find out if you contact them. </p>
<p> And if your carrier fails to resolve the issue, there’s always Apple support. </p>
<p> That’s about it. I hope I helped you get rid of that annoying “Waiting for activation” error, or that I at least pointed you in the right direction towards resolving this inconvenience.

<p> How to watch Mayweather vs. McGregor with VPN on your mobile phone </p>
<p> Two mixed martial worlds collision, the Bout of the century, Money Fight. All of those refer to a single battle that pushes the boundaries of the fighting sports themselves. Floyd ”Money” Mayweather Jr. vs. Connor ”The Notorious” McGregor. The hype that’s following this fight can mean only one thing: people will spend large amounts of money to see this spectacle. </p>
<p> Sadly, if we exclude certain countries, the majority of the world won’t be able to watch this battle in the standard pay-per-view orders. And who would want to skip on this? Luckily, there’s a way to overcome geo-boundaries and order a pay-per-view stream on your handheld device with the little help of VPN. </p>
<p> What you need to do is to use the VPN on your phone to switch to US or UK server. That should enable you to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime event. Follow the instructions below to use the VPN service and obtain a pay-per-view access. Since we are from the non-supported area, our choice is ExpressVPN that will, due to its private servers, provide us with uncluttered bandwidth and ultimate streaming speeds. </p>
<p> Get VPN and install it on your device. ExpressVPN supports both iOS and Android platforms. </p>
<p> Connect on U.S. or U.K. server in order to breach. </p>
<p> Order your virtual tickets, lean back and enjoy the spectacle. </p>
<p> This is probably the most expected match in the history of modern boxing with so many distinctions. One one side we have a tenacious MMA champion, in the opposite corner, arguably the best defensive boxer with the perfect score. McGregor as an underdog and Money as a favorite. Some folks tend to speak about this as just a show, a circus or a spectacle centered on unprecedented earnings for both fighters. Nonetheless, we’re sure that this will be an amazing bout, and we’ll finally see that the fighters will give us interesting closure after months of trash talk, media war, and both mental and physical preparations. </p>
<p> And all of that from the leisure of your home, on your tablet or phone. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/what-is-android-system-webview-and-should-you-disable-it" parent_folder="web1" id="file17842855" filename="what-is-android-system-webview-and-should-you-disable-it">
<p> What is Android System WebView and should you disable it? </p>
<p> You know how every app, if not set otherwise, opens web links and pages within some browser-like pop-up? That’s what Android System WebView is for. This built-in interface-less app will provide integration for web content in basically all apps instead of switching to Chrome or any other browser. This should, ideally, reduce RAM usage and rendering. </p>
<p> If you were wondering how to (or should you even) disable Android System WebView or how to enable it later, we made sure to explain it here. </p>
<p> Should you disable Android System WebView? </p>
<p> Let’s cut the chase and say that you can switch to an alternative Chrome WebView on Android 9 (and previous Android iterations), but you won’t be able to disable or uninstall WebView at all. </p>
<p> You can, on the other hand, uninstall updates for the app (restore it to factory values) on the Google Play Store or locally, within Settings. In case you have any issues with the WebView rendering, that’s the best troubleshooting step to try. </p>
<p> With Android 10, Google decided to discontinue Chrome WebView as an option, so you won’t be able to use it. So, default system webview is what you should use. Basically, to sum it up, no, you shouldn’t (and can’t) disable Android System WebView. </p>
<p> This is a necessary component and as such, it’s a part of the Android system. What Android System WebView does is web-pages rendering in third-party apps. That’s why you don’t have to open links externally, in Google Chrome or any other browser. They just pop within the app. Albeit, you can usually change that within app settings. </p>
<p> How to enable Android System WebView </p>
<p> If you made some mistake in regards to webview services or the service isn’t working as intended, you can find the available implementations in Developer options. If you are not sure how to access the Developer options menu, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose System (or About phone or This device). </p>
<p> Locate and tap on the Build number 7 times to enable Developer options. </p>
<p> Open Developer options and locate WebView Implementation or something concerning WebView. </p>
<p> Certain OEMs might offer their own WebView services, enforcing integration of their own built-in default browsers. Like Xiaomi and MiWebView. </p>
<p> You can enable use it if you are using the default browser although, for the overall stability, we don’t suggest using anything other than Chrome WebView (Android 7.0 Nougat) and Android System WebView (Android 10). </p>
<p> That should do it. Thank you for reading and, if you have any questions or anything else to add or take, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/whatsapp-not-receiving-messages" parent_folder="web1" id="file17845354" filename="whatsapp-not-receiving-messages">
<p> Fix: WhatsApp not receiving messages </p>
<p> WhatsApp, owned by Facebook, is one of the most used instant messengers today with more than 300 million daily users. Besides the standard chat, you can use it to send all kinds of multimedia files. However, that’s not of much use if WhatsApp is not receiving messages. </p>
<p> Users reported that they are unable to see received messages but, strangely enough, can send messages without any issues. Learn how to resolve this with the steps below. </p>
<p> Why am I not receiving messages on WhatsApp? </p>
<p> If you are not receiving messages on WhatsApp, chances are that’s a widespread server issue. On the other hand, it’s quite possible that the problem is on your side. In most cases, the contact is accidentally blocked or there are connection issues at hand. </p>
<p> Either way, we suggest moving through the list below in order to troubleshoot the problem. Hopefully, you’ll be able to receive messages on WhatsApp again after following the solutions we provided for you. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Make sure that you haven’t blocked a contact </p>
<p> Firstly, make sure that the contact that sends you files isn’t on your Block list. If contact is blocked, you won’t be able to see any of the messages sent to you. Sometimes, erroneously, you might even get a notification about the message but it won’t come through. </p>
<p> Click on the 3-dot menu and open Settings. </p>
<p> Select Account. </p>
<p> Unblock contacts to allow them to send you messages on WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Clear the cache and check the connection </p>
<p> Going forward, ensure that your device is connected to either Wi-Fi or the mobile data is enabled. Sometimes, due to an unstable connection, some multimedia messages might not go through fully. </p>
<p> After that, we recommend clearing WhatsApp cached data from your handset. If you are unsure how to do it, follow the steps below: </p>
<p> Open Manage apps. </p>
<p> Locate and open WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Log in with your number and check for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Reinstall WhatsApp </p>
<p> In case the app is still misbehaving, reinstalling it might help. This will also ensure that you have the latest stable version of WhatsApp. Just make sure to back up your chat history or you’ll lose all your messages. </p>
<p> Here’s how to reinstall WhatsApp on your handset: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > WhatsApp and uninstall the app. </p>
<p> Restart your phone and open the Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for WhatsApp and install it. </p>
<p> Look for improvements. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Disable Mobile Data limitations </p>
<p> Certain OEMs offer the per-app option to disable or limit Mobile Data. Therefore, if you are unable to receive messages on WhatsApp when the mobile data ON, we recommend checking this feature that’s possibly preventing WhatsApp from using the mobile connection. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Select Apps. </p>
<p> Open Manage apps. </p>
<p> Under the Restrict data usage, make sure that both WLAN and Mobile Data are enabled. </p>
<p> Now, open WhatsApp, click on the 3-dot menu and open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Data and storage usage. </p>
<p> Under the Media auto-download section, select what kind of files will be downloaded on Mobile Data, Wi-Fi, and when roaming. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Check the storage </p>
<p> As you already know, in order to open multimedia content received via WhatsApp, you need to download and store it on your device. </p>
<p> Now, even though WhatsApp will compress files a bit in order to reduce their size, videos and photos these days are quite large. And, if you don’t have enough storage space, you won’t be able to receive files. </p>
<p> We recommend backing up some files to cloud storage, SD card, or your PC and delete them from your phone to get some space. Also, clearing cached data from apps will provide you with a hefty chunk of free storage space. </p>
<p> Choose Storage. </p>
<p> Tap on Cached Data. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Leave the Beta program </p>
<p> Finally, if you enrolled in the Beta program for WhatsApp, we suggest leaving it and sticking with the public release for the time being. </p>
<p> Here’s how to leave the Beta program on WhatsApp: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for WhatsApp and scroll down. </p>
<p> Under the You’re a beta tester, tap Leave. </p>
<p> Once you are out of the Beta program, update the app. </p>
<p> With that step, we can conclude this article. Thanks for reading and make sure to tell us about your problem or share alternative solutions in the comments section below. Your feedback is more than welcome. </p>

<p> Fix: WhatsApp not ringing on Android </p>
<p> Arguably, the best uses of modern instant messengers are VoIP and Video calls. Nonetheless, the fact that WhatsApp is a third-party app might cause issues, as some users report that WhatsApp is not ringing for them. </p>
<p> WhatsApp was one of the first third-party platforms that brought this free and nifty functionality and now lots of people use it as their go-to service for calls. Not exactly of use if it doesn’t notify you about an incoming call. </p>
<p> Why is my WhatsApp not ringing? </p>
<p> There are multiple reasons why WhatsApp is not ringing for some users. The problem usually occurs due to faulty settings, concerning notifications or the ringing tone. </p>
<p> Alternatively, it tends to be connected to system optimization applications that prevent WhatsApp from working in the background. </p>
<p> If you are stuck and clueless on how to address this issue, make sure to check the steps below. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Check Notification and Permission settings </p>
<p> Let’s start by inspecting System Notification settings and permissions. Chances are Call notifications are either completely disabled or not permitted on the lock screen. So, let’s inspect Notification settings for WhatsApp and ensure that the device will ring the next time you receive a call. </p>
<p> Here’s how to allow Call Notifications for WhatsApp: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps (App Manager or Manage Apps). </p>
<p> Choose WhatsApp from the app list. </p>
<p> Select Notifications. </p>
<p> Firstly, make sure that Show notifications and Lock screen notifications are enabled. </p>
<p> After that, scroll down and open Call notifications. </p>
<p> Enable Show notifications, set Importance to High, set Ringtone to None (it will use the default ringtone that way), and, finally, ensure that Notifications are allowed on the lock screen. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Use a default system ringtone </p>
<p> Instead of using its own ringtone like some other instant messengers, WhatsApp uses the system-set ringtone by default. Of course, there’s an option to change the ringtone and that’s where the issue might occur. </p>
<p> Namely, if you set a custom ringtone and the audio file gets deleted or moved, WhatsApp should switch to a system ringtone automatically. Except it doesn’t do that always. </p>
<p> In order to resolve this, you should switch from a local ringtone to a default one. Any of the pre-installed system sounds will do. Follow the instructions in the first solution and either set the WhatsApp ringtone to None or choose some other system sound. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Disable System and Battery optimization for WhatsApp </p>
<p> The main downside of OEM Android skins (besides the bloatware, obviously) are those pesky, aggressive managers that will kill apps and prevent them from working in the background. </p>
<p> In addition, battery optimization, although advised, might prevent WhatsApp from working, especially on Huawei’s EMUI. That’s why we recommend disabling Battery optimization and whitelisting WhatsApp in System Manager. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Clear cache and data </p>
<p> If WhatsApp is not ringing even after you’ve followed the aforementioned troubleshooting steps, try clearing data and cache from the app. After clearing the cache and data, you’ll need to reinsert your phone number in order to sign in again. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to clear the cache and data from WhatsApp: </p>
<p> Open Manage apps. </p>
<p> Locate and open WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Reinstall WhatsApp </p>
<p> Finally, if none of the previous solutions worked, we recommend reinstalling the app and trying again. Many users managed to address the problem by reinstalling WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to reinstall WhatsApp via the Play Store: </p>
<p> Open Play Store and navigate to WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Uninstall the app. </p>
<p> Install the app again and reboot your device. </p>
<p> Log in again and check for improvements. </p>
<p> That’s a wrap. Thanks for reading and we sincerely hope any of these steps helped you. In case you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to tell us in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<p> What is WhatsApp Quick Reply and how to disable it </p>
<p> In the sea of instant messengers, there’s probably one name that stands out. The WhatsApp instant messenger is by far the most popular app in the Play Store. Since the Facebook acquisition, this multiplatform service had various improvements while the core stayed the same. One of the additions was the Quick Reply option which allows users to receive the full content of a message in the background. </p>
<p> That way, you can reply in a matter of seconds and move on with whatever you were doing. However, when it comes to privacy, this feature isn’t exactly the most prying-eyes-proof addition. </p>
<p> Everyone can see or even interact with the messages without unlocking the device. Since Android Lolipop, users have had a hard time configuring the notifications to allow the sound (even see the senders name), but hide the content. </p>
<p> All things considered, Android Oreo made a breakthrough by allowing basically all messaging apps to provide you with Quick Reply. This native feature completely negates any value the native Quick Reply in WhatsApp. In addition, it limits third-party apps in meddling with the lock screen. You can tweak it in the Notification settings menu. </p>
<p> How to disable Quick Reply </p>
<p> That’s probably the reason why the Quick Reply pop-up, which is solely a part of WhatsApp, is nowadays disabled by default. But, if you have enabled it for some reason and want it disabled, follow these steps to do it: </p>
<p> Open WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Tap on the 3-dot menu and open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Notifications. </p>
<p> Under the Popup, notification select “No popup”. Do the same for Group notifications. </p>
<p> If you, on the other hand, want to apply a more strict approach, open Settings > Apps & notifications > All apps. Select WhatsApp from the list. Once there, open App notifications. After that, follow these steps to restrict popups on the Lockscreen. </p>
<p> Under Chats, tap on Group notifications. Watch out not to toggle it off. </p>
<p> Scroll down and, under the Advanced section, expand On the lock screen. </p>
<p> Now, here choose to hide sensitive notifications content. </p>
<p> Get back and do the same for Message notifications. </p>
<p> After that, you can be sure that no WhatsApp popups will appear. If you have anything else to add or take, be so nice to do so in the comments section below. </p>

<p> How to restore WhatsApp chat backup on Android </p>
<p> Unlike Facebook Messenger or some other instant messengers, WhatsApp doesn’t store chat backups on any servers as it supports end-to-end encryption. Messages are only stored locally. We all welcome that as privacy is an important topic these days, but there is one minor downside to that. </p>
<p> Namely, if you uninstall WhatsApp from your device or clear app storage, all your chat history will be gone. Luckily, there’s an option to back up your chats to Google Drive which can be a lifesaver. But how do you restore those backups? Can you back up photos and videos? Keep on reading and you’ll find out in no time. </p>
<p> Where does WhatsApp back up my chat history? </p>
<p> As you probably know, WhatsApp uses Google Drive as a go-to cloud client to store backups. These backup files, due to an agreement between Google and Facebook (which owns WhatsApp), do not take any storage space. Which is great if you have a ton of multimedia-filled chats you care to save. </p>
<p> Every new backup just updates over the old one, uploading only changes. The downside is that you can save one and only one backup. When creating a new backup, the old one gets overwritten. This can’t be surpassed as there’s no way to export chats and store them locally. </p>
<p> How to configure WhatsApp chat backup? </p>
<p> Moving forward, you can configure a variety of options concerning backups, enable automatic backups, change the frequency of backups, etc. Also, you can allow for backups to be created on Mobile Data or change the Google Account you want to use to store backups. </p>
<p> Basically, a variety of nifty options you probably should inspect. Just open WhatsApp and then navigate to 3-dot menu > Settings > Chats > Chat backup and you’ll see numerous options concerning backing up your chat history along with multimedia files. </p>
<p> How can I get my old WhatsApp messages? </p>
<p> Now, restoring a backup to WhatsApp is quite simple. You’ll get prompted whenever signing into WhatsApp for the first time. Just make sure to sign </p>
<p> However, it depends on what Google Account you have assigned to WhatsApp. If you are using one and particular Google Account on your devices, restoring a backup should be a walk in a park. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you are signed on your device with a different Google Account, you should sign in with the one related to WhatsApp or backups to restore won’t be available. </p>
<p> With that out of the way, here’s how to restore your WhatsApp chat history from Google Drive: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Apps and then All apps, App manager, or Manage apps. </p>
<p> Open WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Choose Storage. </p>
<p> Clear the App Data. </p>
<p> After that open WhatsApp and sign in with your number. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions and, when prompted, choose to restore a backup. As simple as that. </p>
<p> Have in mind that backups older than 1 year will be automatically deleted from Google Drive. And no, you can’t back up the backups locally and restore them later. It’s just the way it is, sadly. </p>
<p> With that said, we can wrap it up. Thank you for reading and we hope this was helpful. Don’t forget to tell us what are your thoughts on the backup system WhatsApp is utilizing or present us with certain issues you’ve encountered along the way. You can do so in the comments section below. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/whatsapp-wont-send-pictures" parent_folder="web1" id="file17842570" filename="whatsapp-wont-send-pictures">
<p> Fix: WhatsApp won’t send pictures </p>
<p> Contemporary instant messengers are so versatile that you can, with most of them, send any file to your contacts. Of course, WhatsApp can send any file format (up to 100 MB), including pictures and videos. However, some users stated that, for some reason, WhatsApp won’t send images. </p>
<p> If you are affected by this, make sure to continue reading below. </p>
<p> Why can’t I send pictures on WhatsApp? </p>
<p> There’s a variety of reasons why WhatsApp won’t send pictures. If we exclude the ones on the server-side, the problem might lie in the low storage space, inaccurate time and date, or inaccessible SD card. Among other things, of course. </p>
<p> First, ensure that the picture you want to send is stored locally. In addition, it’s important that your Wi-Fi or mobile data connection is stable. If you can confirm both, but WhatsApp won’t send pictures, move to solutions below. </p>
<p> With this troubleshooting guide, you should resolve the problem in a matter of minutes. </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Clear app data </p>
<p> Let’s start by clearing the pilled up data from the WhatsApp app. We suggest backing up all received files since this procedure will erase them. You can do so by moving them to a different folder or by using WhatsApp’s own Google Drive backup feature. </p>
<p> Select Manage apps. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check storage space </p>
<p> Usually, storage is the problem when receiving messages, however, it’s still advised for all users to keep some free storage space in order for WhatsApp to work in a seamless manner. </p>
<p> Here are some tips to grab some extra space on your smartphone: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Storage and clear Cached Data. </p>
<p> Backup your files to Google Drive (or any other cloud storage of your choice) and delete them from your phone. </p>
<p> Alternatively, back up your files to PC. </p>
<p> Uninstall unused apps from your device. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Check Time and Date </p>
<p> Another possible reason for delayed or incomplete incoming messages or, in this case, failing to send pictures, lies in inaccurate date and time settings. What you need to do is enable automatic time on your device. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to set a proper time and date: </p>
<p> Choose System or Additional settings. </p>
<p> Open Date & time. </p>
<p> Toggle ON the “Use network-provided time” option. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Reinstall the app </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can try and reinstall the app if WhatsApp still won’t send pictures. That way, you’ll start from scratch while getting yourself the latest update. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to reinstall WhatsApp: </p>
<p> On the home screen, tap & drag WhatsApp towards the top until you are prompted. Choose Uninstall to remove WhatsApp from your phone. </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for WhatsApp and download it. </p>
<p> Insert your phone number and log in again. You’ll be prompted to restore any backups from Google Drive. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Inspect SD card (give access) </p>
<p> If you store your multimedia files on external storage, chances are that the SD card leads to issues. It can either be a permission-related issue as WhatsApp can’t access your SD card to load pictures for sending or, alternatively, the SD is corrupted. </p>
<p> Tap Apps. </p>
<p> Select Manage apps. </p>
<p> Choose Storage. </p>
<p> Select the SD card. </p>
<p> Choose Format and confirm. </p>
<p> Solution 6 – Leave the Beta program </p>
<p> Finally, if you enrolled in the WhatsApp Beta program, we recommend leaving it. These releases are not as stable and there might be a bug at hand. Going for a stable public release is a safe bet. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to leave the WhatsApp Beta program: </p>
<p> Open Play Store. </p>
<p> Search for WhatsApp and scroll down until you reach the You’re a beta tester section. </p>
<p> Tap Leave and wait until you are removed from the Beta program. </p>
<p> Restart your phone and update WhatsApp. </p>
<p> That’s it. We sincerely hope one of these solutions helped you address the issue. If WhatsApp still won’t send pictures, make sure to report it to WhatsApp support. In addition, if you are aware of alternative solutions, be so kind as to share them with us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Android lost in fire: The explanation behind the Exploding Phones </p>
<p> We all remember that massively hyped battery issue with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Instead of a few isolated cases, this took a remarkable attention since it had been reported all around the world. </p>
<p> Of course, when a few elite aero companies prohibit the specific device from going onboard, you know that’s a serious matter. People were kind of joking about it, the internet went crazy, and Samsung withdrew the Note 7. Later on, similar cases occurred with S7. Luckily, not that frequent. </p>
<p> Exploding phones are not a novelty but, but the issue waited for recognition until 2016. Few distinct cases here and there were not enough until it becomes a dangerous trend that spreads all around the world. Now, many people would say that the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is the main culprit for this, but faulty exploding batteries are one of the not so sublime ways to remind us that manufacturers are sometimes moving too fast with hardware advancements. </p>
<p> How is that so? Well, the Lithium-ion batteries are not up to the task. The modern devices are the way too challenging for them. It’s just a simple fact. We present you 4 main reasons for this peculiar doings. Stay tuned. </p>
<p> How a smartphone transforms in DIY bomb with few easy steps </p>
<p> Faulty batteries that got approved </p>
<p> Essentially, we live in the consumeristic society that is quite demanding. We want all and we want it now. Manufacturers response to the society needs is creating quantity over quality. To speed up the process, various companies use a large variety of sub-companies production until the final product is ready for the market. </p>
<p> Smartphones are not excluded. So, parts for the infamous Note 7 are coming from different hardware producers around the world. Yes, they do the testing but that can’t be as thorough as they should be because of deadlines. </p>
<p> Long story short, the Samsung may get a faulty, untested batteries. The separators that are there to prevent collision of electrolytes in the battery are the most probable cause of fire and explosion. To be on point, they have to be rather resistant. According to Samsung that was the main reason for exploding Note 7. Additionally, only o,1% of sold devices have that issue. But the reliability questioned and damage has been done. </p>
<p> Let’s make underpowered battery to run overdemanding device </p>
<p> Lithium-ion batteries are already exhausted. It’s a technology that can’t withstand demanding hardware. And flagship models are quite demanding, to say the least. As the scientists in the matter stated, the Li-ion batteries can’t be improved. The new technology solution is needed to overcome the power consumption and life of the battery. </p>
<p> But, as that is easier said than done, all of the awaited devices will be powered with the Li-ion. With upgraded screens, octa-core processors and remarkable cameras. But can they work seamlessly with the power supplier that is not up to the task? </p>
<p> Additionally, why not make it charge for 20 minutes instead of hours </p>
<p> Charging your battery is an unwilling process. It requires you to be stationary and thus renders your use to one place. We like to move a lot and exploit the mobility of the phone. Charging is necessary but immensely dull. And those witty manufacturers have a brilliant idea to overcome hours of charging process. </p>
<p> Let’s charge them faster. Fast charge feature is great for obvious reasons but it will substantially lower the battery life expectancy. Over time, that leads to a faster discharging and possible issues with the battery. Is this the cause for the battery to burst into flames? Not on its own. But, once you combine overheating, shock and faulty battery, everything is possible. </p>
<p> At the end, maybe just a little higher voltage for ultimate results </p>
<p> We already mentioned that battery Li-ion batteries are hard to improve. One of the ways certain producers do is increasing voltage. That is done by adding other conductors besides lithium. That can improve their charging capacity but will result in additional instability. </p>
<p> Have in mind that stability is one of those features that are too often overlooked. There are some mentions of more stable batteries but they’ll probably lack the battery life. In our opinion, it is much better to prevent the catastrophe than taking unnecessary risks. </p>
<p> The Bottom Line </p>
<p> We don’t want to exclude consumers responsibility in the matter. By using your phone with care, you lower the chance of battery issues. Nevertheless, the production had to find an alternative energy solution in the upcoming years. Until then, we will use Li-ion batteries and challenge them effortlessly. And if the battery has even the slightest change, replace it for your sake. </p>

<p> Fix: Wi-Fi keeps forgetting networks on iOS 10 and later </p>
<p> Stable Wi-Fi connectivity is fundamental for everyday iPhone use. Without it, you won’t be able to update, backup, surf web or post on social networks. In all occasions and all locations. And phone data can be costly. Additionally, you would want to save passwords for all those networks. Who can remember them and moreover, who would insert network credentials every time it is in its proximity? No one. Ever. </p>
<p> And here we get to an issue that occurred after the update to iOS 10. According to some users, after the update, their iPhone keeps forgetting already confirmed networks. In most cases, the problem occurs with hidden SSID networks. Before the update, everything worked seamlessly. We will try and address this issue with few possible workarounds. </p>
<p> Unhide your network SSID </p>
<p> We are well aware that this can be a security risk and it is not recommended. On the other side, movielike hackers with their unarticulated keyboard inputs can overcome it quite easily. And most people won’t even try. So if you are not surrounded by that sort of PC enthusiasts, you can try and unhide your network. A lot of users with this issue resolved it that way. On the other hand, if your access to router settings is limited (work network), this can proof as mission impossible. </p>
<p> Restart your device and router </p>
<p> While we are at simple solutions it’s worth mentioning the restart options. Like most of the Apple’s customer support technicians would often do. Nonetheless, you should try it out. So, power cycle wireless router and restart your phone. Now try reconnecting. If the network is still forgotten, move on to the next steps. </p>
<p> Reset iPhones Network settings </p>
<p> This solution proved as most suitable for the majority of users. Namely, by resetting your network settings, you’ll clear possible errors in the software. Those that can easily cause this or similar connection problems. To do so, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap General. </p>
<p> Select Reset. </p>
<p> Choose Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Have in mind that this way you’ll lose all saved Wi-FI networks and passwords. At least, the next time the phone will save them and auto-connect. However, if that is not the case, we have one more ace up our sleeve. </p>
<p> Erase all Content and Data, restore from iCloud </p>
<p> The last thing we can advise you to do is restoring your phone. This may seem a bit too extreme, but it is our only hope. So, while we are waiting for Apple to pay attention to its customer’s needs, let us try this workaround. The first step would be backing up your data to an iCloud. In addition, if your backup is not set to auto-backup, you can do it manually this way: </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Tap iCloud. </p>
<p> Select Backup. </p>
<p> Tap Back Up Now. </p>
<p> After you’ve backed up your data, move on to a restoring. These are the steps: </p>
<p> Choose Reset. </p>
<p> Tap Erase all content and settings. </p>
<p> In Apps & Data screen tap Restore from iCloud Backup. </p>
<p> Select preferred backup and restore your iPhone. </p>
<p> This should be the ultimate solution. Again, if you’re still unable to resolve this issue, your only hope is some of the upcoming updates. Let us hope that Apple will address this simple but annoying issues. </p>
<p> Do you have any other helpful propositions? Then be sure to share them with us in the comments section. </p>
<p> 2 COMMENTS </p>
<p> This issue has actually been around since at least as far back as iOS 8, and I speak from personal experience. What’s more is sometimes entering the correct password will outright fail and prompt for credentials again, and time and time again Apple has BLATANTLY refused to do ANYTHING about it as of iOS 12. I’m getting royally pissed off, and want to meet somebody who works at Apple for the sole purpose of screaming in their face about their almost intentional, company-wide ANTI-competence. </p>

<p> Yeah, literally none of these things work. Also, this problem is AT LEAST as old as iOS 7. </p>
<p> I wish Apple would stop with their fetish for incompetent programmers fixated on cramming dozens of completely pointless new features into every update, instead of actually doing something useful and trying to fix the problems that people are having. </p>
<p> Is it seriously so much to ask for them to go in there and fix the Wi-Fi problem? Do they even try?! </p>

<p> Apple hit the world by storm by announcing it will be acquiring the most popular music recognition service for both Android and iOS, Shazam. But that’s old news already. </p>
<p> The main question right now is what Apple plans to do with Shazam. Experts agree that the main goal of this purchase is to beef up Apple’s own music streaming service, Apple Music. </p>
<p> Namely, Apple will likely use Shazam technology and the development team that came with the purchase to implement some new features into Apple Music. Most likely a song-suggesting feature. </p>
<p> But what does this mean for Shazam users on iOS’ rival operating system, Android? </p>
<p> First of all, don’t worry about the Android version of Shazam being killed off. The good old ‘acquire to shut down” model is unlikely to happen here. Shazam still has more than 100 million downloads on Android, so I doubt Apple is willing to give up that much of a potential profit just for the sake of popularizing its own services. </p>
<p> On the other hand, what’s very likely to happen is that the Android app won’t be updated so frequently. Shazam is currently out of top 100 most popular apps on Android, and Apple probably won’t try so hard to get it back on the track. </p>
<p> We’ll possibly see some iOS-exclusive features for Shazam in the future. As I said, probably some kind of integration with Apple Music. But the Android version could stay the same for some time. </p>
<p> The only scenario where Apple could shut down the app for good is for the sake damaging Apple Music’s biggest competitor, Spotify. Currently, more than 1 million users use Shazam as a referral for Spotify. </p>
<p> To sum this up, if you’re an Android user, you probably don’t have to worry about Shazam. The way things look now, the app will stay in the Play Store. You only won’t be able to use some potential new features, that will be iOS-exclusive. </p>
<p> What do you think about the whole story? What’s Shazam’s future on Android? Let us know in the comments below! </p>
<p> 1 COMMENT </p>
<p> Wrong. As I am an Android user you neglected to mention that now when i have a shazam and I want to play it now, Apple only gives me the option to listen to it on Apple Music. This is terrible. </p>
<p> No Android user is going to do that. Therefore I am leaving Shazam. They should have allowed us to choose our own then i would have been fine with it. </p>

<p> How will your apps work on iPhone X </p>
<p> Apple, as one of the most valuable companies in the world, has a unique privilege. The company is allowed to set the tone in the industry and pioneer the new standards for others to follow. And that’s exactly what Apple is trying to achieve with the iPhone X. </p>
<p> That’s a new level of challenge for those who should follow these trends. And I’m not talking about Apple’s competitors, but those who give the meaning to the platform in first place – app developers. </p>
<p> App developers will need to adapt their products to the new concept of the iPhone X. In order for everything to work seamlessly. So, the question naturally arises, how will the apps work on the iPhone X for a first few months? </p>
<p> The answer is – there’s no concrete answer. It all depends on an app individually. So, I’ll try to give as deep insight into the situation as possible, for you to know what to expect from your apps for the first time being. </p>
<p> Apps performance on iPhone X </p>
<p> The iPhone X is powered by a powerful A11 Bionic chip, which can only do good to your apps. So, the concern about how will your apps perform on the new iPhone is practically non-existent. </p>
<p> Built-in apps and services work faster than ever. And there’s really no third-party app that will push this device to its limits. If you’re a regular iPhone user, you’ll certainly notice a positive change in the way apps function comparing to previous iPhone models. </p>
<p> Browsing the internet is faster, accessing the email and messaging apps is faster, and a 7 megapixel, TrueDepth-enabled camera will work wonders in Snapchat, Instagram, and other apps that require taking occasional selfies. </p>
<p> So, the performance of your apps on the iPhone X is something you really shouldn’t worry about. Which is, I’d say, completely normal, as anything less than that on a $1000+ phone would be just absurd. </p>
<p> On the other hand, using apps on the iPhone X may feel a little awkward at first. It will probably require some accustomization on your side and a few tweaks and updates on the developers’ side. </p>
<p> Which brings us to our next point. </p>
<p> Apps usability on iPhone X </p>
<p> Some third-party apps will probably need additional polishing, in order to be aesthetically compatible with the iPhone X. There are two things that will possibly annoy some users for the first time being. </p>
<p> The first thing is the new bezel-less OLED screen (which is not completely bezel-less). Some apps are simply still not optimized for the new screen. So, you could end up with a black frame in some apps. </p>
<p> This will definitely kill the feeling of the new screen. In that case, the phone won’t look like it’s supposed to look, and the full potential of the screen won’t be used. </p>
<p> Then, there’s the absence of the home button. This will require some adapting when using the phone as a whole, but could also have the impact on the apps directly. </p>
<p> To leave the app, you need to swipe up from the bottom of the screen. As if you’re putting the app back in its shortcut. </p>
<p> So, when the app freezes (and that could also be caused by the absence of the home button), you wouldn’t be able to carry on with your old practice of pressing the home screen until the problem is magically resolved. </p>
<p> Basically, the only thing left to do is restarting your phone. And that could be a little annoying and time-consuming. </p>
<p> All of this, of course, applies to the third-party apps only. Built-in iOS apps are perfectly optimized, and the only (minor) challenge you could face is accustoming to using them a little bit differently than on your previous iPhone. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> You really shouldn’t look at these minor irregularities as some downside of the iPhone X. Instead, look at it as a natural process of developing the whole experience. </p>
<p> I’m sure this article will be relevant for just another month or so. In the meantime, developers will already update their apps to be perfectly compatible with the iPhone X, and by then you’ll already get fully accustomed to all the changes this device brings. </p>

<p> Fix: Android phone not recognized on Windows 10 </p>
<p> Connecting your Android phone to Windows 10 PC should be as simple as possible. The drivers auto-install as soon as you connect the device and that’s all there is. You select File Transfer and the next thing you see on your PC is the prompt informing you that there’s new storage available. But, many user reports state that their Android phone is not recognized on Windows 10. </p>
<p> Why is my phone not connecting to my computer? </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Try an alternative port and reboot your devices </p>
<p> The first thing you should try is to switch to a different USB port. There’s a slight possibility that the port you are using is not working as intended. In addition, we highly recommend rebooting both your smartphone/tablet and Windows 10 PC. </p>
<p> If your Android phone is still not recognized on Windows 10 even after switching ports and rebooting both devices, make sure to move to the next step. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Make sure that to use the original USB cable </p>
<p> This is important. Usually, it shouldn’t matter as long as the fitting cable is used. However, many users reported that the issue resolved by simply switching cables. So, if you are unable to use the original USB cable, make sure to get a proper replacement. </p>
<p> That should be it when it comes to hardware. In case the issue persists, we can move to drivers. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Check Windows 10 drivers </p>
<p> Now, the most common reason why Windows 10 won’t recognize an Android phone is faulty drivers. Most smartphones these days use generic MTP drivers which are enough to access both internal storage and SD Cards on Android devices. They might be outdated so we recommend updating them first. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to update drivers on Windows 10: </p>
<p> Plug your phone into USB. </p>
<p> Right-click on the Start menu and open Device Manager. </p>
<p> Click on View and enable the Show Hidden devices option. </p>
<p> Expand Portable devices. </p>
<p> Right-click on the External Storage and Update driver (automatically). </p>
<p> Now, at the bottom, expand Universal Serial Bus devices. </p>
<p> Right-click on your device and Update driver (automatically). </p>
<p> Now, alternatively, you can also manually install a generic MTP USB Device driver and give it a go if the device is still not recognizable. Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Unplug your phone from the USB port. </p>
<p> Open Device Manager. </p>
<p> Scroll to the bottom and expand the Universal Serial Bus devices. </p>
<p> Right-click on your device and select Update driver from the contextual menu. </p>
<p> Now, select the Browser my computer option and then “Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer”. </p>
<p> Select Portable devices. </p>
<p> Choose the ADB Device. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can download and install ADB drivers manually. You can find them, here. </p>
<p> In case you are still not seeing your smartphone when connected to your PC, you can uninstall all drivers and wait until they automatically install again. Just uninstall both drivers mentioned above. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Enable USB Debugging </p>
<p> Finally, we can suggest enabling USB Debugging from Developer Options on your Android phone. This is a long shot but it apparently helps to mitigate the problem. There might be more options related to USB Debugging, but you don’t have to enable them in order to fix this issue. </p>
<p> Here’s how to enable USB Debugging on an Android phone: </p>
<p> On your phone, open Settings > About phone (or System). </p>
<p> Tap on the Build number seven times. </p>
<p> Get back to Setting where you should see Developer options. </p>
<p> Find and enable USB Debugging. </p>
<p> That’s a wrap. Thank you for reading and, in case you have any questions or alternative solutions, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>
<p> 1 COMMENT </p>
<p> I can’t belive it. I tried almost everything. Then I tried an original phone USB cable, and no problem. </p>

<doc url="https://mobileinternist.com/xiaomi-mi5-battery-drain" parent_folder="web1" id="file17847113" filename="xiaomi-mi5-battery-drain">
<p> Fix: Xiaomi Mi5 battery drainage </p>
<p> Xiaomi is standing firmly with other renowned manufacturers and reassuring us that you can get a flagship-like device for the modest price. Their handsets are as reliable as one would ask for while being quite affordable. </p>
<p> One of the models that established Xiaomi as a contender in the tough smartphone race is the Mi5. Even though the Chinese giant introduced its successor, the Mi6, the Mi5 is still a valid choice if you want a premium specs device for a small price. </p>
<p> However, even though the Xiaomi Mi5 is a good phone, you may encounter some problems from time to time. And sudden battery drains can be quite problematic to deal with. So, today we compiled a list of workarounds you should take into consideration. The ones that should help you retain your battery life and vastly improve your overall experience. </p>
<p> Disable background apps </p>
<p> First of all, you’ll need to take care of the background apps that are draining a lot of battery on the daily basis. You can identify the larger consumers and disable them from running in the background. That can be done under Settings > Additional settings > Battery. Once you’ve found out about exact culprits for battery leaks, follow these instructions to disable them from running in the background: </p>
<p> Navigate to Apps. </p>
<p> Open the main consumers and set the restrictions on for them. </p>
<p> Wait for a couple of hours and look for battery improvements. </p>
<p> Although this will render some services unusable, like push mail or IM messaging, so make sure to exclude apps you frequently use in the background. </p>
<p> Prevent Wi-Fi from always scanning </p>
<p> Another feature that makes a great impact on battery drainage is Wi-Fi Always scanning. When enabled, this feature always scans for available Wi-Fi networks in your surroundings. This may be of use, but it can also substantially affect battery life. For that purpose, we advise you to disable it and move on trough the list: </p>
<p> Tap and hold Wi-Fi icon under Notification pane. </p>
<p> Open Advanced Settings. </p>
<p> Turn off Wi-Fi Optimization and Scanning always available options. </p>
<p> Turn off Sync </p>
<p> The second feature that is worth checking out is Auto-sync. When it’s enabled, multiple apps will use the connection to download/upload data in the background and that will most of the time lead to battery drains. So, make sure to disable it. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open Storage. </p>
<p> Tap Data & sync. </p>
<p> Disable Sync. </p>
<p> You can enable sync once per day, but the permanent activity will, as we said, cause a battery leak. </p>
<p> Disable Performance mode </p>
<p> Performance mode will give a higher priority to performance instead of balanced use. That can lead to battery overconsumption which is the matter we are trying to prevent. So, make sure to disable it and that should, at least marginally, improve the battery life. </p>
<p> Tap Settings. </p>
<p> Open Battery & Performance. </p>
<p> Tap Power settings. </p>
<p> Change to Balanced mode. </p>
<p> Switch GPS to Device only </p>
<p> One feature that affects the battery consumption heavily is Location mode. With some options enabled the phone will automatically perform a location scanning by using the Bluetooth to connect to other devices. A lot of users had much better battery performance when these features were disabled or rather switched to Device only. Follow these instructions to edit Location settings. </p>
<p> Open Additional settings. </p>
<p> Tap Privacy. </p>
<p> Tap Location. </p>
<p> This procedure should reduce battery leaks considerably. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> While the factory reset can be quite a trouble since all of your data is cleared, that’s not the case for the wipe of the cache partition. Basically, with this recovery procedure, you’ll only clear all of the temporary files, and presumably, fix a large variety of bugs or issues. Including the unusual battery leaks. </p>
<p> Follow the instructions below to clear the temporary files from cache partition: </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Hold Power button + Volume Up key until the Recovery screen appears. </p>
<p> Press Volume Up to navigate trough the language menu and select the preferred language with Power button. </p>
<p> In the same manner, select Wipe and reset. </p>
<p> Choose Wipe cache data. </p>
<p> After the procedure finishes, restart your device. </p>
<p> However, if the problem is still there and your battery on-screen time is gradually declining, make sure to check more steps. </p>
<p> Restore the factory settings </p>
<p> If you’ve done all of the previous steps but the battery durability is still subpar, you’ll probably want to perform a factory reset. First of all, make sure to backup your data before moving on with the following steps: </p>
<p> Power off your handset. </p>
<p> Press the Power button + Volume Up key until you see the Mi logo. </p>
<p> Use the Volume Up key to highlight the preferred language and press Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Choose Wipe & Reset. </p>
<p> Select Wipe all data. </p>
<p> Confirm selection with Power button. </p>
<p> When it’s done, reboot the device. </p>
<p> That should restore your factory settings and, hopefully, increase battery on-screen time. </p>
<p> Recalibrate the battery </p>
<p> It may sound silly, but what if your battery is in perfect condition but the readings are plain wrong? You can always replace the battery but we advise you to try the recalibration procedure first in order to get the proper readings. Prepare yourself for the lengthy procedure and follow the instructions closely: </p>
<p> Discharge your phone fully until the phone turns off. </p>
<p> Turn it on again and wait until it turns off.. </p>
<p> Plug your phone into a wall socket, without turning it on, charge it until the on-screen indicator says ”100 percent”. </p>
<p> Unplug your device. </p>
<p> Turn your device on. If the battery percentage is not at the 100%, plug the charger again until the UI shows that the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Unplug your phone and restart it. If the battery is still not at 100%, plug in the charger and charge it until the battery is 100% full. </p>
<p> Repeat this cycle until it says 100 percent. </p>
<p> Now, discharge your battery until the phone turns off by itself. </p>
<p> Fully charge the battery one more time. Don’t turn on the device or disrupt charging. </p>
<p> It’s not advised to repeat this procedure too often. However, after you perform it, the readings should be spot on. </p>
<p> Switch ROM </p>
<p> A lot of more experienced Xiaomi users suggested a ROM switch. Most of the issues with the battery are mainly connected to a Global ROM, so you can obtain Chinese ROM or older version of the Global ROM release. You can find those here with the flashing guide. Make sure to handle this with care and stick to the explanation. </p>
<p> That should wrap up this article. If you have any additional suggestions or questions regarding the workarounds we presented, feel free to tell us in the comments section. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi 5 common issues and how to address them </p>
<p> Xiaomi Mi 5 is one of those devices that, after you take a look at the specs and price correlation, can make you doubt. Premium flagship device for such a low price? Sounds strange but it’s indeed true. </p>
<p> However, the Chinese manufacturer is still lacking some of the experience the greater players have. There are some issues reported on the official forums that need to be addressed if they want to maintain the status of market contenders. On the other hand, some of those can be addressed with a few tweaks here and there. The nature of software available on Xiaomi Mi 5 enables users to troubleshoot certain issues on their own. </p>
<p> For that purpose, we conducted a research and provided you with the list of most common issues on Mi 5. If you’re troubled with certain problems, it may be worth a while to take a look. </p>
<p> Battery draining </p>
<p> We already wrote a dedicated article about the battery drainage on Xiaomi Mi 5, but it’s worth to mention it again. This seems to be a really grave problem for many users since the beginning. To make the things even worse, updates that were presented lately barely touch on this issue. It’s hard to determine which is the main reason behind the battery drains. Some users advise switching to Chinese ROM, others are more in favor of unlocking bootloader and flashing with custom ROM as Cyanogen. We’ll make sure to explain everything in our future writings, but, for the time being, you can check these steps and hopefully decrease the battery consumption to tolerable levels. </p>
<p> Disabling background apps is always a good idea. If you’re not in need of push notifications from a mail client or similar apps, you should disable them. Instead of them working continuously while the phone is idle, you can use them only when needed. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi scanning. This is great if you’re willing to know all available networks all the time. But, it utilizes more battery resources and you should try to disable it and look for changes. </p>
<p> Auto-sync is another feature that vastly affects the battery life. You can sync manually from time to time and there so avoid battery drainage. </p>
<p> Switch to Balanced mode. The Performance mode might be useful if you’re playing GPU-intensive games. If that’s not always the case, the Balanced mode is much better suited and it preserves your battery substantially. </p>
<p> Change GPS mode to Device Only. Other 2 modes are using either Wi-Fi and Mobile Data and they are more precise. But, if your main concern is battery life, it’s better to keep it local. </p>
<p> Switch ROM. As we already stated, there are different experiences with the different ROM’s. It’s worth a shot to change your ROM for an alternative and look for changes. </p>
<p> Wipe a cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset to factory settings. </p>
<p> Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Another serious problem that emerged for some users relates to Mobile Data. As you already know, Xiaomi Mi 5 is a LTE-ready device. But, users reported complete inability to use nothing except the 3G on their devices. Moreover, even then the signal is bad and overall connection quality sub par. Frequent disconnections are making this phone completely unusable in this department. We are not sure what’s the cause of the problem, but there are still some things you can do in order to improve your experience with the device. </p>
<p> Low network coverage </p>
<p> A similar problem that troubles the mobile networking affects the GSM network, as well. Namely, users are experiencing unusual drops of network coverage. If you’re using (as most people do) GSM network to make and receive calls, this is a debilitating problem since it reduces the overall call quality and denies phone’s primary function. In other words, this is a deal-breaker for many users and it completely negates the flagship status that Mi 5 has. </p>
<p> Since the problem is obviously similar to LTE-3G usage, we advise you to take the above-mentioned steps. Maybe through troubleshooting, you manage to improve GSM network coverage. </p>
<p> GPS crashes and lacks precision </p>
<p> This is an unusual issue to start with. Most of the modern devices rarely have GPS problems, or at least, not as grave as Mi 5. Some users measured the precision of the GPS location and it’s up to 5 times less precise than on other handsets. Others have had issues with frequent crashes of GPS which suddenly lose signal. </p>
<p> Most of the time, these are hardware problems and it’s only so much you can do in the software department. However, there are some workarounds that might help you to some extent: </p>
<p> Change ROM. </p>
<p> Use the High Accuracy mode. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset to factory settings. </p>
<p> If your device is under warranty make sure to take it for a repair. </p>
<p> Overheating </p>
<p> Overheating is always a serious problem, especially if it’s not addressed on time. Xiaomi Mi 5 users reported frequent overheating, and some of them experienced prompts that informed them about critical temperatures. There are so many things that can affect this occurrence, starting from battery behavior and intensive use while charging, and even the extended exposure to heat sources. </p>
<p> One way or another, you need to do something or the internal hardware parts might be affected. This can cause critical damage and render the device completely unusable. Things you should take into consideration are presented below: </p>
<p> Don’t use your device during charging. </p>
<p> Make sure to use only supported charger. </p>
<p> Keep your device off the sunlight exposure. </p>
<p> Remove the protective casing. </p>
<p> Check the battery activity and kill intensive background processes. </p>
<p> Take a break from time to time after intensive gaming. </p>
<p> Camera issues </p>
<p> The primary camera on Mi 5 is solid. It’s not amazing, but it should, according to specs, take above-average photos and record vivid videos. Sadly, that’s not the case for all users. They have experienced blurry photos, especially in the low-light surroundings. In addition, the front-facing camera crashes occasionally. </p>
<p> There’s only so much you can do, but test the camera for bugs and/or restore factory settings and switch to other ROM. Some users reported improvements on Chinese ROM. </p>
<p> Restart Camera settings to default values. </p>
<p> Take a hardware check of the camera. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Perform a reset to factory settings. </p>
<p> Download the third-party camera app and give it a try. </p>
<p> Take a device to repair since the sensor might be faulty. </p>
<p> Screen rotation issue </p>
<p> Screen rotation is present for ages, but it never was as important as nowadays with the large phablet-like screens the modern handsets pack. Vertical view enables you to enjoy more in a plethora of features, especially the video playback and certain games. Sadly, some users can’t enjoy the vertical screen as, allegedly, the screen rotation won’t work for them. </p>
<p> There are some things you can do in this case, and we’re presenting them below: </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Switch ROM from Global to Chinese and vice versa. </p>
<p> Additionally, it’s advised to try a custom ROM that’s not MIUI. This requires some tampering with the bootloader, so it’s highly recommended to inform yourself before you get to business. </p>
<p> Can’t restore backup from PC suite </p>
<p> Some users who use Mi PC Suite for backup have had issues with the backup process. Namely, they were prompted to update the phone before the backing up process commences. The awkward thing is that both their Mi 5 and system are up to date. This can be instigated by various causes, and we prepared a list of possible workarounds for the problem at hand: </p>
<p> Enable USB debugging. </p>
<p> Restart your device and PC prior to connecting them. </p>
<p> Use Photos mode instead of File modes once prompted. </p>
<p> Restore factory settings. </p>
<p> Download the latest version of the Mi PC suite. </p>
<p> Backup your files manually. </p>
<p> Sadly, this is an enormous issue that isn’t officially resolved by the Xiaomi technical support. So, all of these are more workarounds and long shots. Until they decide to resolve it, you can either manually backup your data or use cloud services to do so. </p>
<p> That should conclude this article. We hope that you found something useful. In case you have any questions or suggestions, we’ll be glad to answer to those. You can post them in the comments section below. Have a nice day and thanks for reading. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi 9 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Xiaomi extends its praised flagship line of smartphones with the new Mi 9. The phone is a beast by all today’s performance standards. It upgrades an already powerful set of specs with the latest Snapdragon 855, and 8GB of RAM, delivering a package that’s tough to beat. Both performance-wise, and value-wise. </p>
<p> That makes it more difficult for us to find any weaknesses of the Xiaomi Mi 9. And on paper, it doesn’t really have any actual flaws. It all comes down to whether you like certain features (like EMUI) or design of the phone or not. </p>
<p> But in real-life use, users have encountered certain problems. And we’re here to report them and offer solutions for some. So, if you’ve encountered any of the following issues with your Mi 9, I hope you’ll find a viable workaround here. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, and they might never occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, and stumbled upon this article while researching it, DON’T take these problems into consideration. </p>
<p> Screen turning on when charged 100% </p>
<p> One user reported a rather strange issue with wireless charging. Namely, when the phone is connected to a wireless charger in the car, it goes up to 100% and then turns on the screen automatically and stops charging. When the battery percentage drops to 99%, it starts charging again, and the pattern repeats. </p>
<p> Right now, there’s no known solution for this issue. At least software-wise. The only thing you can try is getting another wireless charging. And even then, it’s not guaranteed that the problem will vanish, so you might end up buying a new charger for nothing. </p>
<p> We still don’t know anything else about this problem, so we’re still waiting for an update on the situation. </p>
<p> Face unlock not working </p>
<p> A lot of users have been reporting that the face unlock feature doesn’t work for them, even if they have the Global version of the phone. This is not an issue per se, because the face unlocking feature is available only in certain regions were the Xiaomi Mi 9 was officially launched. </p>
<p> That’s why users in India, China, Spain, Italy, France, etc. can use the face unlock, while users in the Netherlands, for example, can’t. </p>
<p> If you want to use the feature outside of the officially supported regions, you can always change your Region on the phone, but I’m not sure for how long will you be able to go like that. You should also keep in mind that changing the region to India, for example, will also install some additional apps, so you’ll have to deal with more bloatware. </p>
<p> Chinese text on the Lock Screen </p>
<p> One user reported that all of his widgets on the Lock Screen show Chinese text. This ‘problem’ is not exclusive to the Mi 9, as it commonly occurs on the Xiaomi smartphones. </p>
<p> While I don’t know the cause of this exact problem, there are a few solutions. And the most common solution is to download another Theme, because most of the themes in the Theme Market were made by Chinese developers, so it’s relatively easy to end up with a Chinese theme. </p>
<p> Another solution people recommend is flashing another ROM, which is a more radical solution, but you can try it if the Chinese text sticks. </p>
<p> Notifications missing </p>
<p> One of the most common problems of the notches is space. You simply don’t have enough space on a screen with a big notch for both clock and notifications. That’s the case with the Poco F1, Mi 8, and numerous other smartphones. That’s why a notification icon briefly appears for a few seconds, and then disappears behind the clock. </p>
<p> However, all these phones have big notches, which isn’t the case with the Mi 9. As the Mi 9 features a teardrop notch, there is enough space for both notifications and the clock. </p>
<p> Users suspect that the development team simply copied the based system for the Mi 9 from the Poco F1 or Mi 8, and that’s why the notification icons disappear on this smartphone, as well. Right now, there’s nothing you can really do about it. But Xiaomi will likely release a system update that will fix this issue. So, just be patient. </p>
<p> Games loading slow </p>
<p> One user reported that games on his Mi 9 take too long to load. As you know, the Mi 9 boasts the most powerful Snapdragon CPU to date, so this isn’t a normal behavior. </p>
<p> Right now, there’s no known solution for this issue. Of course, you can free up the RAM, but I doubt it will help. </p>
<p> If anybody knows something more about this issue, please let us know in the comments below. </p>
<p> WiFi not working </p>
<p> Users usually complain about WiFi not working, but we have the opposite case here. Namely, one user said that he can’t turn off the WiFi connection, even though he only uses 4G. </p>
<p> So, if you’re facing the same issue, the workaround for this problem is simple, as you just need to turn off the WiFi Scanning, and the phone won’t connect to WiFi automatically anymore. </p>
<p> Go to Settings. </p>
<p> Under System & Device, tap Additional Settings. </p>
<p> Go to Privacy > Location > Scanning. </p>
<p> That’s about it, as you can see, there aren’t as many reported issues with the Xiaomi Mi 9 as there were with some other devices. However, the Mi 9 is still relatively ‘young’, which means more issues are likely to appear soon. </p>
<p> If you’ve encountered a problem I didn’t list here, feel free to write it down in the comments below. </p>
<p> Note: Each issue mentioned in this article is also on the XDA Forums, so you can the issue thread for more updates. </p>

<p> I lose signals constantly and it turns back on after 10-20 seconds and the cycle keeps repeating every few minutes. This is a huge issue. People can not call me during those time either. Xiaomi must look into this asap before getting massive recalls </p>

<p> This is my first and LAST Xiaomi phone. I am consistently facing issues: WIFI connected but no internet, The Proximity Sensor and the Light Sensor are not working out of the box, therefore, Auto-Screen Brightness not working. Notifications I was able to fix by rooting my phone and installing RevengeOS 9.6.23 for MIUI. RevengeOS retains MIUI but adds very useful fearures. In Options, just say to black ou the notch area and all Notifications work fine. I have never such a buggy device and you say other Xiaomi phones are even worse. I had to debloat a lot of junk… Read more » </p>

<p> I had a problem with Auto-Screen Bightness not working. Apparently, it was my new SPIGEN TPU Case which craused the Proximity Senor to malfunction. </p>
<p> Well, it was not the Spigen case after all, the Light and Proximity sensors are broken out of the box! </p>
<p> Well at first I though so but it was not the case. Buggy phone. </p>

<p> Hi – I have the problem that the phone sometimes does not connect to the Internet in the 4G network. Only when I make a call or get, the device finds back into the net. It happens especially when I’m on the road and come past different antennas. The sellers and the telephone company are at a loss. Ideas? </p>
<p> This has been reported elsewhere too – see the Mi 9 forum on XDA – I have this issue, where I lose all data connectivity after a call or after I lose and regain signal. I have to turn data off and back on, or reboot, to make it work. This is very annoying. </p>
<p> I have same problem with my MI 9. This issue is a big problem in 2019 with a new flagship phone. I’m sad 🙁 If I know it, I do not buy Xiaomi MI 9 </p>
<p> Hi, just to say that I have same problem. Unfortunately I can’t find an by solution. </p>
<p> Same here. Lots of issues. Constantly losing Internet connection. I have to return the device. </p>
<p> i m using the mi 9t and i have the same problem on wifi the internet is unstable i can t download anything big cause i have to constantly restart the download nor play online games (only on my phone other devices such as my s8 or a50 works perfectly fine with no hick ups), it seems that i have to return the device cause like this it is unusable, i had high expectations for xiaomi but failing to do some basic fonctions is unforgivable. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi A2 known issues, and how to solve them </p>
<p> The affordable devices are indeed getting competitive. After Xiaomi Mi A1 had a lot of success, the successor was expected. And that successor comes in another Android One handset called, you guessed, Mi A2. Overall, this device is one of the best in the market in its range, as it offers plenty of goods for a budget price. However, there are some minor isolated Xiaomi Mi A2 issues and we made sure to bring them out and provide solutions. </p>
<p> This is a great handset but if you’re stuck with a problem, the list below should help you address it. The explanation for the more complex troubleshooting steps can be found at the bottom of this article. </p>
<p> 1: Touchscreen latency issue </p>
<p> Let’s start with the screen. This seems to apply to multiple recently-introduced Xiaomi handsets. Namely, users experienced problems with a ghost touch, unresponsive multitouch, or touchscreen latency. These are a mixed bag, as sometimes the problem occurs due to hardware, while other times the software is doing a bad job. </p>
<p> Since the problem commonly appears while gaming (mostly in PUBG), we can safely assume that there are some tweaks you can try out and resolve the problem. </p>
<p> Remove the tempered glass. </p>
<p> Run the device in a safe mode. </p>
<p> 2: Battery consumption issue </p>
<p> This is one of the rare downsides of the Mi A2. The battery capacity is barely enough to feed the large LCD display and the Snapdragon 660. This, of course, substantially affects the Screen-On-Time on this device. However, this 3000 mAh is not as bad as one would assume. But, the heavy depletion during the idle mode is something which is certainly unusual. </p>
<p> For that reason, we have a few tips for you which should help you extend the battery life on the Mi A2: </p>
<p> Open Developer options and disable Mobile Data always on. </p>
<p> Prevent some secondary apps from working in the background. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth overnight. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Use Greenify or any other third-party application to limit the background processes. </p>
<p> 3: Bluetooth bug issue </p>
<p> Due to a fact that the Mi A2 comes without the 3.5-inch headphone jack, you’ll either need to use an adapter or Bluetooth headphones. And the latter option seems to be a difficulty for some users, as the Bluetooth won’t work as specified. Supposedly, the Bluetooth either disconnects frequently or users are unable to connect in the first place. </p>
<p> We have a few ways you can tackle this, and make sure to check them out below: </p>
<p> Remove pairing and establish it again. Navigate to Settings >Bluetooth and delete all paired devices. Pair the handset with the device again and try again. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Disable Automatic pairing. Pair individually with a device when you want to use it. </p>
<p> Boot into a safe mode and try connecting via Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Update the system. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> 4: Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Wi-Fi on this device is not exactly the fastest. In addition, it has a short reach so the connection tends to slow down gradually the further you’re from the router. Additionally, users had a hard time connecting to a 5 GHz wireless band. Besides those, the connection is unstable and disconnecting is a common thing for some users. </p>
<p> There’s only so much one can do in regards to the aforementioned problems, but we can try and improve the Wireless connection a bit. Here’s what you can try: </p>
<p> Delete all networks and try reconnecting. </p>
<p> Disable Always On for Mobile Data in Developer options. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Reset App preferences. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Network Settings </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 5: Slow RAM </p>
<p> If you look it up, there are more than enough signs that the RAM on the Mi A2 is rather slow. That’s, seemingly, not the case for all users but some who had run the benchmark tests with Antutu had quite underwhelming results. </p>
<p> This might be a temporary bug and it should be addressed in one of the future updates. In addition, make sure to disable everything in the background before you run the RAM benchmark test. </p>
<p> 6: Signal reception issue </p>
<p> As some reports state, the cellular signal reception was nice until the September security update. Then it dropped down considerably and this can affect the call quality. This also can lead to a major HSDPA or 4G spikes or disconnections. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do to fix this problem: </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Check the SIM card placement. Make sure the SIM card is active. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. </p>
<p> Delete Access Points in Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile network. The default carrier Acess Point should appear so assign it and look for changes. </p>
<p> 7: Videos reproduction issue </p>
<p> The problem with the video reproduction when streaming videos or playing from a local storage seems to be the thing. The videos come out grainy or pixelated and that’s also the case after the September security update. </p>
<p> In order to address this, we suggest taking some of these steps: </p>
<p> Clear the cache from the app (e.g. YouTube, Twitch etc.). </p>
<p> Disable Adaptive brightness. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Update the device. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 8: Lags and freezes </p>
<p> This handset offers one of the best CPUs in the rank, with the Snapdragon 660 being a display of power and consistency. However, that’s not always the case and we have software to blame for that. Or overheating. </p>
<p> Either way, the reported issues mostly occur during the gaming sessions, and we all know that some of the modern games can be really demanding. However, lags in the user interface and in the resource-easy apps shouldn’t be a thing, and that’s where we suggest some tweaks. </p>
<p> Here’s what you can do to speed up the Mi A2 and reduce lags and stutters: </p>
<p> Clear cache from the app which freezes the most. </p>
<p> Disable apps from working in the background. Greenify should serve the purpose. </p>
<p> Update your device for a possible update fix. </p>
<p> Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Wipe the cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 9: Random Reboots </p>
<p> When we collect the data and write these kinds of ample issue roundups, we tend to avoid the custom ROM issues. Flashing ROMs on their own is already a journeymen action and the issues which might occur are probably well-known to all advanced users. So, the random reboots occur mostly when the stock Android ROM is replaced by the custom ROM. </p>
<p> So, if you’ve done something similar, we suggest reflashing the stock ROM and sticking with it for some time. This device is more than interesting for the developer’s community and we’re sure that soon we’ll have stable versions of all fan-favorite custom ROMs. Including the MIUI port for Mi A2. </p>
<p> 10: Yellowish screen tint </p>
<p> The thing with the LCD screens is that they don’t have the same warmth. Some are more bluish while others tend to be yellowish. And that’s the thing, check it up. Two devices with the same product number might have a different LCD display and thus the disparity between the LCD temperature. </p>
<p> In the Xiaomi’s case, there are two different LCD displays with code names Tianma and Illitek (their respective manufacturers). Tianma is cooler while Ilitek is warmer. You can check which is placed on your device by dialing “##6484##“. </p>
<p> With that in mind, you can also check whether your Nightlight is turned on and disable it. It might be the reason for the yellow tint we’re referring to. </p>
<p> 11: GPS issues </p>
<p> The GPS issues are rare on the Mi A2. And judged on the results of many reviewers and user reports, the GPS is quite precise on this AndroidOne handset. However, sometimes it stops working for an unknown reason and that’s observable when using Google Maps, Waze or similar apps which are dependent on GPS to determine your location. </p>
<p> On the other hand, the problem might be of general nature and not specific for Mi A2. In order to resolve it, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Reboot the device. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> 12: Overheating issue </p>
<p> Overheating is another general problem, a problem which is common for all devices with powerful chipsets. In addition, Mi A2 utilizes Quick Charge 3.0 which will charge your battery fast but will heat up the device a bit. And, that’s why using your handset while charging isn’t the best idea. </p>
<p> Also, we suggest removing the casing if you enjoy intensive gaming, as this will also work towards the higher working temperature. </p>
<p> 13: Black Screen in some apps </p>
<p> Some users also experienced black screens in certain third-party apps. While one group had a black boxes pop-up randomly on the screen, for others the whole screen went black (e.g. official Twitter app). There seems to be a bug at hand and seemingly, the September update fixed this. </p>
<p> However, if the problem persists and it tackles only one app you can single out, follow these steps to try and resolve this: </p>
<p> Reinstall the app. </p>
<p> Allow the required app’s permissions. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> 14: Adaptive brightness issue </p>
<p> The Adaptive Brightness and the behavior of the ambient light sensor are touchy subjects when it comes to Xiaomi’s Android One handsets. These are scarce problems but some users had a hard time with the automatic adaptive brightness which is underperforming. </p>
<p> For that reason, we have a few suggestions for you which should help you improve it: </p>
<p> Disable Adaptive brightness and restart your device. Re-enable it again. </p>
<p> Clean the front-facing top bezel where the sensor resides. </p>
<p> 15: The device doesn’t receive OTA updates </p>
<p> And, finally, the last place is reserved for the alleged inability to get the OTA updates on Mi A2. Some users said that they haven’t got the August or September updates via Over-the-Air update protocol. </p>
<p> If that’s the case for you, try out some of these steps: </p>
<p> Check for updates manually. </p>
<p> Restart your device. </p>
<p> Wait for some time. Your device might be assigned to another region and thus the delay in the OTA distribution. </p>
<p> That’s a wrap. If you know of any additional problems or have questions regarding the ones we posted, feel free to tell us in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. Thanks for reading. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi A3 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> Xiaomi Mi A3 is a long-awaited addition to Xiaomi’s Android One roundup. However, once it was out and we all witnessed that low-res Super AMOLED display, many people saw it as a downgrade to this already classic line of stock Android devices made by Xiaomi. And it seems that there’s a whole lot of minor issues on the Xiaomi Mi A3. Nothing major, no dealbreakers (if you can live with the display), but software issues nonetheless. </p>
<p> We made sure to locate basically every noticeable bug and list them here for our readers that own the Xiaomi Mi A3. Of course, with applicable solutions or at least tips to alleviate the problem at hand. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. In the case of this particular device, based on our experience, if you like that stock Android experience and don’t mind the resolution, go for it. It’s a great bang for the buck. </p>
<p> 1. Wi-Fi and Mobile Data issues </p>
<p> Various Wi-Fi issues were reported on the dedicated forum and XDA. It seems some users are not able to connect to their wireless routers while others experienced quite slow bandwidth speeds. If that’s the case for you, try these steps: </p>
<p> Moving forward, Mobile Data issues are even more prominent. Namely, some users had a hard time utilizing 4G network capabilities. If you are among them, here’s what you can try to resolve this: </p>
<p> Delete all networks and try reconnecting. </p>
<p> Set AP band to 2.4 GHz. </p>
<p> Restart your router. </p>
<p> Reset APN and get a new configuration from your mobile carrier. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 2. Bluetooth issues </p>
<p> Some concerned users described Bluetooth connectivity on Xiaomi Mi A3 as a “hot mess”. The issues they mentioned relate to the unstable connection when the device is paired with a car, Bluetooth speakers, and even wearables. If you are experiencing issues with Bluetooth on Xiaomi Mi A3, try these steps to address them: </p>
<p> Remove pairing and establish it again. Navigate to Settings >Bluetooth and delete all paired devices. Pair the handset with the device again and try again. </p>
<p> Reset Network settings. Open Settings > System > Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> Disable Automatic pairing. Pair individually with a device when you want to use it. </p>
<p> Boot into a safe mode and try connecting via Bluetooth. </p>
<p> Update the system. </p>
<p> Reset your phone to factory settings. </p>
<p> Also, others are unsatisfied with the max volume on Bluetooth earbuds. Even at the max settings, the volume is too low for some. You can fix this by disabling Absolute Bluetooth volume in Developer options. Learn how to do that, here. </p>
<p> 3. Headphone volume is too low </p>
<p> In comparison to volume on devices paired with Bluetooth, there’s not much you can do with the wired alternative to make it louder. The highest volume is predetermined and if you need to make it better, you can solely ask Xiaomi to tackle this in the future update. </p>
<p> An alternative is to tweak the sound in-depth with mods, but the device needs to be rooted. We can’t suggest doing so unless you are well-informed on the matter and don’t mind losing your warranty. </p>
<p> 4. Missing navigation buttons as an option </p>
<p> Yeah, that’s a sad reality. We understand that Android Pie comes with its own gestures system, but Xiaomi should’ve included on-screen navigation buttons like on their previous Android One devices. </p>
<p> Luckily, you can use one of many third-party gesture apps that should allow for customization and can help you bring back Navigation buttons. One of them is Navigation Bar, and you can find it on the Play Store, here. Alternatively, you can use the Custom Navigation bar (Play Store link). </p>
<p> 5. Battery draining fast </p>
<p> There’s hardly any device out there in this price range that has more things going for its battery longevity. The 6.1-inch AMOLED 720p display and impressive 4030 mAh battery make Xiaomi Mi A3 one of the most promising handsets when it comes to battery longevity and Screen-on Time. </p>
<p> However, the software might be an issue, as some users reported battery draining much faster than usual. If you have battery life issues with Xiaomi Mi A3, check these tips to mitigate them: </p>
<p> Open Developer options and disable Mobile Data always on. </p>
<p> Prevent some secondary apps from working in the background. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth overnight. </p>
<p> Use Greenify or any other third-party application to limit the background processes. </p>
<p> Update your device or reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6. The fingerprint scanner is slow or unresponsive </p>
<p> First of all, the whole 720p AMOLED affair was and still is surrounding this device. The 286ppi and PenTile OLED matrix are subpar for some while others prefer its vibrant colors. </p>
<p> Was it worth to use a suboptimal display resolution just to introduce this novelty called in-display fingerprint scanner? We are not sure. However, it cuts deeper knowing that the said fancy fingerprint scanner is not working as intended for some users. </p>
<p> Some users claim that the fingerprint scanner isn’t working well when the Night light (Reading mode) is enabled. Others stated that it works slow and it takes more than usual to unlock the device. </p>
<p> If you are affected by this, try these steps we listed below: </p>
<p> Disable Night light. </p>
<p> Enroll multiple fingerprints for a single finger to improve readings and responsiveness. </p>
<p> Disable the Fingerprint icon on the screen while the phone is idle. You can do so in Settings. </p>
<p> Remove all fingerprints and add them again. At least two for every finger. </p>
<p> Remove protective film or tempered glass and try unlocking the handset without them. </p>
<p> 7. Face unlock doesn’t work </p>
<p> It seems that Face Unlock issues that users reported in previous months were addressed when the developer removed Google’s option and added the Face Unlock from MIUI. However, some users are still having a hard time unlocking Xiaomi Mi A3 with the Face Unlock method. </p>
<p> You can try one of these steps to address these issues, but the only permanent solution is to wait for an update that addresses the issue (hopefully, Android 10 will sort it out): </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Disable and re-enable Face Unlock. </p>
<p> Remove and add your face again. </p>
<p> 8. Green tint and other display issues </p>
<p> Now, we’ve come to the focal point of this quite good device — the display. It’s all the question of taste and personal preferences, and many users don’t mind the 720p resolution of the PenTile OLED display at all. However, there seem to be a few problems with the display itself. </p>
<p> Allegedly, some users recognized a green tint on their displays. Since you can’t tweak contrast and colors on the Mi A3, go for a reboot. If the issue persists, reset your device to factory settings. And if it’s still present, your display might be faulty so contact your vendor. </p>
<p> Moving on, the pulse-width modulation (PWM) flicker on lower brightness can be quite bad for your eyes. Especially if you read for an extensive period. Xiaomi should address this on Android 10 by replacing PWM with DC brightness instead. We can just wait and see. </p>
<p> 9. Overheating </p>
<p> Overheating is a major issue on any phone, and it seems that it is a Xiaomi Mi A3 issue as well. Users report that the device is quite hot on touch, especially while charging. If you are experiencing temperatures that go above 40 degrees Celsius even when the device is idle or barely stressed, we recommend requesting a replacement of the device. </p>
<p> If the overheating occurs only occasionally, here are some things you can try to reduce these unpleasant (and fatal in the long term) occurrences: </p>
<p> Remove protecting casing from the device. </p>
<p> Don’t use the device while charging. </p>
<p> Keep the device away from the heat sources. </p>
<p> Let the device cool down after intensive gaming sessions. </p>
<p> Turn on Airplane mode while gaming to prevent low network coverage from causing overheating. </p>
<p> Make sure to use an adequate supported charger. </p>
<p> 10. Charging is too slow </p>
<p> Even though it supports the 18W Fast Charging, the Xiaomi Mi A3 comes with the regular 10W charger out of the box. And even with this rather slow charger (for today’s standards, of course), the battery should be full from 0 to 100 in, more or less, 2 hours and 30 minutes. </p>
<p> However, some users seemingly can’t meet that charging time, but their handsets require 3 or more hours to fully charge. For some, much more than that. To address this, we must stress that you should use the factory charger you got with the device. If you decide to obtain an 18W charger, make sure to get one from a trusted OEM. </p>
<p> After that, you can try and calibrate the battery as the battery is probably full after 2 and a half hours or so, but the readings are false. Learn how to recalibrate battery on this or any handset by following steps from this article. </p>
<p> 11. Poor camera performance </p>
<p> We all know that Xiaomi did an amazing job in the last couple of years when it comes to hardware. Even the affordable budget devices don’t lag behind much more expensive devices. The camera department included. </p>
<p> However, as we learned with the Google Pixel series, good primary Sony lenses and remarkable secondary lenses that come in numbers these days (the Mi A3 has a triple camera setup with main, ultrawide, and depth sensor), won’t do much without good software. </p>
<p> And the Xiaomi Mi A3, like many other Xiaomi handsets, suffer from software issues when it comes to camera execution. Users reported focus issues, high exposure and lack of detail, barely functional night mode and other things. </p>
<p> To avoid going through possible troubleshooting steps, we suggest just simply downloading a GCAM port and using it instead. Based on various sources, results are much better with photos taken on a GCAM port. Although, the ultrawide camera isn’t working at the time being anywhere but on the Stock camera app. </p>
<p> 12. Bootloop issues </p>
<p> Some users run into boot loop issues when they tried to flash an official update via fastboot. There seems to be an error with the fastboot script and some developers fixed it and posted it on XDA. </p>
<p> If you want to update your system to the latest release via fastboot, learn more about it in this XDA thread. You can find the fastboot ROM file for this device, here. </p>
<p> 13. Ghost touch </p>
<p> Some users have reported a ghost touch issue on the Xiaomi Mi A3. If you have experienced something similar, first remove the protective film or tempered glass. If the issue persists, reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Now, if the problem persists even after starting from scratch, we recommend contacting the responsible service or your vendor. </p>
<p> 14. No Always-on Display and Dark mode </p>
<p> Sadly, even though this is almost a norm for AMOLED (OLED) Android device, the Mi A3 lacks a built-in Always-on Display feature. There’s only something called Ambient display that pops only with the incoming notifications. Will the AOD find the place on the Mi A3 with an Android 10 update? Not likely. </p>
<p> Now, if the Ambient display isn’t showing all notifications, make sure to toggle “Show all notifications” instead of “Hide sensitive contents” in Settings. </p>
<p> Moving on, users are not satisfied with the way Xiaomi dealt with the system dark mode that covers only small portions of UI. You can try to force it by navigating to Developer options, but I am afraid that the Settings menu and the majority of apps won’t be affected by it. </p>
<p> Here’s how to force the dark mode on the Xiaomi Mi A3: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open About phone and scroll down until you reach Build number. </p>
<p> Tap on Build number 7 times and now get back to the main Settings menu. </p>
<p> Open System and tap Advanced. </p>
<p> Now, open Developer options. </p>
<p> Open Night mode and set Always on. </p>
<p> 15. Adaptive brightness issues </p>
<p> The first thing you should know about Android One’s Adaptive brightness (don’t mix it with the sensor-oriented Auto-brightness from MIUI), is that it takes some time to learn your preferences. After that, it should be more precise. What you need to do is correct it every time it sets the wrong brightness level. </p>
<p> Now, in regards to reports about fingerprint reading causing brightness spikes, you can either wait for an update to sort this out or disable Fingerprint icon. That helped some users address the problem. Here’s how to do it in a few simple steps: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose Security & location. </p>
<p> Open Fingerprint. </p>
<p> Disable Fingerprint icon. </p>
<p> 16. Proximity sensor issue </p>
<p> This issue seems to be widespread on so many Xiaomi devices and it was present on both Mi A3 predecessors, Mi A1 and Mi A2. The issue is the proximity sensor bug that has completely wrong readings during phone calls. Some workarounds should help you a bit, but there’s no definite solution to date. </p>
<p> What you can do is check the position of the protective film or tempered glass and ensure that it’s not covering the sensor. After that, follow these steps: </p>
<p> Run the test to confirm that the hardware isn’t causing issues. </p>
<p> Now, in Dialer, type either *#*#6484#*#* or *#*#64663#*#*. That should open the Hardware Test menu (CIT). </p>
<p> Select Proximity sensor. </p>
<p> Place your hand on the sensor at the top and then remove it from the sensor. </p>
<p> Finally, tap Calibrate and that’s it. </p>
<p> 17. Micro SD not detected/slow </p>
<p> If your SD card is slow or even doesn’t get detected, we can only recommend to use it as the Portable storage instead of an extension to internal storage. We understand that this will limit the capabilities (installing apps to SD card instead of the internal storage won’t be available), but it is what it is. </p>
<p> After you’ve formatted the SD card, just select Portable storage and everything should work without issues. </p>
<p> 18. Bottom-firing speaker issues </p>
<p> Setting your device for the first time and testing the audio output from the speaker just to be greeted with crackling and buzzing sounds is not joyful at all. This is exactly what some users run into. This happens when the volume is high. </p>
<p> Now, we would suggest to immediately ask for the replacement as this is probably a hardware issue. However, just to be sure that the software isn’t causing it, try resetting your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 19. Important troubleshooting steps for Xiaomi Mi A3 </p>
<p> Enter Safe mode </p>
<p> Turn the device off. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and then, once the Xiaomi logo appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down button. </p>
<p> To exit Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Volume Down key and Power Button simultaneously. </p>
<p> When the phone starts, use the Volume Down to navigate throughout the menu. </p>
<p> Select the Recovery mode with the single press of the Power button. </p>
<p> Press the Power button to start the Recovery mode. The Android robot with exclamation points should appear. </p>
<p> Hold Power Button and press once Volume Up key. The menu should appear. </p>
<p> Use the volume buttons to scroll to “wipe cache partition” and confirm with a single press of Power Button. </p>
<p> With that said, we can conclude this article. Thank you for reading and we hope you found solutions for issues that were bothering you. If we forgot to mention something or you need additional help with the troubleshooting, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi A3 issues with Android 10: Fingerprint scanner, bootloops, and more </p>
<p> Android One program is, to most of the users, not as advertised. Fast and timely updates, clean and Pixel-like Android experience are selling points for devices in the Android One program. And OEMs like Nokia and Xiaomi are not doing the best work right now. </p>
<p> The latest Android One device by Xiaomi, the Mi A3, is one of the most polarizing devices out there due to its low-res display but good overall quality. However, even the display is put aside for some as long as the software is up to the task. Which, based on the most recent reports, it isn’t. For some, this might be the beginning of the end of Android One devices built by Xiaomi. </p>
<p> Namely, Xiaomi released Android 10 on the Mi A3 a couple of days ago over the OTA released and, oh boy, it is quite a mess. We brought the list of the most reported issues at this point in time. </p>
<p> We also highly recommend checking our dedicated article that covers most Mi A3 issues. Check it out here for the in-depth explanations and solutions for the most common issues. </p>
<p> Reported Mi A3 bugs after Android 10 update </p>
<p> 1. Fingerprint scanner not working properly </p>
<p> Many reports emerged about the fingerprint scanner completely fails to work after the Android 10 update. For some, the problem is that fingerprint readings are not precise at all, while others can’t make it work. </p>
<p> This is a major bug and we have a few solutions to recommend in order to fix this: </p>
<p> 2. Fonts mismatch </p>
<p> Others have had an issue with fonts mismatch, as there’s no font uniformity after the update and different fonts are found in different system apps. Albeit, this is not a bad issue as the previous one, it’s still an issue. </p>
<p> In order to resolve this, we recommend waiting for the update or resetting your device to factory settings. This way, the problem should be resolved. </p>
<p> 3. Bootloops </p>
<p> This is a major problem that Xiaomi somehow overlooked. Namely, user reports about bootloops usually include certain apps and Video Calling. Weirdly enough, as soon as they open certain system apps or try Video Calling, the Xiaomi Mi A3 on Android 10 reboots into bootloops. </p>
<p> Now, this is another serious sign of negligence by Xiaomi’s Android One department. We suggest resetting your device to factory settings as this is the only applicable solution at the moment. Sadly, it seems that even this doesn’t resolve the problem with bootloops on the Xiaomi Mi A3. </p>
<p> 4. Stock Camera crashing </p>
<p> Another big downside of updating to Android 10. Instead of getting promised improvements in the camera software department, users got an unstable Camera app. It seems that the Pro Mode is especially flawed as it causes crashes. </p>
<p> Alongside Pro Mode, the missing shutter speed control is another thing users noticed. And the stock Galery app shows taken photos in an unusual manner for some. </p>
<p> You can try and clear the cache and data from the app in order to resolve this. If that doesn’t help, consider resetting your device to factory settings. You can also use the Gcam which, in our experience, provides much better photo quality in some scenarios (e.g. Night mode). </p>
<p> Of course, before doing so, we recommend waiting for the next monthly update. This and other issues are already reported and we can expect resolution in the upcoming patches. </p>
<p> 5. Chinese language on Tips cards </p>
<p> Global support requires OS adaptation for a multitude of languages. Now, the Android One developers from Xiaomi made a minor omission by not adapting the Tips cards. It seems that all tips on Xiaomi Mi A3 running Android 10 are on Chinese for some users. </p>
<p> We recommend switching to the English language and then getting back to the native language you were originally using. </p>
<p> 6. UI animations are slower </p>
<p> Finally, this sub-par release seemingly slowed down animations and touch reaction speeds for some users. UI seemed more responsive and snappier on Android 9 than on Android 10. For reasons unknown to us, Android 10 doesn’t perform all that well on a supposedly close-to-stock Android skin. </p>
<p> Again, not much you can do except to lower animations in Developer options for the time being or limit background apps. Alternatively, you can reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> Up to this point, we repetitively suggested a factory reset to almost every problem here and we need to explain this. </p>
<p> We understand that this procedure can be cumbersome due to all the backups you need to do prior to resetting the device. However, this procedure is also recommended after updating to a newer major Android version. In this case, from Android 9 Pie to Android 10 and vice versa. Basically, different Android version requires a clean install or flash via recovery. </p>
<p> And, on that note, we can call it a wrap. Thank you for reading and make sure to report additional bugs in the comments section below. We’ll make sure to add them to the list. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi Note 10 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> For a company that is often accused of copying others, Xiaomi, along with its subsidiaries, made a few breakthroughs recently, especially in the mid-range category. One device that definitely stands alone at the moment is the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 with mind-bending 108 MP main lens. But the camera is not its only quality nor selling point. </p>
<p> But you probably know everything about that. The focus of this article are issues that the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 has, which are rather seldom and can be ascribed to a bad optimization of MIUI. </p>
<p> If you own this device and have had a certain problem, check our list and you might find the problem that has been bothering you, along with suggestions or solutions for your problem. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Camera issues </p>
<p> This device is more than a one-trick pony, but let’s be honest here — if you go for the Xiaomi Note 10, you are probably going for that out-of-this-world 108 MP main camera. Or whole 5 camera setup on the back. </p>
<p> Once we get this hardware out of the table, we are often left with the sub-par software when it comes to Xiaomi. And that seems to be a problem for this handset, as well. There are reports about short white lines in the Viewfinder, focusing issues, and blurry background. </p>
<p> Now, some of these are easily fixable by updating the firmware. You can also try and reset the cache from the Cam or, even though it’s a bit early, try Google Camera ports. </p>
<p> 2. Battery drains quickly on the Xiaomi Note 10 </p>
<p> Now, the close second selling point for the Xiaomi Note 10 is enormous battery capacity, standing at 5260 mAh. This, based on some reports, should allow up to 20+ hours of Screen-on Time (yeah, you read it right). </p>
<p> Of course, once you experience that amazing longevity, you definitely don’t want to see battery deplete fast. And that’s what some users have experienced, especially after updates. </p>
<p> We can’t say what is exactly causing battery draining, but here are some things to try to mitigate it until updates address it: </p>
<p> Open Developer options and disable Mobile Data always on. </p>
<p> Prevent some secondary apps from working in the background. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth overnight. </p>
<p> Use Greenify or any other third-party application to limit the background processes. </p>
<p> Update your device or reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 3. Proximity sensor not working properly </p>
<p> What is it with Xiaomi devices and proximity sensors? If we put a list of all issues for all recent devices, issues with proximity sensor during phone calls would be at the top. </p>
<p> This includes the Xiaomi Note 10 that seemingly has issues with the proximity sensor on VoIP calls via WhatsApp or other apps. </p>
<p> You can try and calibrate the sensor with the steps below: </p>
<p> In the Dialer, type either *#*#6484#*#* or *#*#64663#*#*. That should open the Hardware Test menu (CIT) and open the Proximity sensor. </p>
<p> Place your hand on the sensor at the top and then remove it from the sensor. </p>
<p> Finally, tap Calibrate and that’s it. </p>
<p> 4. Ambient display (Always-on display) not working </p>
<p> Since this device came out in November 2019, it got MIUI 11 from the box. MIUI 11 comes with a plethora of options, including Always-on display which, thanks to massive implementation of AMOLED screens, really comes in handy. </p>
<p> As the Xiaomi Note 10 comes with an AMOLED screen, Always-on display is definitely useful, especially since there’s not a notification LED. However, some users had issues with Always-on Display. For some, the notifications weren’t showing on the AoD while others weren’t able to use the feature at all. </p>
<p> Here’s how to tackle both of this in a few simple steps: </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Check the schedule under the Display items and try setting it to Always. </p>
<p> Under the same settings, toggle off the “Turn off when Battery saver is on” option. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 5. Themes missing </p>
<p> The deal with the Themes on Xiaomi devices can be quite confusing, but it’s rather simple once you understand that Themes are region-dependant. </p>
<p> If you don’t have a lot of themes, wallpapers, or other customization features in your region, just switch to a different region. Once you’ve got what you want, switch back to your region. </p>
<p> Here’s how to switch regions on MIUI 11 for the Xiaomi Mi Note 10: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Open Additional settings. </p>
<p> Choose Region. </p>
<p> Select India. </p>
<p> If you can install themes from third-party sources but they won’t stick after a reboot, the problem is in MIUI 11 and it isn’t solved at the time being. Available themes are just not optimized for MIUI 11 and we’ll need to wait until Xiaomi sort this out. </p>
<p> 6. GPS issues on the Xiaomi Note 10 </p>
<p> Based on user and reviewer reports, GPS on the Xiaomi Note 10 is not exactly the industry standard but not all that bad. You can say, just a regular precise GPS. On the other hand, there seems to be a bug with the location services, where GPS won’t work and the Location shortcut is just greyed out. </p>
<p> If you are affected by this, make sure to check for hardware issues by following these steps: </p>
<p> Run the 3D Fix test and see whether there are available satellites. </p>
<p> If the 3D Fix is green, a number of satellites in view and use above 0 and accuracy below 15 meters means that the GPS is working properly. </p>
<p> If GPS is functional, then there’s most certainly the software issue at hand and you can fix it by simply updating firmware. Users reported that newer versions of MIUI 11 (still based on Android 9) fixed the problem. </p>
<p> 7. No MIUI dialer </p>
<p> There are people who dislike MIUI and its built-in system apps and features and those who don’t. Even though it might take some getting used to if you are coming from a close-to-stock Android experience, it definitely has a few nifty features. One of those is Call recording in the MIUI Dialer. </p>
<p> However, since this is against the law in so many countries (recording someone without their consent), Xiaomi started shipping devices with the Google Phone instead. And users are not happy about it. </p>
<p> If you have a Global or EU version of the stock ROM, you can try switching to Chinese ROM. There’s also an option of unlocking the bootloader and using MIUI EU ROMs (they incorporate the dialer), but that might lead to major issues if you are not sure what you are doing. </p>
<p> 8. Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Touch issues </p>
<p> Another thing that divides opinions of smartphone aficionados is curved or flat screens. The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 comes with the curved screen and, although it is aesthetically pleasing, it can be quite a problem for inexperienced users. And Xiaomi isn’t doing the best job optimizing MIUI for the curved screens. </p>
<p> We can’t say that, at this point in time, there are issues with the screen like ghost touch, but issues with the curved edges are there. The only thing you can do is adapt and wait for updates to sort this out. </p>
<p> 9. Turbo Charge doesn’t work </p>
<p> Not only this device has a chunky battery but it comes with the latest 30W Turbo Charge that should charge the 5260 mAh battery in astonishing 65 minutes. The 30W charger comes with the device which is great, of course. </p>
<p> However, some users are reporting something awry happening during the charging sequence, as the device randomly switches from Turbo to Fast charging (slower one). This happens due to overheating and the phone is programmed to reduce the charging speed to cool down a bit. </p>
<p> So, the best thing to do is to leave your device for some time or even turn on the Airplane mode. This will both speed up charging while and the device will stay cool. </p>
<p> 10. Important troubleshooting steps for Xiaomi Mi Note 10 </p>
<p> Boot the device into Safe Mode </p>
<p> Turn the device off. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and then, once the Xiaomi logo appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down button. </p>
<p> To exit Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Reset the device to Factory Settings </p>
<p> Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> Side note: If you find MIUI too much bloated (too many unnecessary system apps), learn how to debloat it and make it both faster and cleaner while significantly improving battery life. Find our article on the subject with detailed instructions, here. </p>
<p> That’s it. Thank you for reading and be so nice to suggest some of the problems we skipped in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Poco X2 common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> After 2 years, Xiaomi’s subsidiary, Poco, introduced the successor to groundbreaking Pocophone F1. Now, we can’t say with certainty whether this is a direct successor, since the Poco X2, seemingly, focuses on the screen refresh rate more than super-affordable hardware. But it’s far from being a one-trick pony. Today, we invested some time in learning about the Poco X2 and brought you the list of common issues. </p>
<p> If you have experienced any issues on the Poco X2, make sure to check our list because we have some recommended solutions, as well. </p>
<p> Note: All the issues mentioned in this article are individually reported cases, which doesn’t mean any of the problems will occur on other devices. If you’re looking to buy this phone, DO NOT consider these problems. </p>
<p> 1. Missing Refresh rate and NFC options </p>
<p> The Poco X2 and the Redmi K30 (4G version) are literally the same devices. The only two differences are print on the back and MIUI ROMs, as the Redmi K30 uses China ROM and the Poco X2 comes with the Poco version of the Global MIUI 11. That’s it. </p>
<p> That is possibly the reason why some Poco X2 users are unable to locate NFC and Screen Refresh rate settings. To utilize Google’s services, you’ll need to flash the Global ROM on your device. We recommend unlocking the bootloader and flashing the Global ROM or, you might choose, Xiaomi EU ROM which is toned-down MIUI without ads. </p>
<p> 2. Google Play in-app purchases don’t work </p>
<p> Another problem related to the ROM you are running. Google Play purchases probably won’t work on Chinese ROM so make sure to run the official Global ROM before trying to purchase anything from the Store. </p>
<p> If you are certain that your ROM is Global and your device is not rooted, make sure to clear cache and data from the Play Store, check your credentials or, eventually, reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 3. How to download and install Gcam on Poco X2 </p>
<p> The camera setup on the Poco X2 is quite amazing, considering the pricing of the device. The good thing about being the twin brother of the Redmi K30 lies in the bigger support from independent developers. So, any Gcam port that works on the Redmi K30, should work on the Poco X2. And vice versa. As they are basically the same device. </p>
<p> But should you get the Gcam and use it over the stock Camera app? Based on reports: definitely. The white balance and overall color science are not strong sides of Xiaomi (and its subsidiaries, Poco and Redmi). That’s all avoided with the Gcam which brings better image processing and more realistic photography. </p>
<p> If you are not sure how to install Gcam on your Poco X2, follow these instructions: </p>
<p> In Google Chrome on your handset, navigate to the Gcam Hub, here, and download one of the versions by tapping on it. </p>
<p> Allow installation of apps from third-party sources when prompted. </p>
<p> You can download the configuration files and add them by following the instructions provided, here. The configuration for this device can be found within the Redmi K30, on this list. </p>
<p> Install Gcam and that’s it. You can tweak some options in Settings to your liking. Enjoy. </p>
<p> 4. Battery drain issue </p>
<p> The 120Hz refresh rate and the 6.6 inches LCD display are massive reasons why this device takes a lot of juice. However, that’s covered with the large 4500 mAh battery that supports the 27W fast charging. On the other hand, it doesn’t come as a surprise that some users noticed a significant battery drain. This Poco X2 issue is especially prominent after updates. </p>
<p> Now, there are a few things you can do to reduce the battery drain, and we made sure to list them below: </p>
<p> Disable Automatic brightness and set the brightness manually. </p>
<p> Open Developer options and disable Mobile Data always on. </p>
<p> Prevent some secondary apps from working in the background. </p>
<p> Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth overnight. </p>
<p> Use Greenify or any other third-party application to limit the background processes. </p>
<p> Update your device or reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 5. Missing notifications </p>
<p> The notifications as a whole were and still are one of the biggest Xiaomi’s omissions on MIUI. The system kills off the apps in the background on its own, notifications disappear from the status bar, vibration doesn’t work with the incoming calls, etc. So many problems and we are not sure why Xiaomi keeps adding new features and completely neglects the essentials. </p>
<p> On the Poco X2 running MIUI 11 (based on Android 10), Xiaomi fixed some of those issues. However, the problem with calls still stands, as the users are not hearing the ringing sound but there’s no prompt of an incoming call on the lock screen. </p>
<p> There are some things you should check to ensure that the issue is not on your side. Here’s what you should do: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Display > Notch & status bar. Toggle ON the “Show icons for incoming notifications” option. </p>
<p> Open Settings > Sound & vibration. Select any default Ringtone. Stick with the system sounds. </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > Manage apps > Dialer and clear cache and data. While there, open Notifications and ensure that all notifications are enabled. If you are using a 3rd-party dialer (Google’s Phone or something else), make sure to set do the same. </p>
<p> Get back to Settings > Apps > Manage apps. Tap the 3-dot menu and select Default apps. Once there, select your default Dial app. </p>
<p> Reset the device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 6. The Dialer app and keyboard are hanging </p>
<p> Other Poco X2 users reported issues with two stock apps, the Dialer app and the keyboard. Both are, based on reports, hanging and glitching. Those two apps also tend to crash from time to time, although that’s not as common. </p>
<p> The problem is probably related to the latest MIUI release and updating the firmware should address it. On the other hand, you can tackle problems within the app (system or 3rd-party apps) by clearing cache and data. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to troubleshoot issues with Dialer and Keyboard on the Poco X2: </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Apps > Manage apps and open Dialer. Clear cache and data from it. Do the same for the Keyboard app. </p>
<p> Get back to Manage apps and tap on the 3-dot menu. Tap Reset app preferences. </p>
<p> Switch to a third-party dialer and keyboard until the problem is fixed with updates. </p>
<p> 7. Wi-Fi issues </p>
<p> Wi-Fi issues are not exactly common but an occasional bug that comes with an update might ruin the user experience. For some users, there’s no internet connection even though they are connected to a network. </p>
<p> Now, in many cases, this might be an MIUI bug, but it’s worth checking everything on your side before casting blame on the performance of the device or the performance of its ROM. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to troubleshoot Wi-Fi issues on the Poco X2: </p>
<p> Reboot your device and router/modem. </p>
<p> Delete the SSID from the list of networks and connect again. </p>
<p> Update the firmware. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 8. Mobile data not working during calls </p>
<p> This highly depends on your carrier and service provider. Namely, maybe the service is not available on some carriers or there is a problem with the APN configuration. You can tackle the latter by resetting APN settings and making sure that GSM/WCDMA/LTE is your preferred network type. </p>
<p> Reboot your device. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and NFC. </p>
<p> Reset APN. </p>
<p> If the issue persists, make sure to contact your carrier or service provider and ask for help. </p>
<p> 9. Poor cell reception </p>
<p> On a similar note, some users have a hard time with the cell reception, claiming that the signal is really bad even in the highly-populated areas where it shouldn’t be as half as bad. Not only does this make the call quality much worse, but it also depletes the battery faster. Which isn’t great, considering how much battery drops when the 120Hz refresh rate is enabled. </p>
<p> On the other hand, this device is built for one market so make sure to check the supported bands before acquiring it. </p>
<p> Now, in regards to bad network coverage, we can recommend taking these steps: </p>
<p> Ensure that your SIM card is properly placed. If possible, stick to one SIM card for the time being. </p>
<p> Remove the protective casing. </p>
<p> Disable Bluetooth and NFC when you are not using them. </p>
<p> Reset APN. </p>
<p> Reset Network Settings. </p>
<p> 10. Face unlock not working </p>
<p> All Xiaomi-made devices running MIUI 10 and later, including Redmi and Poco series, have face unlock. Some ROMs will limit them to certain regions but, by switching the region in Settings > Additional settings, you should be able to utilize it. </p>
<p> Now, Face Unlock should work on the Poco X2 from the get-go but, being a novel device, the lack of optimization or a temporary bug might prevent this. </p>
<p> If you are unable to utilize face unlock on the Poco X2, check these steps: </p>
<p> Open Additional settings. Select Region and choose Hong Kong. </p>
<p> Navigate to Settings > Passwords & security > Face unlock. Enter your PIN or password. Tap Delete face data and enroll your face again. Make sure that the Unlock using face data is toggled on. </p>
<p> Reset your device to factory settings. </p>
<p> 11. Screen flickers after unlocking and UI animations lag </p>
<p> To be perfectly honest, the majority of issues we listed here and issues in general, stem from the lack of ROM optimization. Although the Poco X2 comes with the 120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touchscreen response, some tweaking is necessary to avoid those minor but visible initial omissions. </p>
<p> Some users have experienced a screen flicker when the device is unlocked, during that short transition from the lock screen (or idle state) to Home Screen. Others have that small but noticeable lag when scrolling, switching between apps, etc. We can agree that this doesn’t go well with the aforementioned enhancements this device has. </p>
<p> Now, we are sure Poco will deal with these issues eventually through updates. But, for the time being, check these steps to reduce flickers and lags on your Poco X2: </p>
<p> Lower animations in Developer options. </p>
<p> Disable live wallpapers on Home and Lock screens. </p>
<p> Stick to the stock launcher. </p>
<p> 12. Common troubleshooting steps for Xiaomi Poco X2 </p>
<p> Tap All specs and tap 7 times on the Build number. </p>
<p> Then navigate to Additional Settings > Developer options. </p>
<p> Boot the device into Safe Mode </p>
<p> Turn the device off. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button and then, once the Xiaomi logo appears, release the Power button and press and hold the Volume Down button. </p>
<p> To exit Safe mode, just reboot your device again. </p>
<p> Wipe cache partition </p>
<p> Power off your device. </p>
<p> Press and hold the Power button + Volume Up until the MI welcome screen appears. Let go of the Power button and keep holding the Volume Up button. </p>
<p> Once you get into the Recovery mode, use Volume buttons to get to the Wipe Cache Partition option. Press the Power button to confirm the selection. </p>
<p> Reset the device to Factory Settings </p>
<p> Backup all important data to Google Drive, your PC, or external storage. </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> Choose My device. </p>
<p> Open Backup & reset. </p>
<p> Choose Erase all data (factory reset). </p>
<p> Tap Erase all data and confirm the selection when prompted. </p>
<p> Side note: If you find MIUI too much bloated (too many unnecessary system apps), learn how to debloat it and make it both faster and cleaner while significantly improving battery life. Find our article on the subject with detailed instructions, here. </p>
<p> That’s it. Thank you for reading and we hope this article shed some light on emerging issues that bother Poco X2 users. In case you are aware of some alternative solutions or have additional issues to share, make sure to do so in the comments section below. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>

<p> How to fix Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 microphone issues </p>
<p> Xiaomi is taking over. The Chinese manufacturer has been producing some great mid-budget handheld devices and receives critical acclaim from both professionals and customers. Additionally, MIUI, the Android-based OS, works as good as you would expect. </p>
<p> However, same as Android, it has its known issues. One of the most reported issues is related to the microphone. Or better, mics. That goes for multiple Xiaomi models, but today we’ll try to address the most popular one. </p>
<p> Of course, we are talking about the Redmi Note 3. This specific device packs two microphones. In theory, they should improve sound but it seems that is not the case always. Somehow they occasionally provoke low sound quality, both in-call and while recording. Nonetheless, there are a few solutions available for this issue. We collected most useful ones, with the hope to help you overcome this problem. </p>
<p> Disable Google Now </p>
<p> Xiaomi’s MIUI stands shoulder to shoulder with the Android operating system. For global market, they offer a quite clean system without excessive bloatware. Also, they implemented a lot of Android features. However, implementing and optimizing those features are two things apart. Google Assistant (Google Now) is a known culprit for the mic issues and you should disable it. </p>
<p> Tap Search & Now. </p>
<p> Choose Voice. </p>
<p> Tap OK Google detection. </p>
<p> Have in mind that this is just a temporary solution and that it should be permanently resolved with future updates. Then you can use your smart assistant in a seamless fashion. </p>
<p> Update your Firmware </p>
<p> Behind MIUI we have a group of knowledgeable enthusiasts and technicians that work hard for top results. Some of the better-known companies have to look up to this guys. However, for better or worse, updates are not functioning the same way as on Android. You’ll need to download ROM and upgrade with it, rather than download and install updates directly from update servers. Moreover, this way you’ll need to backup your data since everything from the internal memory will be wiped out. </p>
<p> Select the ROM you’ve transferred from PC. </p>
<p> The upgrade should start and you’ll be prompted to confirm. </p>
<p> After the process is finished, start your device and test the microphone. </p>
<p> Use SoundAbout app to configure the mic </p>
<p> One of the temporary solutions is Sound About app from the Play Store. With this app, you can configure speakers and microphones. Additionally, and that is related to this problem, you can disable secondary microphone and therefore temporary improve the in-call sound quality. </p>
<p> Those were our solutions. As we already stated, they are just temporary workarounds until the developers fix the code. In case you have any questions or remarks, do tell us in the comments section. Or reach us out on Twitter. We look forward to helping you. </p>
<p> I have Redmi Note 3. my phone suddenly stopped all the speakers and mic. I can’t call or receive any call, if I do so my mobile automatically restarts. also if I restart mobile while charger is connected it’s speaker phone and mic and calling every thing start working until charger is connected. will you please give me the solution. </p>

<p> YouTube for Android: Common error messages and fixes </p>
<p> You probably already hate the YouTube app for Android enough. Mostly because it doesn’t allow you to play videos in the background and save them for online watching. But add an error message that prevents you from even playing videos on top of that. And you’ve got yourself a recipe for disaster. </p>
<p> Although I can’t tell you how to play videos in the background (there are a couple of ways tho, but it’s simply not worth it), I can at least try to help with these annoying error messages. </p>
<p> In this article, I concluded a list of the most common error messages YouTube users are getting on Android phones. Maybe you’ll find the problem that’s been bothering you these days. So, keep reading this article, and just maybe, you’ll find the solution you’re looking for. </p>
<p> Most common YouTube errors and how to solve them (Android) </p>
<p> These errors usually tell you that YouTube is not able to connect to the internet right now. Naturally, you would assume there’s indeed something wrong with your network connection. But in most cases, your connection is fine, and it is YouTube that can’t access it. </p>
<p> The internet connection issues are usually followed by these error messages: </p>
<p> “There is no network connection right now (Retry)” </p>
<p> “There is no network connection right now. Please try again later (Retry)” </p>
<p> “Please check your network connection (Retry)” </p>
<p> “No Connection” </p>
<p> “An error occurred while performing this operation” </p>
<p> “Oops! Something went wrong” </p>
<p> Although these errors may look scary at first, the troubleshooting process is rather easy. Most of the time, all you need to do is just perform a generic thing, and the problem will likely go away. </p>
<p> Search for YouTube. </p>
<p> If the update is available, tap Update. </p>
<p> After all, maybe the internet connection is indeed the problem here. So, if you’re not able to connect to the internet using some other app, investigate the problem further. For a start, check out this article for some initial troubleshooting steps. </p>
<p> Update your OS </p>
<p> Android updates are a strange kind. Even though updates are supposed to resolve the issue, it’s quite common for a certain update to disrupt something inside your system. And unfortunately, the only solution in these cases is to simply wait for another update. So, check for updates frequently, and hopefully, the fix will arrive. </p>
<p> That’s about it, as you can see most of these issues are quite harmless, and you can resolve them with the simplest troubleshooting methods. </p>

<p> YouTube Music common issues and how to solve them </p>
<p> If not for the YouTube Premium plan advantages and the fact that Google is discontinuing Google Play Music, many users would probably avoid YouTube Music like a plague. It’s not that Google’s music streaming service is bad per se, it’s just not good enough in succeeding Google Play Music (great Music Locker and ease-of-use) or competing with Spotify (better recommendations, UI. </p>
<p> Many premium users reported a plethora of issues, most of them being development shortcomings, and they feel like beta-testers for a service that’s soon going to become the only option. There’s a whole Reddit thread (thanks to user u/Bloody Mess and sub’s community) that covers all major issues. You can check it out, here. Hopefully, Google’s department is checking them, as well. </p>
<p> In the meantime, we listed the most prominent problems and, where possible, offered some solutions. Check them out below. </p>
<p> 1. Can’t upload music to YouTube Music </p>
<p> One of the biggest advantages of soon-to-be discontinued Google Play Music was the Music Locker with an astounding 50.000 tracks limit. Many music aficionados enjoyed purchasing music or digitalizing their music collection and making it accessible on a plethora of devices. </p>
<p> Sadly, Google decided to get rid of the classical app and replace it with YouTube-like music-streaming oriented YouTube Music. Now, Google guaranteed a safe transition, with the Music Transfer option that allows users to move their GPM libraries to YouTube Music. </p>
<p> And that was a painful experience, giving so many users, making old users (many of them early-adopters) started hating the successor from the get-go. Now, YouTube Music allows for the uploading of 100.000 tracks but the streaming quality is capped at AAC at 256kbps (allegedly equivalent to MP3 at 320kbps). With a catch as non-premium users are stuck at AAC at 128kbps. </p>
<p> To make matters even worse after the transition, it seems that uploading is not working all that well for many users. It is possible to only transfer music to your original account. So, people that want to avoid like-transfer from YouTube (big pain), won’t be able to do it. The perks of unsuccessfully separating two platforms. </p>
<p> Some are unable to upload the music at all, others are having a hard time accessing uploaded tracks while offline. Some reports state that their original bought tracks are replaced by bad copies. Also, users can’t edit metadata which leads to more issues. </p>
<p> Google is supposedly taking notes and trying to improve the service significantly before Google Play Music is no more. But it’s not really working at the moment, although they brought more changes in recent months than in 2 prior years. </p>
<p> For the time being, we have a few suggestions to help you upload tracks to YouTube Music. Here’s what you can try: </p>
<p> 2. Downloaded tracks won’t play </p>
<p> In comparison to Spotify, YouTube Music is doing quite a mediocre job when it comes to offline playback of downloaded tracks. This applies to the Premium subscription of those respective services. </p>
<p> Yes, there’s the Smart Downloads option that can come in handy, but there’s no consistency as tracks are, seemingly, interchangeable so you’ll get a cover of an original song or a different track altogether. </p>
<p> Strange, considering YouTube Music should have a larger music base than Google Play Music. It might, but it lacks the simplicity and punctuality of the beloved GPM. </p>
<p> Now, it seems that some users can’t play downloaded tracks. This issue is not as common and definitely not an underlying problem as it’s probably individual. Firstly, make sure that Storage permission is granted to YouTube Music. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can delete all downloaded tracks and try downloading them again. Finally, reinstalling the app might help, as well (if the previous steps failed). </p>
<p> 3. The app crashes </p>
<p> The instability of a Google app on the Google-powered OS is completely intolerable. Reports state that YouTube Music is crashing for some, while its perma-loading for others even with a stable internet connection. </p>
<p> If this seems to be the case for you, make sure to update the app or reinstall it. This will delete all downloaded tracks but, don’t worry, the app keeps track of them so they’ll be auto-downloaded the next time you install the app and sign in. </p>
<p> 4. Google Cast not working </p>
<p> Being unable to cast uploaded tracks if you are not a paying customer is another distinction from the OG Google’s music service. Sadly, even premium users are unable to use casting to smart speakers, as Google Cast is unstable and not even remotely (no pun intended) close to Spotify Connect. </p>
<p> For starters, you need to assure that your Wi-Fi network is shared by both devices and that your handset has permission to cast. Other than that, we can only suggest rebooting both your handset and the speaker and trying again. </p>
<p> 5. Missing music after GPM transfer </p>
<p> Back to transition to YouTube Music from Google Play Music which is to meet its end by the end of 2020. Namely, some users are having a hard time with the long-awaited transfer from Google Play Music to YouTube Music. </p>
<p> Some long-time Google Play Music users run into issues with the grayed-out tracks in various playlists. The licensing issue Google run into due to switching between services is a definite problem that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. </p>
<p> For the time being, the only workaround for this is to look for and add missing tracks manually. Chances are that you won’t be able to find the exact track version but that’s how it is for the time being. A lot of work ahead for Google. </p>
<p> 6. The volume is different between tracks </p>
<p> There are reports concerning the playback volume that constantly changes with every new track. Sometimes it’s too loud and sometimes it’s too quiet and the app lacks Sound normalization which Spotify does well. </p>
<p> At this moment, there’s nothing you can do but cherry-pick the original tracks and albums to overcome this. </p>
<p> 7. Can’t play uploaded tracks on smart speakers </p>
<p> This is another big problem, especially if we consider that YouTube Music and Google Home are first-party services. They promised updates that will allow this but we are not holding high hopes as the Google Play Music is soon to be discontinued and YouTube Music still isn’t a valid replacement. Especially when it comes to uploaded user-owned music. </p>
<p> 8. Liked videos on YouTube transfer to YouTube Music </p>
<p> One of the biggest grievances YouTube Music users frequently mention is the fact that YouTube Music is rather an extension of YouTube instead of a standalone app. This brings problems like pushing low-quality covers instead of original tracks or carrying over the like history from YouTube. </p>
<p> For the time being, and only if you are not transferring from Google Play Music, we can suggest creating a new YouTube channel and using it exclusively for music. That way, none of the likes will carry over from one service to another. </p>
<p> With that, we can wrap up this article. In case you have any questions or suggestions, make sure to tell us in the comments section below. If you report any additional issues or shortcomings, we’ll make sure to add them to the list. </p>

<p> Fix: YouTube Picture-in-picture not working on Android 10 </p>
<p> With the bigger screen real estate on modern smartphones, using Picture-in-picture is more feasible than ever. You can watch YouTube videos or Twitch streams while doing all kinds of other things in the background. Sadly, that’s not the case for some users since YouTube Picture-in-picture mode is not working for them. </p>
<p> This started being a problem on Android 10 as, by reports, the PiP mode was working flawlessly on previous Android versions. No need to worry, though. We have a few solutions you can try to resolve this ASAP. </p>
<p> Why does Picture-in-picture work with Android 10? </p>
<p> Solution 1 – Make sure you have a premium account </p>
<p> This goes without saying but you would be amazed how many users are unaware of it. In order to play YouTube in the background (with the screen off or on) or utilize the Picture-in-picture mode, you’ll need a YouTube Premium subscription. </p>
<p> You can still utilize the background play by accessing YouTube over Chrome or any other browser. For the PiP, though, the monthly fee is necessary. Also, for the sake of troubleshooting, sign out and log in to YouTube again. That might resolve the issue at hand. </p>
<p> Solution 2 – Check the permissions </p>
<p> In order for the YouTube Picture-in-picture mode to work, besides the YouTube Premium subscription, you’ll need to grant certain permissions. There is a somewhat hidden PiP permission (at least on some Android skins), and you need to allow YouTube to work in the Picture-in-picture mode. </p>
<p> In addition, make sure that YouTube for Android can show pop-up windows. This isn’t mandatory but, based on reports, it helped some users address the problem. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to grant necessary permissions to YouTube for Android: </p>
<p> Open Settings. </p>
<p> In the Search bar at the top, search for “picture” and open Picture-in-picture from the list of results. </p>
<p> Locate YouTube on the list and make sure that it has permission to use Picture-in-picture mode. </p>
<p> Alternatively, navigate to Settings > Apps > All apps and open YouTube. </p>
<p> Choose Permissions (or Additional/Other permissions). </p>
<p> Allow YouTube to Display pop-up windows. </p>
<p> Solution 3 – Inspect in-app settings </p>
<p> Additionally, you probably would want to check the in-app settings and ensure that the Picture-in-picture mode is enabled. It should be, by default. However, just in case, make sure to check YouTube settings and confirm that the PiP is indeed enabled. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to enable PiP mode in YouTube for Android: </p>
<p> Open YouTube. </p>
<p> Tap on your account avatar in the top right corner and open Settings. </p>
<p> Open General. </p>
<p> Toggle on the Picture-in-picture option. </p>
<p> Close the app and re-open it. </p>
<p> Open any video and press the Home button to enter the Picture-in-picture mode. </p>
<p> Solution 4 – Clear app’s cache and data </p>
<p> The next step is to clear cache and data from the YouTube app, grant permissions again, and, hopefully, PiP will start working again. Additionally, don’t forget to update the firmware on your device. Android 10 transition was rushed by some OEM’s and it brought all kinds of minor or major issues on a variety of devices. </p>
<p> Follow these steps to clear cache and data from YouTube: </p>
<p> Open Settings > Apps > All apps. </p>
<p> Open YouTube. It should be at the bottom of the app list. </p>
<p> Select Storage. </p>
<p> Clear cache and then data. </p>
<p> Solution 5 – Rollback to an older version of YouTube </p>
<p> Finally, Picture-in-Picture might not be working due to issues with recent releases of YouTube for Android. You can reinstall the app, although we recommend rolling back to an older iteration of YouTube. </p>
<p> Follow these instructions to roll back to an older version of YouTube via the APK: </p>
<p> Uninstall YouTube or disable it in Settings > Apps > All apps > YouTube or from the Play Store. </p>
<p> Open Chrome (or any other browser) on your Android and navigate to APK Mirror, here. </p>
<p> Download an older APK of YouTube. A month-old YouTube public release should do. </p>
<p> Tap to install APK and allow the installation of third-party apps when prompted. </p>
<p> That’s it. Thank you for reading and we hope these instructions helped you overcome the problem. If the Picture-in-picture mode for YouTube is still not working, consider sending a report to the developer. Also, don’t forget to share questions or suggestions with us in the comments section below. </p>

<p> Fix: YouTube Picture-in-picture not working on iOS 14 </p>
<p> People greeted Apple’s announcement of the new Picture-in-Picture mode with delight, but also with a grain of suspicion. Theoretically, this feature would enable playing YouTube videos outside the app. But only if YouTube allows it. </p>
<p> Turns out, YouTube doesn’t allow it. Users who installed iOS 14 were fast to discover that nothing changed. If you’re a premium subscriber, the app will only play background sound. If you’re a free user, you got nothing. You’ll only see and hear a video inside the YouTube app. </p>
<p> Those persistent enough even found a trick used by Android folks for years. That is to play YouTube in a browser, preferably Safari, and get back to Home Screen to leave the playback in PIP. But YouTube was ready. When you try to do this, the playback stops immediately, regardless of your Premium status. There are some reports, however, that this method works on iPads running iOS 14, but iPhone users were left hanging. </p>
<p> Even though it left many users in disappointment, this move from YouTube’s side should come as no surprise. The ongoing (silent) war between Apple and Google is well-known. As two of the most influential companies in the world, both sides are fighting for dominance. And amid that fight, users are usually caught in-between. While it doesn’t make sense for each company to ban its products on the rival’s platform, they still limit their products just enough to strike a blow, but not enough to drive the users off. </p>
<p> That’s exactly what YouTube’s doing here. The whole experience is almost equal on both iOS and Android, but the Android version is a bit more equal. And if we take into account that YouTube even considers background playback to be a highlight premium feature, the picture gets clear. </p>
<p> Will YouTube ever allow Picture-in-Picture on iOS? It’s hard to say. The way things are looking now, I don’t think it’ll happen soon. In fact, I was pessimistic about this even when Apple announced iOS 14, and noting’s changed since then. </p>
<p> How to play YouTube Picture-in-Picture on iOS 14 </p>
<p> Where does this whole situation leave us? Is it really impossible to play YouTube in the PiP mode whatsoever? Well, as it turns out, there is a way. However, it requires some work and it’ll make you wonder whether it’s even worth the hassle. Nevertheless, I’ll show you the trick, and leave it to you to decide if it’s worth doing or not. </p>
<p> Big shout out to our colleagues from Mac Rumors who discovered this solution. </p>
<p> Here’s what you need to do: </p>
<p> Launch the Shortcuts app. </p>
<p> Click the + button in the upper right corner to create a new shortcut. </p>
<p> Tap Add Action, and select Web. </p>
<p> Under Safari select Run JavaScript on Web Page. </p>
<p> Now, tap the blue words saying Web page, and select Shortcut Input from the menu. </p>
<p> Remove the existing JS code, and paste the following: </p>
<p> let v = document.querySelector(‘video’);v.addEventListener(‘webkitpresentationmodechanged’, (e)=>e.stopPropagation(), true);setTimeout(()=>v.webkitSetPresentationMode(‘picture-in-picture’), 3000);completion() </p>
<p> Now, tap the three-dot menu in the upper right corner. </p>
<p> Give the shortcut a name (e.g. “YouTube PiP). </p>
<p> Now, open a YouTube video in Safari. </p>
<p> Tap the Share button. </p>
<p> Scroll down and select YouTube PiP. </p>
<p> That’s all, the video will now go in the PiP mode, and you can go back to Home Screen. </p>
<p> Repeat the last four steps every time you want to go to the PiP mode. As you can see, the method is a little more complicated and requires an extra effort, but it gets the job done. Now the question is for how long will it stay valid. Nothing guarantees that YouTube won’t update its website to make this workaround obsolete. So, enjoy it while it lasts. </p>
