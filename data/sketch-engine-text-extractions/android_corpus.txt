<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/10/18/first-leaks-reveal-samsung-galaxy-s21-design-and-release-date/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484695" filename="first-leaks-reveal-samsung-galaxy-s21-design-and-release-date">
<p> If you're eagerly waiting to get your hands on Samsung's 2021 flagship, new leaks have revealed a couple of details about it, showing the phone's potential design and release date. As this information isn't official, the actual Galaxy S21 may look different, but this leak still sheds some light as to what to expect early next year. </p>
<p> Based on the images, the phone's front hasn't changed much compared to its predecessor, with the future device looking very similar to the S20, including its punch-hole at the center of the screen to house the selfie camera. The back, however, has been lifted, with a new camera setup that appears to extend from the frame creating a relatively thick bump, estimated at 1.1mm. The number of shooters, however, has remained the same, with three cameras at the back, at least on the "standard" S21. According to Steve Hemmerstoffer (@OnLeaks), the device should boast a flat 6.2-inch display and measure about 151.7 x 71.2 x 7.9mm. </p>
<p> More importantly, the rumors hint the handset could be unveiled in January 2021, which is significantly sooner than usual. Also, even though only the S21's design has surfaced so far, the company is still expected to launch three devices, including "Plus" and "Ultra" models. </p>
<p> There's a lot that remains unknown about Samsung's future flagship, including its battery size and details specs. Its name is also unconfirmed so far, as we're unsure whether it will be called the Galaxy S21 or S30. We'll keep you posted as we learn more about the company's upcoming lineup. </p>
<p> As mentioned above, Samsung is very likely to announce an S21 Ultra, alongside the "regular" model. The higher-end device has just leaked, revealing further details about the upcoming lineup. </p>
<p> The images show the S21 Ultra should come with a curved display, measuring between 6.7 and 6.9-inches. The larger display means the phone would also be bigger than the S21, measuring approximately 165.1 x 75.6 x 8.9mm. </p>
<p> The main difference in design is on the rear side of the handset, with a humongous 1.9mm-thick camera module bulging from its back. The latter houses four sensors, together with the LED light, which interestingly is not part of the camera setup on the "standard" S21. </p>
<p> Finally, the S21 Ultra doesn't seem to have an S-Pen slot, which probably means it won't ship with one. It's unclear whether the device could still be compatible with Samsung's stylus, but even if it turns out to be, you'd have to carry it separately. </p>
<p> In case the above images weren’t enough for you, you can also admire the upcoming flagship in 360 degrees in the below video. It shows how similar to the S20 the front of the device is, while the camera module stands out on the back. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/10/19/google-is-rolling-out-a-huge-update-to-smart-displays-and-it-includes-a-dark-mode/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484911" filename="google-is-rolling-out-a-huge-update-to-smart-displays-and-it-includes-a-dark-mode">
<p> Google has been making smart displays with Assistant for over two years now, but they've functioned more or less the same that entire time. Some models have upgraded features, like the wide-angle lens on the Nest Hub Max, but the core software experience hasn't changed. That's no longer the case, as Google is finally rolling out the upgraded UI that was first spotted in September. </p>
<p> Right now, when you swipe to the left on an Assistant smart display, you get a single row of cards with recommendations for news clips, playlists or albums from streaming services, YouTube videos, podcasts in Google Podcasts, and so on. Google is replacing this with a tabbed interface, with separate sections for 'Your morning,' 'Home control,' 'Media,' 'Communicate,' and 'Discover.' </p>
<p> The tabs are fairly self-explanatory: 'Your morning' shows reminders and weather information, 'Home control' appears to replace the swipe-down smart home controls, 'Media' suggests videos or shows from connected services (YouTube, Disney+, Netflix, and so on), 'Communicate' allows you to start a call or meeting using Google Meet or Duo (or Zoom, later this year), and 'Discover' walks you through using common commands and features. </p>
<p> The new interface isn't the only change coming to smart displays. Google is finally adding support for multiple accounts, so you can see all your calendar events and meetings, regardless of which email they are connected to. Google Meet on the Nest Hub Max is also being updated to keep you in frame as you move around a room, and the long-awaited dark theme is finally rolling out. Finally, all smart displays will get the 'Sunrise Alarms' that the Lenovo Smart Clock launched with last year. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/10/17/google-tests-a-heart-shaped-tweak-to-discover-feed-preferences/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484332" filename="google-tests-a-heart-shaped-tweak-to-discover-feed-preferences">
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/29 2:03pm PDTon Apr 29, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/17 2:44pm PDTon Oct 17, 2020. </p>
<p> A new heart icon has been spotted in Google Discover (née Feed), replacing the previous button that triggered the familiar more/less slider for tuning its content to better match your tastes. This isn't just a visual change in iconography, either, as tapping the new heart button doesn't open any menu, apparently and simply indicating to Google that you liked a given piece of content. So far, the change seems to be in limited testing. </p>
<p> Above Left: The old button. Above Right: The new heart-shaped button. Below: The current more/less slider. </p>
<p> As mentioned, the heart button is more than just a change in the icon. Previously, tapping the dot-and-line icon spat you to the More/Less tuner you see just above. The two options do almost exactly what you expect, tuning your Discover content to show more or less of whatever you tell it. But with the new heart icon, all that happens when you tap it is the heart changes red — an indicator that you liked it, presumably. </p>
<p> Tap it, and the heart turns red, indicating you liked it. </p>
<p> We don't have this tweak live on any of our own devices, so it's tough to say what other things it changes, but according to our tipster, options to tune Discover's behavior (like marking a subject as uninterested or blacklisting a venue) are still present in the three-dot menu. But if you liked the apparent granularity that the More/Less options provided, it seems Google is considering changing that. </p>
<p> If we find out there's any other difference in behavior, or if the change rolls out more widely, we'll let you know. </p>
<p> The heart button appears to be rolling out more widely, as we've received several more reports from Android Police readers, and it has even showed up on some of our own phones. It functions just like it did in the initial test — tapping it brings up a toggle to choose if you want more or less articles on the same topic. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/10/19/mx-player-gains-in-app-youtube-playback-and-more-in-latest-beta-build/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484778" filename="mx-player-gains-in-app-youtube-playback-and-more-in-latest-beta-build">
<p> MX Player is one of the most popular apps for playing back media content on Android devices thanks to features like picture-in-picture playback and Chromecasting local files. In the latest beta release, the app is implementing several new additions including pinch-to-zoom and in-app YouTube browsing. </p>
<p> The changes are being tested in version 1.30, which is currently in beta. The video-watching experience is getting easier thanks to pinch-to-zoom functionality which allows users to simply make a pinching gesture while viewing a video to zoom in and fill more of the display. </p>
<p> There's also a new feature which brings YouTube search and playback capabilities to MX Player, making it more of a central hub for all video content, not just local files. Video playback speed controls are getting easier to access, and the update also gives more control over file management to users, enabling them to perform simple file operations like copy and move on audio and video files. </p>
<p> The update isn't rolling out to the stable channel quite yet, but if you want to check out these features for yourself, head over to APK Mirror and download the beta APK. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/10/14 4:37pm PDTon Oct 14, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/18 9:06am PDTon Oct 18, 2020. </p>
<p> It's almost Halloween again, and you know what that means: the option for spooky seasonal sounds from your Nest Hello doorbell. There's no better way to get in the spirit than some scary noises yourself every time someone's at your front door. </p>
<p> Google released this functionality around this time last year, though we suspect there will be fewer people out to appreciate the spookiness this year thanks to a certain virus that's been floating around. Here's a sample of the sounds from last year: </p>
<p> If you'd like to enable these sounds for your Nest Hello, just head into your Nest app settings to find the "Doorbell theme" option, then select "Spooky sounds." Here's hoping that Google figured out how to let people revert to the regular ding-dong sound this time around. </p>
<p> Google has published a blog post and an updated support document regarding the Halloween sounds. There are six sounds this year: Eerie Ghost, Bloodcurdling Vampire, Scary Monster, Cackling Witch, and new for 2020, Black Cat and Werewolf. Additionally, the feature seems to be available in Canada this year in addition to the US. </p>
<p> The sounds will only be available until November 1st, so freak out the mailman and your friends while you can. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/10/18/our-recommended-chrome-flags-to-test-on-your-chromebook/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484641" filename="our-recommended-chrome-flags-to-test-on-your-chromebook">
<p> There are several new features and tweaks in Chrome OS 86 that are unfortunately not part of the default Chrome OS experience. They are likely not stable enough to be kept enabled for everyone. Some of these experimental features are tucked behind a page where they can be manually switched on or off. You can find these switches, or "flags," for trying experimental features by typing chrome://flags in Chrome’s URL bar and hitting enter. Here is a list of Chrome flags I recommend trying out. </p>
<p> The following is a list of fun but experimental flags I recommend for those itching to test Google's upcoming features. Although I consider these flags to be safe, your experience may differ. Android Police and Google are not liable for lost data, unstable sessions, and other damages caused by enabling Chrome flags. Remember to hit the "Reset all to default" button on the Chrome flags page when something odd happens and make frequent backups of your session. Enable these flags with caution. </p>
<p> Android Wi-Fi sync </p>
<p> Here is a tweak to bring a useful Wi-Fi sync feature to your Chromebook. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#wifi-sync-android </p>
<p> Are you constantly forgetting every single network password that you used to connect your Android phone? Enable this Chrome flag to sync Wi-Fi network configurations between your Chromebook and your phone so you don't have to remember your complicated passwords. </p>
<p> Fix Bluetooth audio cuts </p>
<p> It's no secret that Google has a rough history with Bluetooth. While the Bluetooth situation on Chromebooks is improving thanks to recent development, many of us who pair bluetooth to our Chromebooks like wireless earbuds will know that the wireless experience isn’t perfect. The following flag may help improve your Bluetooth. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#bluetooth-fix-a2dp-packet-size </p>
<p> Bluetooth stuttering on Chrome OS has been a significant issue for a lot of people on Chrome OS. Just recently, Google is working to shrink the Bluetooth packet size to improve audio quality and reduce stutter. Enable this Chrome flag to try out Google's attempt to fix Bluetooth, though you may need to change this back to default if it hurts the Bluetooth audio experience. </p>
<p> Bring pointer lock to Linux (Beta) </p>
<p> Linux (Beta) is an operating system that runs in a container under Chrome OS, giving you access to a large collection of Linux apps like Inkscape, Audacity, and Steam. The following flag will help improve your experience in running Linux apps. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#exo-pointer-lock </p>
<p> Unable to play games on your Chromebook due to the frustrating cursor? Enable this Chrome flag to allow Linux applications to request exclusive use of the mouse pointer. This is necessary when playing Linux games on Chrome OS. </p>
<p> Tweak Chrome and Chrome OS UI </p>
<p> Want to toggle on some new flags that bring cosmetic changes to Chrome and Chrome OS UI? These sets of flags will round corners and slightly change other UI elements. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#app-service-adaptive-icons </p>
<p> Google is now testing adaptive icons to bring app icon consistency to apps on Chrome OS. Enable this Chrome flag to bring adaptive launcher icons to Chrome OS, which puts a circular shape under the application icon. </p>
<p> Adaptive icons add a circle shape behind app icons. Left: default. Right: flag enabled. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#ash-pip-rounded-corners </p>
<p> Did you know that rounded corners are easier on your eyes than sharp edges? Rest your eyes a bit by enabling picture-in-picture rounded corners. </p>
<p> Rounded corners make picture-in-picture look much nicer. </p>
<p> Enable this Chrome flag to change the corner radius of the dialogs to be slightly more rounded. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#maintain-shelf-state-overview </p>
<p> Bothered by how much the shelf moves upwards when viewing your windows in overview mode? Enable this Chrome flag to keep the shelf where you swipe up from the bottom of the screen. </p>
<p> The shelf won't move when swiping up from the bottom of the screen. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#ntp-realbox-match-omnibox-theme </p>
<p> Currently, the Omnibox color on the New Tab page doesn't adapt to any Chrome themes. Enable this flag to make the Omnibox color consistent with the theme. </p>
<p> The Omnibox in the New Tab page will adapt to the Chrome theme. </p>
<p> Currently, the language settings page looks sloppy on Chrome OS. Google knows this, and it decided to clean it up. Enable this Chrome flag to see a revamped language page that looks clean and organized. </p>
<p> Improve productivity in Chrome OS </p>
<p> Chrome OS offers several hidden tricks up its sleeve to make it more productive to use. These sets of flags will increase your productivity on your Chromebook. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#movable-partial-screenshot-region </p>
<p> This Chrome flag brings massive usability improvements to the partial screenshot experience. Enable this Chrome flag to resize or move the partial screenshot selection before taking a snapshot. </p>
<p> Movable partial screenshot makes capturing a snippet of your screen less frustrating. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#allow-scroll-settings </p>
<p> Bothered about not being able to adjust your mouse and touchpad scroll sensitivity? Enable this Chrome flag to show settings to enable or disable scrolling sensitivity for mice and touchpad. You can also adjust the sensitivity of scrolling. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#files-filters-in-recents </p>
<p> Want to save vertical space in the file manager's navigation pane? Enable this Chrome flag to convert the media type buttons from the navigation pane into file-type filters in Recents. To learn more about this feature, check out our awesome coverage on it. </p>
<p> Save vertical space in the file manager by turning media type buttons into filters. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#enhanced_clipboard </p>
<p> Want a quick and easy way to see a list of things you copied on your Chromebook? Enable this new Chrome flag to bring an experimental clipboard manager to Chrome OS. After copying text or photos to the clipboard, pressing Search + V will show the clipboard. Selecting from the menu will paste the content to the active window. </p>
<p> A convenient way to see a list of things copied on your Chromebook </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#show-metered-toggle </p>
<p> Your Chromebook gives you different options for connecting to the web. However, not every network provides unlimited access to data. Chrome OS used to let you specify if a network was metered or not, but it went away due to pending issues. Enable this Chrome flag to bring the toggle back. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#app-grid-ghost </p>
<p> When dragging an app around in the launcher app drawer, an outline of where the app icon will be placed when you let go. Enable this flag to improve the app dragging usability in the launcher. </p>
<p> App grid ghost shows you where the app icon will be placed after lifting your finger. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#enable-launcher-app-paging </p>
<p> Let's be honest, moving apps to different pages in the Chrome OS launcher feel slippery and unpolished. To improve the launcher's usability, Google is working on launcher app paging, making it easy to see where your app icons are going when moving them to different pages. Enable this Chrome flag to see some of the improvements the developers are working on. </p>
<p> Launcher app paging makes dragging apps to different pages less frustrating. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#enable-notification-indicator </p>
<p> Notification indicators add Android's colorful notification dots to apps on your Chromebook. Enable this Chrome flag to show app notification indicators on the shelf (no launcher support yet). Check out our in-depth article on the feature by clicking here. </p>
<p> Notification indicator brings Android's notification dots to Chrome OS. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#ash-limit-alt-tab-to-active-desk </p>
<p> The current Alt-Tab experience can be annoying, especially when several applications open across multiple virtual desks. Enable this Chrome flag to limit Alt-Tab to the active desk. </p>
<p> Similar to the current Alt-Tab experience, managing several applications across multiple virtual desks can be annoying, especially when launching apps from the shelf. Enable this Chrome flag to limit shelf apps to the active desk. </p>
<p> Currently, Chrome OS doesn't offer a quick and easy way to activate picture-in-picture. Enabling this Chrome flag puts a picture-in-picture button in the media controls so you can quickly watch videos in a floating window. </p>
<p> Prefer not to set your Chromebook into developer to test the Web Authentication API? Enable this Chrome flag to activate the Chrome OS platform authenticator without having to powerwash your Chromebook. </p>
<p> Want your PWAs to launch automatically on startup? Enable this Chrome flag to launch your PWAs automatically after you log into your account. You should see a new checkbox on the PWA installer dialog to opt into this feature. </p>
<p> Chrome productivity enhancements </p>
<p> Google Chrome is a web browser that runs on Chrome OS. It is the default browser that is tightly integrated into Chrome OS. Here is a list of flags to enhance the web browsing experience. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#enable-auto-select </p>
<p> Currently, Chrome makes you click and drag to select a word on a webpage. Enable this Chrome flag to autoselect any word under the cursor when right-clicking it. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#tab-hover-card-images </p>
<p> If you duplicate tabs often, you probably have a ton of tabs with similar names on them. Enable this Chrome flag to show a preview of the web page when hovering your cursor over a tab, which is useful for sorting tabs. </p>
<p> Hovering your cursor over your Chrome tab will show a preview of that tab. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#enable-tab-search </p>
<p> Tab search can help you easily find your tab when the tab strip is a mess. Enabling this Chrome flag will put a handy dropdown arrow next to the New tab icon so you can quickly search for the tab you need. </p>
<p> Find your tabs in a snap with tab search. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#enable-desktop-pwas-tab-strip </p>
<p> Currently, Chrome only allows PWAs to be a single window, which can be a bit annoying if you want to be productive with them. Enable this flag to add Chrome's tab strip to PWAs to help speed up your workflow with multiple Chrome tabs. </p>
<p> Tabbed PWAs in Chrome OS makes it easy to multitask in PWAs. </p>
<p> Currently, launching a new tab in a PWA will create a new instance of Chrome, breaking your focus. Enable this Chrome flag to fix links in PWAs. This feature is best paired with the flag bulleted above. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#intent-picker-pwa-persistence </p>
<p> Need a certain PWA to launch after clicking on a link? Enable this Chrome flag to show a checkbox to always launch your PWA. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#avatar-toolbar-button </p>
<p> If you find yourself managing your Google Account often, enable this Chrome flag to put a convenient shortcut to your Google account settings on the Chrome toolbar. </p>
<p> Avatar toolbar button in Chrome provides easy access to your Google account. </p>
<p> Having trouble hearing what people are saying on your screen? Live Caption brings Android's machine learning feature to Chrome so you can read dialog without cranking your volume all the way up. Enable this Chrome flag to try out Live Caption on your device. </p>
<p> Live Caption automatically captures speech on your device. </p>
<p> Optimize Chrome for tablet mode </p>
<p> Google has been working hard on delivering a better tablet mode experience to Chromebooks. One of the improvements is bringing a better touch experience to Chrome. While this feature rolled out to Chromebooks in Chrome OS 86, some people still see the old, bulky design. Enable these sets of flags to make Chrome easier to use while using your Chromebook as a tablet. </p>
<p> WebUI tab strip brings a better tablet mode experience. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#webui-tab-strip </p>
<p> This Chrome flag completely overhauls the Chrome UI to be more touch and gesture focused when your Chromebook is set to tablet mode. Instead of the bulky tabs that take up vertical space, the new WebUI tab strips tuck the tabs in a convenient button reminiscent of the Chrome tabs on Android. Alternatively, you can swipe down from the top to reveal your tabs. Enable this flag to improve the Chrome tablet mode experience on Chrome. </p>
<p> This Chrome flag brings better integration to Chrome OS by allowing you to drag tabs out of Chrome while your Chromebook is using WebUI tab strips. Enable this flag to improve the tab dragging experience. </p>
<p> Improve scrolling in Chrome </p>
<p> Does scrolling feel rough when browsing through webpages using Chrome? Thanks to the Microsoft Edge developers, the scrolling experience will be much smoother with flags. These flags should be enabled together. </p>
<p> This Chrome flag changes the touch inertia in Chrome to behave similarly to Microsoft's Edge browser. Enable it to smooth the flinging experience. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#percent-based-scrolling </p>
<p> As the next step in porting Microsoft Edge's scrolling improvements into Chrome, the Edge developers introduce percent-based mouse scrolling. This system fixes an issue where free-floating scroll wheels (like on a Logitech MX Master) would not correctly scroll. Enable it to fix free-floating scroll on Chrome OS. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#impulse-scroll-animations </p>
<p> Impulse scroll animations are a new system to change the dynamics of the scroll momentum. Enable this Chrome flag to make scrolling feel more responsive to your Chromebook. </p>
<p> Impulse scroll animation changes the scroll momentum. Left: with impulse scroll animation. Right: without impulse scroll animation. </p>
<p> Get better performance on Chrome OS </p>
<p> Working with a slow machine can be frustrating, especially when the battery doesn’t last very long. One of your Chromebook's strengths is its lightweight nature, making the system feel more nimble than most. There are a few flags you can adjust to help optimize your Chromebook even further. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#enable-background-blur </p>
<p> Are you frustrated with how stuttery the Chrome OS launcher is on your Chromebook? Rendering blur is computationally more demanding compared to a layer that has transparency. Disable this feature flag to turn off blur in the launcher and shelf so your Chromebook will feel smoother. Keep in mind that the shelf quick settings may be slightly hard to read when opening it over a busy background. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#scheduler-configuration </p>
<p> Although hyperthreading was switched on for a few people using an Intel-based Chromebook, it's still disabled on some devices thanks to an MDS vulnerability with the CPU. You can manually enable hyperthreading with this Chrome flag, but Chrome OS will force it off even with this flag enabled if you launch Linux (Beta). </p>
<p> Improve Chrome's performance </p>
<p> The Chrome web browser is designed to be agile and robust, but some people complain about its performance on their Chromebook. These sets of flags should slightly improve Chrome's performance. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#enable-service-worker-on-ui </p>
<p> Laggy scrolling performance while Chrome is under load? Enable this Chrome flag to move a portion of the service worker code in the browser process from the IO thread to the UI thread. This is part of a big initiative to simplify Chrome’s IO threads, which can boost performance. </p>
<p> Sluggish video calling performance? Previously, the display compositor would be updating more frequently than the video stream. This Chrome flag resolves the composition rate to adjust based on the video’s actual framerate. Enable it to improve WebRTC performance while saving battery. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#turn-off-streaming-media-caching </p>
<p> Previously, media content was cached to disk during acquisition and playback. Keeping the disk active during this process increases power consumption and can prevent certain lower-power modes from being engaged in the operating system. Enable this Chrome flag to prevent caching certain media content to disk to improve users' device battery life. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#tab-groups-collapse-freezing </p>
<p> Running into performance hitches when you have several Chrome tabs opened in tab groups? Enable this Chrome flag to optimize Chrome's performance by sleeping the tabs inside a tab group after collapsing it. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#intensive-wake-up-throttling </p>
<p> A lot of websites use Javascript timers for functions that don't really matter when a page is in the background (like tracking user interaction) and keeping the CPU awake when it doesn't need to be. Chromium devs worked to mitigate that by limiting the number of wakeups from Javascript timers, helping to extend battery life in the process. Previous versions of Chrome limited Javascripts timers to wake up once per second. Enabling this Chrome flag will further slow Javascript timers to wake up once per minute, helping to save even more battery. </p>
<p> chrome://flags/#trim-on-memory-pressure </p>
<p> Running out of memory on your Chromebook? Enabling this Chrome flag will allow Chrome OS to reclaim memory from any target process when your Chromebook is low on memory. This system is better than killing apps to reclaim memory, which can cause you to lose data. </p>
<p> That's about all of the useful Chrome flags I found in Chrome OS 86 that I recommend you try. I personally cannot wait for these features to roll out to everyone, and I'm excited to see Chrome OS evolving every day. </p>

<p> It's a Pixel, and the camera is just what you expect: excellent. This may have the best wide-angle I've ever used on a phone. </p>
<p> Battery life </p>
<p> Lasts a long, long time on a charge. </p>
<p> Software </p>
<p> The Pixel experience is great, and I'd straight-up pay a subscription to get features like Automatic Call Screen on another phone. You also get prompt monthly security updates and the fastest Android version updates out there. </p>
<p> Screen </p>
<p> It's not 90Hz+, but it's very uniform and gets bright enough and dim enough. </p>
<p> Price </p>
<p> $500 is good for the hardware. </p>
<p> The Not So Good </p>
<p> Materials </p>
<p> It doesn't really matter, but plastic is objectively less premium than metal, the texture gets greasy and picks up wear easily, and this is "only" Gorilla Glass 3. </p>
<p> No IP rating </p>
<p> Easier to forgive in the cheaper 4a, at $500, it's more of a bummer there's no IP rating here. </p>
<p> Jank </p>
<p> Though it's fast enough, I ran into more stutters and jank than I expected based on experience with other Snapdragon 765 devices. </p>
<p> No wireless charging </p>
<p> We like to see more "extras" like this as the price rises. </p>
<p> The Pixel 4a with 5G comes in two models, with and without mmWave support — we reviewed the latter. </p>
<p> Design, hardware, what's in the box </p>
<p> The Pixel 4a 5G could be confused with the smaller Pixel 4a at a glance. It has the same matte plastic unibody design, rear capacitive fingerprint sensor, hole-punch front-facing camera, and even identically sized bezels. The cutouts for microphones and speakers on the top and bottom, buttons on the right, SIM tray on the left, and ports on the bottom are all in exactly the same positions as the smaller phone. It's impressively consistent. However, there are a few key changes, like the wider camera hump, which houses an extra wide-angle camera module, and the overall larger design. </p>
<p> As with the smaller phone, the Pixel 4a 5G's matte plastic finish is a bit too finely textured and easily picks up oils from your hands. Though the plastic seems durable enough, it does accrue wear more quickly than metal or glass would; mine's already marked up with a handful of barely-visible scratches from normal use in the last week. The fingerprint sensor itself is also too shallow when the phone is naked, though that's probably a non-issue, because you'll use a case. Outside that, it was entirely reliable. </p>
<p> A handful of visible scratches near the bottom right. </p>
<p> The 4a 5G has a good heft to it, with a similar feeling of density in-hand when compared to the smaller Pixel 4a. The curved edges yeild a comfortable and ergonomic shape to hold, even for extended periods, though it's a little less easily gripable than the smaller phone. I'd consider this the upper-limit of easy one-handed use. </p>
<p> Mid-range phones always have to strike a balance when they cut corners, and screens usually get the short end of the stick. Even last year's Pixel 3a and 3a XL had pretty mediocre panels. But this year, Google seriously stepped up the quality of its displays. Like the smaller Pixel 4a, I have no complaints about the screen in the 4a 5G. It gets bright enough outside, dim enough at night, it's visually quite sharp, and it doesn't have any issues with uneven backgrounds or "green tint" in dark themes. Google tells us it hits up to 700 nits of brightness at peak and 2 nits at its dimmest, though there are a lot of ways to measure that which makes it hard to compare numbers with other phones. Sure, I'd prefer if it had a higher refresh rate or greater than 1080p resolution, but at this price, it's hard to get too picky. </p>
<p> Like the Pixel 4a, you don't have any IP-rated water resistance. While there are gaskets in its design, like around the SIM tray, there's no way to know how aggressive the ingress protection is throughout the phone without an actual rating, so better to err on the side of caution and refrain from underwater photography or phone calls in downpours. </p>
<p> The stereo speakers work as usual via the top earpiece and bottom-firing speaker, and they sound slightly different compared to the 4a, just a little less shrill/treble-heavy with a more rounded sound and marginally more bass (though these are smartphone speakers and they'll never thump). Haptics aren't the best that Google's done, and a clear step back compared to the Pixel 4, but they're marginally better and stronger than the 4a. At least, as a non-"flagship," you get an actual headphone jack — score one over the more expensive Pixel 5. </p>
<p> In fact, I think it might make more sense to compare the Pixel 4a 5G to the Pixel 5, even though it shares a name with the Pixel 4a. It's equipped with the same Snapdragon 765G and dual-camera configuration with a new wide-angle secondary. While the outward design and materials resemble the Pixel 4a, inside, this is basically a Pixel 5. Google even has a separate mmWave version of the 4a that will be sold by Verizon, bringing it almost to network parity with the Pixel 5 model sold in the US (minus a handful of Sub-6 bands). From a particular perspective, the phone would be better named the "Pixel 5 Lite." </p>
<p> In more pure hardware terms, you get 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, which is good enough for a mid-range phone to last a few years. I'm glad that Google has stepped up and realized that's the minimum these days, and I hope other manufacturers follow in its footsteps. </p>
<p> In the box, you get an 18W USB PD Type-C charger, a three-foot cable, a Type-C to Type-A adapter, a SIM-ejector tool, and the usual warranty cards and manuals. </p>
<p> Software, performance, battery life </p>
<p> Some disagree, but I consider Google's vision of Android on the Pixels among the best out there, especially on Android 11. With the number of exclusive features Pixels get, we can't quite say it's "stock" anymore, but it's probably the closest you can get with the deep changes most manufacturers implement now. And while it's very, very hard to express why I like Pixel software so much, I'll try. </p>
<p> First: The Google Assistant. I'm not as all-in when it comes to smart home hardware as my fellow Android Police editors — I don't have any Nest cameras (yet) or thermostats — but I still use the Assistant daily on smart speakers, displays, and my phone to control lighting, play music, remotely harass my roommate, and enjoy a remote-free TV life. While I can do all that regardless of the phone in my pocket, Google's extra Pixel-exclusive Assistant features are so useful, I'd probably pay a subscription to get them on other phones. </p>
<p> Automatic call screening is among my favorite features. While some of the folks calling me don't like it too much, spam calls are still a serious issue regardless of whatever progress carriers claim to be making. So the fact that the Assistant can automatically screen calls that come my way and filter out the junk is fantastic, saving me from multiple interruptions a day. </p>
<p> Although I've tried, I haven't contrived a reason to test out the new Hold for Me feature in real life. However, Google put together a test line for us to try, and it works just about as advertised, notifying you when someone is on the line, though you can't listen to music or watch videos while you're on hold. I can see Hold For Me saving me plenty of time in the future, especially with wait times exploding these days. </p>
<p> The Pixels also get Google's snazzy "new" Assistant, with faster on-device recognition and Continued Conversation. That last feature means, once you've triggered the Assistant, you can issue follow-up contextual commands and not have to preface them with the hotword either. I use it quite a lot while driving, and I miss it on other devices; although it's weird Google still doesn't turn it on during setup. </p>
<p> Beyond the Assistant itself, there are other software perks to Pixel ownership. Google's Recorder app, for example, comes in handy for us bloggers when taking notes at an in-person event (if we ever have those again). But if you're the sort that likes dictating notes to yourself, it can just as easily be used for that. The Pixel Launcher is so simple and good I go out of my way to install an improved clone of it on other phones. And, from my perspective, Pixels are mostly free of bloatware; every app they come with is something I'd install myself on another device anyway because I'm so deeply integrated into Google's ecosystem. </p>
<p> While Google's software design can still be a little inconsistent across first-party apps (I can't believe YouTube still refuses to fit in), it's generally more cohesive than most other Android skins, and it meshes better with third-party apps since many follow Google's Material guidelines. In total, that makes for a less jarring or disruptive visual experience when you use a Pixel compared to almost any other phone. </p>
<p> That is one honkin' status bar. </p>
<p> There are only a few things I don't like about the Pixel software experience. For one, Google seems to have re-tuned things like animations to favor higher framerate displays, and something feels just a little bit off on the 60Hz screen on the 4a 5G. (We touched on the same thing in our Pixel 4a review.) I may be alone in this, but I also dislike the effect the hole-punch camera cutout has on software. Google pads it with enough space that its latest Pixels have the largest status bars I've seen in years — it’s even bigger than the Essential PH-1. It doesn't need so much wasted space, and as tall as the screen is already, I don't like giving it up more of it to empty padding. </p>
<p> Performance on the 4a 5G struck me as odd. The phone is clearly faster than the smaller Pixel 4a — side-by-side with last year's Pixel 4, which has a higher-end chipset, it loads most apps in almost the same time — but it's simultaneously more prone to so-called Android "jank" for me, dropping frames more often than the less capable Pixel 4a feels like it does. We know from experience with other phones that the Snapdragon 765G is a capable chipset, and yet something still feels off at times. I have to assume that it's a software issue, and other curiosities like too-small resolutions for the first-party hole-punch wallpapers imply to me that we might see a sweeping bug-fix update land soon (we'll update our coverage if and when that changes). </p>
<p> Not as pretty as on some other phones, but it's serviceable. </p>
<p> But outside that "jank" — imaginary or otherwise — the phone was plenty fast. The GPU may not be the most powerful, but it was strong enough for some light Fortnite as well as more casual titles. Day-to-day performance was also generally good, and I didn't notice any issues with app slowdowns or freezes. </p>
<p> 5G remains mostly useless, and I usually get slower speeds on T-Mobile's 5G here in Boston than I do on LTE. If and when 5G becomes truly relevant, the 4a 5G will support it — though there's 5G and then there's 5G. While Verizon will be getting a version of the phone with mmWave, the "standard" unlocked version only supports sub-6Ghz 5G. That's the 5G that actually matters for most of us, but it's also the 5G that will make the least difference to things like speeds. Ultimately, there's really no reason to go out of your way to buy a 5G phone right now unless it happens to come with it, but the 4a 5G does. </p>
<p> The 3,800mAh battery in the 4a 5G may not be the biggest you can get in a phone this size, but Google manages to stretch it out to last all day — and then some. While I look forward to putting it through its paces in more circumstances, the phone managed just over eight hours of screen-on time over two days, and this was in mixed use with a few hours of GPS navigation as a standalone Android Auto screen, browsing, reading, and taking photos across Wi-Fi, LTE, and 5G connections. I even tested this on Google Fi, which is notorious for wrecking battery life. I wouldn't be surprised to hear that the 4a 5G may break 10 hours of screen-on time in a single day in certain use cases. In short: this is an even bigger battery champion than the smaller Pixel 4a was. </p>
<p> That's good, because it's not the most convenient phone to charge. While it can top up at 18W with the universal Power Delivery standard, and that's enough for the majority of us that plug a phone in overnight, it lacks wireless charging for convenient topping-up during the day, and it doesn't have an ultra-fast high-wattage charging mode for emergencies. Personally, I think 18W is still fine at this price, but more powerful specs like OnePlus' Warp Charging have saved my butt in emergencies, and I'd like to see more phones support faster charging speeds. </p>
<p> Camera </p>
<p> Google's Pixels are known for having some of the best smartphone cameras you can get. Even with an older sensor, that remains true today — proof that software matters more than hardware in this era of computational photography. While I still prefer the utility of a telephoto, Google did convince me that the wide-angle camera can actually be useful with the Pixel 4a 5G. </p>
<p> The primary camera's performance seems about equivalent to the Pixel 4, 4a, and prior Pixel phones. That makes sense, It's using the same sensor and probably the same lens configuration. But there is one notable difference compared to last year's Pixel 4: Camera processing takes a little longer. I'm told the Pixel 5 suffers the same behavior. It's not a deal-breaker, but it is noticeable. Otherwise, you get the same hyper-real photos with great clarity, sharpness, and a tendency to favor slight underexposure (which makes for attractive contrast). Some super detailed, super high-contrast scenes can look a bit muddy on a very close crop (like the photo looking through the branches of a downed tree in the gallery above), but Google generally does an exceptional job preserving detail. </p>
<p> This, in tandem with the Pixel 5, is the first time Google has done a wide-angle camera in a Pixel, and it delivered. My biggest complaint is that its minimum focus distance is too far out, somewhere around two feet. That's not unexpected, but it does mean I can't use it for quite as many fun shots as I'd hoped. Though I did notice some very slight chromatic aberration (i.e., "purple fringing") with leaves against the sky, it wasn't too noticeable or distracting outside a crop, and I was stunned at the dynamic range. </p>
<p> Usually, the smaller aperture you get on wide-angle cameras means worse performance indoors or in poor lighting, and that isn't the case here. Google's wide-angle camera is equally good indoors our outdoors, and it even does okay in low-light. It's definitely noisier in challenging circumstances than the primary, and even a tiny bit muddy with certain textures, but it does a great job. Although overall results are sharp enough, it's also a little soft on a crop, and more likely to lose fine detail (like the leaves on the forest floor in some of the photos above). While both the primary and wide-angle suffer some unavoidable lens flare if bright lights like the sun are in scene, the long shape of the flare on the wide-angle camera is less pleasing and unexpected. Color balance between lenses in the same scene changed a little more than I hoped, but it was much more consistent than some manufacturers accomplish. For all I know, Google may actually be doing it intentionally to take a better shot. </p>
<p> Thanks: Ryne's roommate Sam. </p>
<p> The Google camera also has a couple new features like portrait light, that lets you dynamically adjust lighting for a portrait photo after the fact. It's technically very cool, but I know I'll never use it. </p>
<p> Most folks won't miss the telephoto (but I will). </p>
<p> While I still lament it, the loss of the telephoto isn't the end of the world. Google's Super Res Zoom is probably the best software zoom solution out there, and it plugs the gap well enough. Paired with the wide-angle, the camera is now objectively more versatile, even if I know I would use a telephoto more often, myself. </p>
<p> Night Sight and Astrophotography are both still great features, and they both work with the wide-angle camera, though results are noisier and a bit streaky. </p>
<p> Astrophotography mode is still great if you have the stars around to use it. Below: And it works with the wide-angle (though not as well). </p>
<p> In short, Google made another amazing camera here, wide-angle and all. When the day finally comes for Google to switch to a bigger, more modern sensor in Pixels, the results will probably be incredible. But for now, it still takes the Android crown unless you need a sharper telephoto or wider wide-angle. </p>
<p> Should you buy it? </p>
<p> Pixel 4a 5G </p>
<p> 9/10 </p>
<p> Yes, the Pixel 4a 5G is easy to recommend. Honestly, I think most folks looking at the more expensive Pixel 5 should reflect on what they value in a phone and consider if this can deliver what they want for hundreds less. This isn't really a Pixel 4a 5G, this is the Pixel 5 Lite, and if you can live without an IP rating, wireless charging, and a 90Hz screen, this offers a similar experience at a much better value. </p>
<p> There aren't a ton of Snapdragon 765-powered phones in the US, but it even compares well against the Samsung Galaxy A71 5G, undercutting it on price with most of the same features. Samsung doesn't offer wireless charging or an IP rating for your extra $100 either, eliminating most of our complaints about the 4a 5G. </p>
<p> The more I ruminated on it over the last few days as I sat down to write this review, the harder I struggled to find things to complain about with this phone, and that's weirdly high praise. When things are great, and nothing is really wrong, that's a neutral state for a tool; it's just doing what it should. It's when things are bad, or something breaks, you can feel bothered or even frustrated. But the Pixel 4a 5G didn't leave me complaining — and that's enough to call it pretty good, in my mind. </p>
<p> Buy it if: </p>
<p> You want a Pixel 5 on a budget — it's basically a bigger, "lite" version. </p>
<p> Camera performance, battery life, and price are your biggest concerns. </p>
<p> You're so deeply integrated into Google's services that you honestly can't see a way out please help me. </p>
<p> Don't buy it if: </p>
<p> You want The Real Flagship Experience™ and need more power, a smoother screen, and an IP rating. </p>
<p> Budget constraints are either narrower or looser — there are better values at both ends of the spectrum between the baby Pixel 4a and Samsung Galaxy S20 FE. </p>
<p> Where to buy </p>
<p> The Pixel 4a 5G will be available for pre-order on October 29th (and generally available on November 19th) at the retailers below: </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/03/20 12:58pm PDTon Mar 20, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/19 12:07pm PDTon Oct 19, 2020. </p>
<p> Series: Work And Entertainment From Home </p>
<p> This article is part of our Work And Entertainment From Home series. </p>
<p> Chromebooks have been going in and out of stock over the past few months. The rise in working from home caused most popular models to become unavailable, and just as the situation was starting to improve, remote schooling caused another uptick in demand. However, there are still a few solid Chrombooks that you can get in the $200-300 range. </p>
<p> All of the models we've selected are fast enough to handle at least a few Chrome tabs and applications running at once, and when they're available, we try to include models with large screens. We have a dedicated guide for the best Chromebooks overall, but this list is solely focused on budget options that are actually in stock right now. </p>
<p> HP 2-in-1 Chromebook 14": $399 </p>
<p> This Chromebook isn't necessarily "cheap," but it is one of the few options currently in stock with a screen larger than 12 inches across. The internal hardware isn't anything to write home about, with an Intel Celeron N400 processor and 4GB RAM, but it has a robust 2-in-1 design. That means you can flip the screen around 360 degrees and use it like a giant tablet. </p>
<p> The main disadvantage here is that the 14-inch display only has a resolution of 1366 x 768, so it won't be quite as crisp as the screen on the currently-unavailable Samsung Chromebook 4+. Still, there are so few choices for Chromebooks right now that this is one of the best options for a 14" model. </p>
<p> Samsung Chromebook 4+: $299 </p>
<p> The Samsung Chromebook 4+ is one of the best deals in the Chromebook market... when it's not out of stock, that is. While the laptop doesn't have a touch screen or 2-in-1 design, it does have a competent Intel Celeron N4000 processor and 4GB RAM. The main selling point here is the 15.6-inch 1080p screen, which has a higher resolution that most other laptops in (or slightly above) this price range. </p>
<p> This model is usually available at several retail stores, but Best Buy seems to be the only one with stock at the moment. The Samsung Chromebook 4+ is scheduled to receive Chrome OS updates until June 2026. </p>
<p> Lenovo Chromebook Duet: $249 </p>
<p> If you're in the market for something compact and easily portable, look no further than the Lenovo Chromebook Duet. It's a Chrome OS tablet with a detachable keyboard, so when you're done with your work for the day, you can take off the keyboard for easier touchscreen use. </p>
<p> The entry-level model currently available has a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB RAM, and 64GB of internal storage. It's one of the few 10-inch Chromebooks with a full HD display, and it even supports stylus input. The tablet will receive updates until June 2028, and if you're on the fence, check out our review. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/10/19/upgrade-your-phones-wardrobe-with-50-off-googles-fabric-cases-for-the-pixel-4-and-3a/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484539" filename="upgrade-your-phones-wardrobe-with-50-off-googles-fabric-cases-for-the-pixel-4-and-3a">
<p> Google tends to play it safe when it comes to the design of its Pixel lineup, but that doesn't mean Pixel owners have to settle for a boring look. While most folks wouldn't consider Google's hardware design very exciting, there's no denying that the company's official fabric cases look a lot more fetching. And right now, the Google Store is offering 50% off Pixel 4 and Pixel 3a fabric cases, dropping the price to just $20. </p>
<p> With exclusive fabrics that are designed and knit to perfectly fit your Pixel, there aren't many options as attractive as these out there. The have a soft microfiber lining inside to cushion the phone against scratches, and the edges of the case are raised to provide peace-of-mind if you're a frequent phone fumbler. </p>
<p> $40 is a lot of money for a case, but $20 for these official fabric cases is practically a no-brainer. </p>
<p> The latest Pixel phones kicked Active Edge to the curb, but the Pixel 4 and 3a still support squeezing to activate the Assistant, and these fabric cases do too. The Pixel 4 case comes in Sorta Smoky, Just Black, Blue-ish, and (the objectively superior color) Could be Coral. Pixel 3a owners get to choose from Carbon, Fog, and Seascape. </p>
<p> Google's fabric cases excel at offering a fair bit of protection along with a generous helping of style that you won't get from any other kind of case. They're normally priced at $40, which is a bit too much, but $20 is a much more attractive deal. And if you're a Google One members, you'll also get $2 back in store credit. If you're a Pixel 4 or 3a owner considering shelling out big bucks for one of the recently unveiled Pixel devices, why not try giving your current phone a new look instead? </p>

<p> USPS </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/26 6:39am PDTon Apr 26, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/11 3:28pm PDTon May 11, 2020. </p>
<p> As anecdotal evidence of mail theft grows in the US in recent weeks, we're all probably being a little more careful about collecting our mail in a timely manner as we await for important things to arrive, like an envelope from the IRS (the agency sending out Economic Impact Payments). And while the IRS isn't making any sort of direct mail tracking of stimulus checks available, you can at least get a heads up on the day your check will arrive using this handy tool from USPS. It's not infallible, and it won't get every single letter, but it's about the only way you can get any sort of advanced knowledge your check will be hitting your mailbox soon. </p>
<p> Let's face it. All the phones, accessories, and other gadgets you see on this site come from one place: China. Actually, considering more than half a trillion dollars in goods came to the United States from there last year, you can count a helluva lot more stuff in that pile. Knowing how trade relations are between these two countries right now, we might be relieved about electronics tariffs that were supposed to come into effect this Sunday being delayed until mid-December. But there's been another autumn deadline we've been hurdling towards that might just make that Chinese import you're planning to take in be it a case, a battery pack, or a burner phone — more expensive starting next year. </p>
<p> When you think of the US Postal Service, I doubt that the first thing to spring to your mind is "whitewater kayaking." They're more known for shipping (and losing) mail and packages in the US. Well, for whatever reason, the USPS has an app titled "USPS® VR," and instead of an immersive mail-tracking experience (or even a tech demo for, say, the exciting technology behind mail sorting), you get a kayaking trip. </p>

<p> As anecdotal evidence of mail theft grows in the US in recent weeks, we're all probably being a little more careful about collecting our mail in a timely manner as we await for important things to arrive, like an envelope from the IRS (the agency sending out Economic Impact Payments). And while the IRS isn't making any sort of direct mail tracking of stimulus checks available, you can at least get a heads up on the day your check will arrive using this handy tool from USPS. It's not infallible, and it won't get every single letter, but it's about the only way you can get any sort of advanced knowledge your check will be hitting your mailbox soon. </p>

<p> There are many countries around the world where you can register for a Google Play developer account but not a merchant account, meaning you can create as many apps as you want and distribute them, as long as you want them to be free. Four of these countries are getting proper merchant account registration support: Cambodia, Kenya, Uzbekistan, and Zambia. </p>
<p> The debate between physical and digital books is a heated one. Some people prefer the look of a tome on their bookshelf and enjoy the smell of each page as they hold their nose to an old favorite. Others like the convenience that comes with having access to an entire personal library of books whenever and wherever they have their phone. One clear disadvantage of digital books, though, is the ability for a single company to determine when and where you can buy them. </p>
<p> After years of waiting, folks in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan can now purchase books from the Play Store. </p>

<p> v3 </p>
<p> If you're eagerly awaiting your chance to order a Moto Razr come January, then there's no amount of teasing that will neither discourage you nor help you pass the time. But there are a few factoids about this flip phone with a folding display you may not have caught right at the announcement, so we thought you should get to know some of them. </p>
<p> On Tuesday night, surprisingly ahead of the usual update-all-the-things-Wednesday, Google released a major revision of the Play Books app for Android, updating it from v2 (2.9.21) to v3 (3.0.15). The changelog, which was shockingly present from the get-go (thank you!), confused me a bit but after digging around, I finally figured out what it means. Oh, and I found another fix that wasn't mentioned. </p>
<p> What's New? </p>
<p> The official changelog is as follows: </p>
<p> Added the ability to search the text of original-pages books. </p>
<p> Added a "see all" shortcut from Read Now to My Library. </p>
<p> The Redbox movie and video game rental kiosks that seem to be at every McDonald's, Walgreens, Walmart, and umpteen other locations across the country are easily one of the most convenient ways to get your entertainment fix. If Redboxes in your town are anything like they are in mine, however, there's always a line of people. Instead of standing around waiting for you chance to grab The Cabin in the Woods, though, you could fire up the recently updated Android App. It's much, much better and far more useful than it used to be. </p>
<p> If you used previous versions of the app, you probably know that it was borderline useless; even simple sorting options were absent! </p>
<p> Let's face it: productivity suites like Microsoft Office or the cloud-based Google Docs aren't exactly exciting, but they are among the most vital applications for the businessmen in us. Whether this remains true when 2.8-4.3-inch displays are concerned is debatable, but if you ask DataViz, the company that developed the free Documents To Go app, the answer is a resounding "yes." </p>
<p> The company has just released a brand new version 3.0 of its uber-popular app, which includes numerous improvements, namely: </p>
<p> a "totally redesigned" UI (not so sure that's for the better, though; all I'm seeing right now is a bunch of ugly blue menus) </p>
<p> an enhanced file browser </p>
<p> Google Docs support (the one thing that had always been missing for me) </p>
<p> an improved PDF viewer that now includes various zooming options (pinch-to-zoom and double-tap-to-zoom), keypad shortcuts, hyperlinks, the ability to rotate a page, render multiple pages, and more </p>
<p> an "optimized" version of Slideshow To Go </p>
<p> support for password-protected Office 2003 & 2007 docs as well as support for Microsoft Office 2010 files </p>
<p> The free version of the app doesn't allow you to edit or create files but can be used for reading them. </p>

<p> v30 </p>
<p> Although there have now been three successors to the LG V30 — V30S, V35, and V40 — the phone has only been out for a bit over a year. Thus, it's pretty surprising that an AT&T unlocked version can now be had for $249.99 new, which is a lot more appealing than its $799.99 MSRP. </p>
<p> Thanks to its ARCore SDK, Google made developing augmented reality applications more accessible and streamlined. To guarantee a consistent experience across devices, the Californian giant has put a certification process in place, through which it ensures the camera, motion sensors, and CPU perform as expected. Among the list of officially supported handsets are the LG G7, V30, V35, and V40 series, which offer the same motion tracking as other certified products. Nevertheless, Google acknowledged autofocus is not correctly working on these phones for the time being, although that shouldn't alter the end user's experience. </p>
<p> Most of you are probably familiar with AT&T's very misleading initiative to dub an enhanced version of 4G LTE "5G Evolution." As the top comment on that post predicted, the "5G E" icon has begun to roll out very quickly, already hitting both the LG V30 and Samsung Galaxy S8 active less than two weeks after the announcement. </p>
<p> The V30 may be over a year old at this point, but the Verizon version was updated just yesterday with a handful of new features, including some camera functionality tweaks and additional always-on display modes inherited from the newer G7. The security patch level has also been bumped up to November 2018. </p>
<p> LG's latest phones themselves haven't been horrible, but the bang for the buck they've been offering hasn't been great. The V30+, an upgraded V30 with more storage and earphones included, was released back in late 2017 at an MSRP of a whopping $929.99. This latest Amazon deal brings the price down to a much more reasonable $399.99, though it's only available for around 10.5 more hours as of publishing time. </p>
<p> Some smartphone manufacturers have their own bootloader unlock tools, and LG is one of them. It made its debut back in 2015 with the H815 G4, but it's since added plenty more phones to the roster. Two of the latest phones to join are the G7 and V30, though only the European models are currently supported. </p>
<p> T-Mobile has resumed its rollout of Android 8.0 Oreo for the LG V30 and V30+ almost three weeks after it was halted. You'll need to be running the latest version of the McAfee Security for T-Mobile app (version 4.9) to get your hands on it. </p>
<p> LG announced a new version of the V30 at Mobile World Congress this year called the V30S ThinQ. At the time, it wouldn't commit to launching the phone in the US. Now, pre-orders for the North American V30S ThinQ are live, and the price tag is bordering on insulting. The B&H product page lists this phone at $929.99. Yikes. </p>
<p> At Mobile World Congress, LG announced a new version of the V30 called the V30S ThinQ, but it wasn't actually new. There were no hardware changes to enable the AI camera features (just more storage and RAM), so there was nothing stopping LG from rolling them out in an update. It did so in Korea last month, and now the same re-branding is coming to Verizon in the latest update. </p>

<p> v30 review </p>
<p> For years, LG's smartphones have always seemed to trail Samsung's in some crucial ways. Being direct rivals hailing from the same country, this must rub LG the wrong way. Samsung's OLED displays have always bested LG's IPS LCDs. Its cameras have generally been well ahead in terms of quality and features. Samsung was waterproofing its phones before LG was. Samsung Pay beat LG Pay. Samsung's Gear smartwatches have received far more critical acclaim than LG's Android Wear ones. </p>
<p> And when LG has been able to get features to market before Samsung - curved displays and wireless charging, for example - Samsung has become known for them, while LG gets little credit. </p>
<p> I'll cut to the chase: if your primary concern with the LG G6 was that it simply didn't seem like a proper flagship phone, I can safely assure you that the new V30 is. Its 6" QHD+ OLED display finally brings LG smartphones into the OLED era, though I do have my concerns with this screen even having only used the phone for under a day. The Snapdragon 835 processor is the best chipset Qualcomm has on offer, so that's an easy sell, and LG's included its Quad DAC in all models of the V30 for maximum audiophile authority (I, for one, am pleased the V30 has a headphone jack at all). </p>

<p> LG had this bad streak last year in trying to spin the V30 ThinQ in as many different variants as possible. One of them was the V35 ThinQ, originally a $900 AT&T exclusive before it eventually hopped over to Amazon as a Prime Exclusive. If you, a Prime member, happen to desire a V35 for some reason, Amazon's gotten into some tempting as the phone is on a big discount right now. </p>
<p> More than a year after it was reported that LG would be launching a mobile payment service with compatibility for magnetic stripe terminals in the United States, the company has finally announced the arrival of LG Pay for the LG G8 ThinQ. Though we can say that Samsung Pay finally has a one-to-one competitor in its space, it will take a good while before spreading out to other devices. </p>
<p> LG's V-series lineup has become quite convoluted in recent years, with the V30, V30S, V35, V40, and V50 all having been released in the span of 1.5 years. The AT&T V40 received its Pie update about a week ago, and it's now the slightly older V35's turn. </p>
<p> Thanks to its ARCore SDK, Google made developing augmented reality applications more accessible and streamlined. To guarantee a consistent experience across devices, the Californian giant has put a certification process in place, through which it ensures the camera, motion sensors, and CPU perform as expected. Among the list of officially supported handsets are the LG G7, V30, V35, and V40 series, which offer the same motion tracking as other certified products. Nevertheless, Google acknowledged autofocus is not correctly working on these phones for the time being, although that shouldn't alter the end user's experience. </p>
<p> It's OK to admit it — you messed up. You thought we were still in the middle of November or something, and that you had weeks left to do your holiday shopping. Well, after you consult with your neurologist about these concerning lost-time events, you can still scramble to pick up a few last-minute holiday deals, with plenty of offers still available on our favorite mobile tech. </p>
<p> LG has a treat for its most devoted Korean fans: a special edition V35 ThinQ that costs a totally reasonable $1,800 (or 1,999,800 won). That premium gets buyers a ceramic back, a nice pair of Bluetooth headphones, and exclusivity — there will only be 300 of the device made. </p>
<p> Project Fi may have many fans—after all, it gives you service across three US carriers plus international roaming at an affordable pay-as-you-go rate—but one thing subscribers don't enjoy is the lack of selection when it comes to phones. Fi hears that, and to make up for it, it's adding the Moto G6, LG G7 ThinQ, and LG V35 ThinQ to its lineup. The affordable G6 is even available to pre-order today. </p>

<p> v50 thinq </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/02/12 12:08pm PSTon Feb 12, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/19 11:49am PDTon May 19, 2020. </p>
<p> Back in December, LG began to roll out the official version of Android 10 to South Korean-based G8 ThinQ phones following a brief beta program. During this time, LG also launched an Android 10 beta for the beefier V50 ThinQ. Now we've learned that the South Korean variant of the V50 has started to receive the stable version of Android 10 as early as last week. </p>
<p> If you're a long-suffering LG smartphone owner who just wished that the company would just take a little bit more care of its software... let's just say we've resigned to a level of masochism. Updates are slow to come out and the UI itself contains plenty of outdated motifs. But worse news may be to come as some purported screenshots of the upcoming LG UX 9.1 on top of Android 10 have been uploaded to a South Korean forum. </p>
<p> LG seems really invested in making Dual Screen cases for its phones, expanding the amount of real estate available to smartphone users while bypassing the engineering requirements of a folding phone. There's one for the V50 and one for the sorta all-new G8X that just debuted at IFA 2019. But there's one detail that about that Dual Screen case for the G8X that seems particularly fishy and quite ugly. </p>
<p> LG's last few V-series phones have been pretty similar to each other, but it looks like the upcoming V50 is going to have something special up its sleeve: 5G. A leaked photo of the Sprint V50 from Evan Blass reveals that the phone will have 5G capabilities, and given the giant yellow logo on the back, it isn't shy about it. </p>

<p> vacation responder </p>
<p> Inbox has been growing consistently more feature-rich with a mix of new features designed just for its efficient interface and old features that are slowly integrated from its forefather Gmail. There aren't any obvious signs of new features to play with in this version, but there is something for the teardown archives. With the release of v1.27, evidence shows another classic feature will soon make the jump from Gmail to Inbox: the vacation responder. </p>
<p> Update Wednesday is starting off with a new version of the Gmail app. There don't appear to be any grand changes with this release, but it does boast at least a couple minor improvements. The only obvious change in this update comes in the form of a new full screen workflow for adding email accounts. A quick teardown also reveals that users will have the option to add vacation responders to their Exchange accounts, and Gmail's Unsubscribe feature is coming soon. </p>
<p> What's New </p>
<p> Left x2: old version, Right x2: new version </p>
<p> The Gmail team has been cleaning up some of the leftover interface elements that didn't quite fit in with the design guidelines we all know and love. </p>
<p> An update to Gmail started rolling out this morning, bringing it from version 4.6.1 to 4.7. We have the APK for you below, as usual, because waiting is for suckers. </p>
<p> What's New </p>
<p> Vacation responder </p>
<p> The most obvious new addition to Gmail 4.7 is the Vacation Responder. You can set start and end dates, enter a subject and some text, and check a toggle to only send the vacation response to your contacts. Finally, you can enable and disable the whole responder with another toggle. The vacation responder is certainly a welcome addition to the mobile app, considering that by the time you realize you need the feature enabled, you may only have your trusty phone or tablet but no computer. </p>

<p> What do you do when you already build some of the smartest, most capable robotic vacuums on the planet? You take that award-winning design and expand upon it. Meet the Roborock S6 MaxV, a more advanced robotic vacuum with a built-in stereo camera system powered by a Qualcomm® APQ8053 processor chip. </p>

<p> As you've sat indoors throughout the COVID-19 quarantine, you've probably taken note of all the cleaning that needs to be done in your home: dust the banisters, sweep the floors, scrub down the kitchen, and the list goes on. Wouldn't it be nice if you could automatically cross off one of these chores? Never manually vacuum your home again with the new Roborock E4 robotic vacuum, on sale right now for just $242.99 ($57 off). </p>

<p> Parenting was already tough, but it's harder now than ever before thanks to Coronavirus. Parents with kids at home now have to juggle homeschooling their children with work and every challenge that's thrown their way. The last thing they have time to do is vacuum the house. Luckily, it's easier than ever to automate floor cleaning chores with the new Roborock E4, the ideal robotic vacuum for busy families everywhere. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/13 7:56am PDTon Apr 13, 2020 and last updated 2020/04/19 9:02am PDTon Apr 19, 2020. </p>
<p> Technology has revolutionized so many different aspects of daily life, from banking, to business, and even cleaning your house. If you're still vacuuming with a heavy, cord-laden monstrosity from the aughts, your home may not be as clean as you think. Your home deserves a premium smart vacuum with the intelligence and power to leave no dirt behind — what it needs is Roborock. </p>
<p> Last summer, my wife and I got married and we moved from Portugal to Boston almost immediately after our honeymoon. It's great to have a place just for ourselves, but we quickly found that neither of us were big fans of having to vacuum our apartment. It's a laborious and monotonous job that takes up a lot of time, but it's also an unavoidable fact of life that homes get dirty and need to be cleaned regularly. Not wanting to spend an hour or more every week vacuuming up the place, we checked out The Wirecutter's robot vacuum recommendations and ordered their pick, the Ecovacs Deebot N79, half expecting we'd return it within a couple of weeks. </p>
<p> You know what's better than a robot that looks like a thick frisbee and slides around your house? It's the one that cleans where it walks without hitting walls and furniture on its way, so that you can come home to less dirty floors as if a magical fairy passed by and did her deed. But what if you can have an even better version? Yes, better, because not only it's a robot, it's also WiFi-connected to an app on your smartphone, so you can control it from afar. That's the new iRobot Roomba 980. </p>
<p> iRobot knows its vacuums. This isn't the first Roomba it releases, so it has been learning from past products, improving and perfecting them. </p>

<p> vainglory </p>
<p> Vainglory is without a doubt the most popular MOBA on Android. Sure there are some recent up and comers, but Vainglory still remains the go-to MOBA on mobile. Now, despite the fact that it has earned its current popularity, one of its players' major complaints was that it only allowed for 3v3 gameplay. This all changes today as you can now play 5v5 matches with full 3-lane maps any time you like, just like the big boys on PC. </p>
<p> The Vulkan graphics API is a big deal for mobile developers, since its direct GPU access allows for complex graphics to be rendered with a considerably lower hit to the processor, and thus a lower overhead on the hardware and battery life. A few devices like the SHIELD family and Samsung's 7 series already supported Vulkan several months ago, but Nougat now features full support for all updated Android 7.0 devices. Developer Super Evil Megacorp, which turned heads last year with its Vainglory mobile MOBA, now has a beta version that uses the Vulkan API. </p>
<p> If you're a fan of the super-popular top-down MOBA genre (think Dota, League of Legends, and Heroes of the Storm), you'll want to sit up and take notice of a little game called Vainglory. This mobile interpretation of the well-known formula has been built from the ground up for touchscreens, and the experience has been praised on iOS since its launch back in November. It's available for free today on the Play Store. </p>
<p> Vainglory doesn't make an attempt to hide its inspiration. If you're not familiar with the standard MOBA formula, it's basically a shorter and more action-packed version of a real-time strategy game where each player controls a single unit. </p>

<p> value pack </p>
<p> Considered to be one of the better smartwatches available, and my personal favorite, the Samsung Gear S3 received a substantial update today. Dubbed "Value Pack," it brings both the Classic and the Frontier to Tizen 3.0.0.1, as well as a bunch of new stuff. </p>
<p> It's been a rather wild ride for Samsung Galaxy S users regarding a possible update to Android 4.0. First, Samsung, issued a statement saying that they could not update their former flagship phone. After a community outcry, however, they responded with a different possibility - a "Value Pack" update, one that would include some key features from Ice Cream Sandwich (such as Face Unlock) but which would still be based on Gingerbread. Samsung later decided to not go through with the Value Pack update. </p>
<p> The plot has thickened once again, however: a version of the update has been leaked, and while it may not be as good as Ice Cream Sandwich itself, it does bring a host of improvements: </p>
<p> Updated Camera </p>
<p> Photo Editor from Galaxy SII </p>
<p> Unlock screen from Galaxy Note </p>
<p> The firmware, which is based on Android 2.3.6, is available for download from the links below, but it at this time it's unclear if or when Samsung will officially release the final version of the update to the general public. </p>

<p> In a tweet earlier this evening, the recently resurrected evleaks Twitter account revealed what may be a variant of ZTE's Intel-powered Grand X IN phone which we saw at IFA 2012 headed for Boost Mobile. </p>
<p> ZTE Warp Sequent for Boost Mobile (ZTE Grand X IN): 1.4GHz, 4.3-inch qHD, 5MP cam. 9/17 for $200. twitter.com/evleaks/status… </p>
<p> It's definitely worth noting, though, that this ZTE Grand X IN (if that is what we're looking at) is a tad different from the original. </p>
<p> So here's a novel idea: when a device reaches its end of life, manufacturers should provide users with a way to keep the flame burning. In a nutshell, that's what Lenovo has done with the Ideapad K1. </p>
<p> Here's the gist: the company is finished with this device. They no longer sell it, and it's clear that, past the most recent update (Android 3.2), they no longer plan to support it. So, they made a smart move: they built stock, unmodified Ice Cream Sandwich for the the K1, and released it to the public. </p>
<p> Take this with a massive grain of salt, but BGR has just let loose an article detailing what they claim will be either the next Nexus phone or, if not a Nexus, simply the new Android reference handset. Far more exciting than that is what BGR's source has told them what kind of features the phone will be packing: </p>
<p> A 720p "monster-sized" display - exact size unknown (also, goodbye qHD - nice knowing you) </p>
<p> Dual-core processor @1.2 or 1.5GHz (either a TI OMAP 4460 or a ULP Qualcomm 28nm Krait Snapdragon) </p>
<p> Android Ice Cream Sandwich (possibly dubbed Android 4.0) </p>
<p> Software function buttons (ala Honeycomb - no more capacitive touch) </p>
<p> Remember how we ran that story last week about Virgin Mobile laying the smackdown on manufacturer UI overlays? We liked that. But Virgin Mobile wants the Android community to know that they shouldn't consider the prepaid carrier a safe haven for illicit activities like rooting or custom ROMs - not that that's any different from all the other carriers. Here's what Virgin had to say: </p>
<p> "We do not endorse in any way end users using a non-officially tested operating system nor do we approve of 'rooting' devices. </p>
<p> The invasion continues! Development of CyanogenMod 6 for the Epic 4G is clearly coming along nicely, as a picture of it running has just been released as a quick "status update" on the CM forums. </p>
<p> The fact that it is actually running on the device is encouraging, but we could still be pretty far away from a testable version: no downloads are available yet, and if you look at the notification bar, you'll see a pretty significant bug in this build. </p>
<p> It seems a few community developers (@barakinflorida) have been inching towards releasing a functional, bone stock version of Android 2.1 for the Samsung Galaxy S (That is, without Samsung's TouchWiz interface). Their efforts are paying off, as this video shows. </p>
<p> The only big issues remaining lie in getting the camera/camcorder to actually, well, work. A relatively minor inconvenience, and a problem many developers have struggled with when developing full-ROM releases for phones with UI overlays. </p>

<p> According to Paul O'Brien of MoDaCo, a "very well placed insider" has indicated that a 3G-connected variant of the device is on the horizon, expected to be ready for shipping "in around six weeks." </p>
<p> If you've been holding out on buying the Nexus 7 due to its WiFi-only capability, this may be the news you've been waiting for. </p>
<p> Keeping true to its reputation for timely updates, ASUS pushed out an official Jelly Bean OTA update to lucky Transformer Pad TF300 owners in North America last Saturday after a quick tease. Now, under a week later, it looks like ASUS has provided the full firmware for download directly from its support site. </p>
<p> The download, which those who didn't receive the OTA (due to an unlocked bootloader or otherwise) can use to get to ASUS' clean Jelly Bean experience, weighs a hefty 438MB and is meant only for users of the US version of the TF300. </p>
<p> After owners of the Nexus S i9023 and i9020T got an official 4.1.1 Jelly Bean OTA last night, the update has become available for the Nexus S' i9020A variant as well. </p>
<p> Just like before, the update can be downloaded straight from Google's servers, though Google has indicated that the OTA should be rolling out to Nexus S phones on "a number of carriers," meaning the wait for an automatic update prompt shouldn't be long. </p>
<p> CyanogenMod 10 is still cooking, and heck, CM9 isn't even fully baked for all devices yet. That hasn't stopped Steve Kondik, aka the guy who puts the Cyanogen in CyanogenMod, from posting preview builds of CM10 over on XDA for the AT&T and T-Mobile Galaxy S III variants. Plus, a third preview build being posted for the Sprint version by another developer. Keep in mind, of course, that "preview build" translates into "absolutely nothing is guaranteed to work." </p>
<p> Mere hours ago, we got confirmation that the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) approved a Verizon-bound version of the SGSIII. Now, we're seeing a similar listing for what is likely a Sprint variant of the Galaxy S III. The device appears in SIG's listing with the model number SPH-L710, which has been rumored to be the designation of the Sprint-branded variant. </p>
<p> The model number is only one character off from the Sprint-branded SGSII (SPHD710), so we're pretty confident this implies that the Galaxy S III will be heading to Sprint, which is the last of the four major US carriers to receive confirmation. </p>
<p> Those who have been waiting for ARCHOS' 1.5GHz variants of the G9 series of tablets are in luck – both tablets' "turbo versions" are now shipping from the manufacturer's web store. </p>
<p> For those who may not be familiar with ARCHOS' G9 series of tablets, here are the specs: </p>
<p> 1024x768 8" or 1280x800 10.1" display </p>
<p> OMAP 4 dual-core processor at 1.5GHz </p>
<p> 8GB flash memory or 250GB HDD (plus a microSD slot) </p>
<p> 1GB RAM </p>
<p> 720p front-facing camera </p>
<p> 1080p video playback </p>
<p> MicroUSB and Mini HDMI ports </p>
<p> With base prices of just $269 and $329 respectively, both G9 tablets make affordable, yet powerful options for those looking to get an Android-powered tablet. </p>
<p> Following the example set by AT&T and T-Mobile's Samsung Galaxy SII variants, Sprint's Epic 4G Touch is set to get its own white counterpart, probably in early 2012. Pocket Now speculates that the Epic 4G Touch's white version may be announced at CES. </p>
<p> Personally, I'm hoping Sprint has a little more to talk about at CES than their own white SII, but the paint job does look rather flattering. While the above shot is all we have to go on for now, we'll be here to cover any other details that may emerge. </p>

<p> V CAST </p>
<p> Verizon's LG Intuition has long been an awkward kid at the lunch table. With a 5" display at 4:3 resolution, it's had a difficult time being accepted, much less competing. Even so, it has not been completely forgotten – Verizon is preparing to roll out a maintenance update to the device that will remove the Color and V Cast apps, fix some assorted bugs, and should improve speakerphone quality. There is one curious detail to this update, it also adds the Amazon Appstore. </p>
<p> It looks like an update for the Blackberry-style DROID Pro has just hit the Verizon update network, which will bring the current software version up to 3.8.7. It's not as exciting as a Gingerbread update would be, but it does bring some welcome bug fixes and UI enhancements. </p>
<p> Also included in this update are several Exchange ActiveSync improvements, like calendar synchronization. The rest of this update consists primarily of bug fixes, a Bluetooth voice recording enhancement, and the addition of Verizon's V CAST Appstore. </p>
<p> Verizon's announcement of a separate Big Red branded Android Market, called the V Cast App Store, sent shockwaves through the Androidosphere a month ago, with the general consensus being: "we don't want it." Of course, none of us could actually prevent Verizon from fragmenting our Market situation further (they've already done their part with the MOTOBLUR to help fragment the Android OS itself), so all we have to do is go with the flow and see what exactly Verizon's cooked up. </p>

<p> vector drawables </p>
<p> A fresh version of the Android Support Library is now available to developers. This may be one of the biggest updates in quite a while, as some of the changes demand a few significant internal changes. On the plus side, there aren't very many changes that should break existing code, and most of the new features will make it worth the trouble. Here's a quick introduction to some of the new changes. </p>
<p> Vector Drawables and Animated Vector Drawables </p>
<p> Full vector support was first introduced in Android 5.0 Lollipop, allowing developers to distribute apks with easily resizable vector drawings in place of multiple images at various sizes. </p>
<p> The first Android Studio v1.4 preview release came out just a short six weeks ago, and now it's moving into the Stable channel, right on schedule. The features remain largely the same as the original v1.4 preview, but a ton of bugs have been fixed and a few of the capabilities have been improved in some awesome ways. </p>
<p> With the official stable release of Android Studio v1.3 a couple of weeks ago, it's time to begin testing the next string of new features. The first preview release of version 1.4 is now in the Canary channel, and it's sporting some big new features. The Android Tools team has been working on the new theme editor first demonstrated in the I/O session titled What's New in Android Development Tools. There are also new performance monitors for GPU and network activity, a vector asset wizard for turning SVG files into XML vector drawables, and a few new lint checks. </p>
<p> Here is the Google I/O session video cued up to the beginning of the theme editor demo at 36 minutes: </p>
<p> Theme Editor </p>
<p> The new theme editor examines the styles in a project and displays visual samples of what controls should look like on a live interface. </p>

<p> Do you enjoy knowing how fast things are? Then Qualcomm's revamped Vellamo suite is probably something you should check out. Vellamo has been the web benchmark of choice on Android for some time now, but this new update brings some major improvements. </p>
<p> First, the UI: it's completely different. It's actually really nice, certainly the prettiest benchmarking tool I've ever seen on Android (I mean, who really cares, but still). Just look at the screenshots: </p>
<p> The next big change comes in the form of a brand-new CPU benchmark called Metal. </p>
<p> It's a well-known fact that Android enthusiasts love benchmarks. When new devices hit our hands, what is one of the first things we do? Run benchmarks. It's how we compare devices to one another, and what we use to develop the standards on which future devices will be set. At this point, we use a set of benchmarking tools that have become clutch throughout the community: Quadrant, Linpack, SmartBench, etc. </p>
<p> Now, Qualcomm is getting into the benchmarking game with a new web benchmark called Vellamo that aims to judge device performance in areas that really matter: rendering, javascript, networking, and user experience. </p>

<p> Velocity Micro </p>
<p> We've all heard of the low-budget Velocity Cruz tablets before, and it looks like company is keeping the brand alive in 2012 with a pair of Android 4.0 tablets. </p>
<p> As expected, these aren't the most powerful portables on the planet -- but, then again, they'll likely have a price to match. The smaller of the duo is the Cruz T507, a 7-inch slate with a Cortex A8 1.2GHz processor, 512MB RAM, 8GB internal store, front-facing camera, HDMI out, and Amazon's Appstore as its go-to marketplace. </p>
<p> There really are a lot of tablets being announced at CES 2011, and Velocity Micro just launched their new lineup of Android tablets as well: the 7" Cruz Tablet L37, the 8" Cruz Tablet P38, and the 10.1" Cruz Tablet L510. </p>
<p> The 7" L37 has a 1024x600 capacitive touch screen, while the 8" P38 has a 1024x768 screen, and both come with 802.11n WiFi and 4GB of internal memory. The 10.1" P38 has a 1366x768 capacitive touch screen and runs on the NVIDIA Tegra 250 Chipset with a 1GHz dual-core CPU. </p>
<p> Velocity Micro’s Android tablet called Cruz is now available for pre-order from Borders.com and CruzReader.com at a bargain price of $299.99. </p>
<p> The CruzReader.com order page is currently citing a late September release date, while Borders.com is expected to ship October 15th, so you may have to wait for a number of weeks before you can get your hands on one yourself. </p>
<p> After seeing the specs and the price, we think this tablet could very well be a genuine competitor in the market. </p>

<p> velvet </p>
<p> It's always unusual when one variant of a phone gets different specs than all the others, but that's what's happened with T-Mobile's LG Velvet. For some reason, T-Mobile decided they wanted a Velvet with a MediaTek chipset — something no other Velvet variant globally has. Plus, it has a smaller battery. Granted, this model is pretty cheap at $588, but we'd expect a little more discount for the lesser specs. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/07/21 10:11am PDTon Jul 21, 2020 and last updated 2020/08/18 9:53am PDTon Aug 18, 2020. </p>
<p> We're deep into summer and almost due for a couple of new phones from Samsung and Apple. Perfect time, then, for LG to finally bring around its new Velvet smartphone from overseas to the U.S. market. It came to AT&T late in July and is eventually going to make it to T-Mobile, but we now know exactly when Verizon will bring it to customers. </p>
<p> LG could use a win. While it once innovated with modular hardware and pushing the whole industry past 16:9 screens, it's been hard to find any unambiguous successes over the last few generations of G- and V-series flagships. That's not to say that they weren't decently good phones, but none really stood out — maybe the V40 was one of the best, but even then we couldn't recommend paying big money for it. Is it time to take things back to the drawing board? </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/07 8:12am PDTon May 7, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/15 5:54am PDTon Jun 15, 2020. </p>
<p> As we're used to for the past several years now, LG leaves very few secrets on the table about the phones it's going to launch. Indeed, the new Velvet phone was teased quite early on as the successor to the longstanding G-series. Tomorrow, it goes on pre-sale in South Korea and we're now getting a clearer look at what we can expect out of the phone. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/20 4:20am PDTon Apr 20, 2020 and last updated 2020/04/24 2:42am PDTon Apr 24, 2020. </p>
<p> LG's smartphone business has been in trouble for some time thanks to uninspiring hardware, dated software, and a dismal record on updates. The most recent LG flagships — the G8X ThinQ and V60 ThinQ — launched with dual-screen gimmicks that tried to piggyback on the folding phone fad, but neither have enough going for them to turn the company's fortunes around. Oh, those name surely don't help either. We now know that the G series is to be replaced by something entirely new, and LG hasn't been shy about giving us more details. </p>
<p> Looks like Samsung and Motorola have been hanging out at the local trademark office again, as both companies have registered names of some upcoming devices. </p>
<p> Samsung registered three new names (because we know how much they love to release at least one new Galaxy device every month week): the Galaxy Metrix, Velvet, and Legend (cough HTC cough). Aside from that, we only know that all three names were registered as "goods and services: mobile telephones, smartphones." Surprise, surprise. </p>
<p> Motorola also trademarked the name of an upcoming device: the "Electrify Icon," which can be assumed to be a sequel to last year's Electrify smartphone (aka Photon 4G). </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/18 9:35am PDTon Apr 18, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/29 10:12am PDTon Jul 29, 2020. </p>
<p> Paying and getting paid is easier than ever, but the various apps you can choose to transact with have their upsides and downsides. Picking one can be difficult, and signing up for all of them even more so — especially when it often means convincing friends and family to do so as well. But old school bank ACH transfer tools are for the birds, and cold, hard cash remains a dicey proposition in the current environment. Splitting the bill with cash is also just a pain, and newer peer to peer (P2P) payment apps are so much more convenient that it's truly silly in 2020 not to be using one. </p>
<p> PayPal-owned Venmo is rolling out a new paintjob for its app, cutting down on its signature blue for more white and making it easier to get to paying or requesting money. </p>
<p> Back in July, Uber announced that Venmo, PayPal's strange mobile payment service/social media feed combo, would be added as a payment method "in the coming weeks." It's been about seven weeks since then, and Venmo support has just gone live for both Uber and Uber Eats. </p>
<p> PayPal has revealed today that it will be adding Venmo as an option during checkout. For now, it will be opt-in for users of Venmo and will manifest itself with the same convenience as PayPal. During the checkout process, users will be able to select Venmo with no changes required by sellers. There is no additional cost to the customer or retailer to use Venmo over PayPal. </p>
<p> Mobile payments app Venmo has been around for years now, but without two-factor authentication, security hasn't been as good as it could be. Fortunately the company is now getting around to changing that. Today it announced that it has added two-factor authentication to its mobile apps (Android and iOS) as well as the web. </p>
<p> When you attempt to sign into Venmo from a new phone, the service will send you a 6-digit code that you will need in order to get inside. </p>
<p> Going forward, Venmo will automatically enable this feature for anyone who uses the latest version of the app. </p>
<p> One of PayPal's problems is that it's immensely popular. As the service implements more features and grows to support a larger user base, it inevitably loses some people along the way. If you want an app that makes it easy to send money to friends that isn't PayPal, Venmo is worth a look. It's simple, doesn't charge to send money from most bank accounts or debit cards, and it just received an update that makes the experience look more at home on Android. </p>
<p> In addition to the new look, Venmo now has a home screen widget that enables faster payments. </p>
<p> If there are two words that can quickly get people excited, it's "free money." And we just so happened to have some to give away, thanks to Venmo. Haven't heard of Venmo? Here's the skinny: it's a quick, easy, and efficient way to instantly send money to friends. Kind of like Paypal, but without the Paypal-ness of it all – it's all just very simple and straightforward. </p>
<p> The fees are also extremely reasonable: transferring money from your Venmo balance is free, as are payments funded by U.S. bank accounts and most debit cards. Only credit card transfers are subject to the standard 3% convenience fee. </p>

<p> Venture HR </p>
<p> Fossil is one of the most prominent Wear OS manufacturers around, and, in my opinion, its latest offerings are among the sleekest, most stylish, and feature-packed smartwatches on the market. Whether you're shopping around for your next watch or you're searching for a last-minute Valentine's Day gift for that special someone, now is the perfect time to pick up a Fossil Gen 4 Venture. Several retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, and Fossil, just slashed its price to a new all-time low of $129 — which represents a savings of $146 off the MSRP or roughly $30 off recent pricing. </p>
<p> Fossil is one of the leading Wear OS smartwatch manufacturers, and I personally like the brand's timepieces for their stylish design and overall features. Among the company's top products is the fourth-generation Venture, which came out a year ago but still features decent specs and great looks. Four of the timepiece's variants have just gone one sale for $175, which is $100 off their original retail price. </p>

<p> venue </p>
<p> After being thoroughly unimpressed with the sleek and sexy DROID Charge last week, and knowing that the Venue was next on my device-review checklist, I was prepared for yet more disappointment. Let's face it - Dell has been the butt of quality control, technical support, and advertising (Dude! you're...) jokes for years now. Whether or not it has at all been deserved is another matter entirely - after all, Dell is a hugely successful company (I happen to be writing this review on a Dell netbook, in fact). </p>
<p> Do you have $500 laying around to spend on a smartphone? Well then, have we got a deal for you - Dell's most attractive piece of Android hardware to date, the Venue (formerly know by its code name "Thunder"), is up for grabs on Dell's website right now. At $500, it's not too exorbitant a price for an unlocked handset, and you get your choice of frequency band versions: AT&T or T-Mobile. </p>

<p> Earlier this month, we learned that Verizon was beginning to roll out access to its low-band 5G network. Dubbed "5G Nationwide," the expanded connectivity is now rolling out to a number of 5G-capable Samsung devices, including phones from the S20 and Note20 lines, as well as a few A-series phones, too. </p>
<p> Though these devices support 5G already, software updates are needed to allow access to Verizon's low-band coverage. The updates rolling out add support for this capability, as well as bring improved device performance and the September security patch to most devices. Here's the list of devices that we know are receiving the upgrade, with more likely on the way. </p>
<p> Right now, all of Verizon's monthly plans and prepaid plans include access to the 5G Nationwide network, so if you've got one of the supported devices, you'll probably get your first taste of 5G after downloading the latest update. </p>

<p> verizon carrier billing android </p>
<p> If you're a Verizon Wireless customer, you might be seeing a new payment option in your Play Store billing screen this morning. That option, as you've probably guessed, is carrier billing. We reported on the announcement just a couple of weeks ago. </p>
<p> For a lot of folks, this is easier than adding a credit card to the Play Store, but if you've got kids (or other spendthrift loved ones), this presents a new and exciting danger to your wallet. </p>
<p> Google has just confirmed on the official Play Store Twitter account that carrier billing for Verizon customers will be making its way to handsets in the coming weeks. </p>
<p> Hey @verizon Customers! Pay for Google Play apps, music and more on your phone bill. We're rolling this out over the coming weeks. Enjoy! </p>
<p> Verizon joins Sprint, AT&T (on some devices only), and T-Mobile, all of which have carrier billing, rounding out the US's big four. </p>

<p> verizon galaxy camera </p>
<p> If you happened to be one of the less than 13 people who shelled out $550 to get Verizon's variant of the Galaxy Camera, then a nice update is heading your way. It appears to bring some pretty useful new features, like S Memo, a new Help App, four new Smart Modes, and a nifty remote view finder. </p>
<p> So far as the new Smart Modes are concerned, the update brings scenes for dawn, indoor parties, snow, and food to the device, for a total of 19. </p>
<p> After our review, the Galaxy Camera may not be high on your wishlist this holiday season, but if you're set on Samsung's smartphone-meet-camera mashup, and AT&T's HSPA+ version isn't quick enough for your fast-paced shutterbug lifestyle, you may be in luck: it looks like the Verizon Galaxy Camera is for real. </p>
<p> A Samsung product page appears to have inadvertently gone live for the device (model EK-GC120), boasting Verizon's 4G LTE connectivity, along with everything else the standard Galaxy Camera does. </p>

<p> verizon galaxy tab </p>
<p> This morning, Verizon announced that Samsung's Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 has been infused with LTE, and that the mobile data-fied cheap-slate will be available on August 17th for a rather appealing $350. The Tab 2 may not be our favorite 7" Android tablet anymore (hey, who can blame us?), but when Eric reviewed it back in April, he found it to be a highly capable little device. And that's surprising, because he hates things with stupid names. </p>
<p> Well it isn't exactly unexpected, but the Boy Genius Report claims to have multiple sources inside Verizon Wireless who not only sent them the above image, but also were able to confirm that Samsung will announce more about this particular 7-inch tablet at its September 16 media event. </p>
<p> Additionally, Engadget decided to join the internal screenshot party and provide an image of their own, which is essentially the same, only a lot sharper and inserted below. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Tab is really shaping up to one awesome tablet, and if this latest rumor from the Wall Street Journal turns out to be true, a lot of people will be able to experience it for themselves. </p>
<p> Apparently, "three people familiar with the matter" told WSJ that Samsung already has deals with Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T that involve a certain 7-inch tablet - deals similar to the ones made for the Galaxy S line of phones. </p>

<p> Android N (Nutella? Nougat?) is edging closer and closer to an official stable release, but that doesn't mean 6.0 Marshmallow is anywhere close to saturation point: according to Android's official monthly distribution numbers, only 10.1% of Android users are using that latest stable version of the OS. That should increase a little bit more in the next week or two, with Verizon announcing the Marshmallow update for its Galaxy Note Edge is ready. </p>
<p> The update brings all the things you would expect of a Marshmallow-based upgrade. Now on Tap is here (which is getting better all the time), as are on-demand permissions and Doze, saving you crucial battery life. </p>
<p> According to both Verizon and HTC's Mo Versi, owners of the HTC 10 will receive an OTA update starting on Friday. As seems to be tradition for HTC flagships, the early months are characterized by a flurry of camera refinements and this round seems no different. </p>
<p> Getting a software update from Verizon is usually a real treat, since Big Red isn't normally too fond of pushing them out. Well, Verizon Galaxy S5 owners, this is one of your special days. Before getting too excited, though, there isn't much to this one. </p>
<p> Weren't you dying to get GALAXY Apps on your S5? No? Too bad, here it is. This is the rebranded version of Samsung Apps, so newer is probably better, even if many users would prefer neither. GALAXY Apps should have a far wider selection than its predecessor. </p>
<p> A more meaningful update is that the fingerprint scanner can now be used to unlock your phone when you have a Microsoft Exchange account acting as a device administrator. </p>

<p> verizon z4v </p>
<p> Remember the Verizon Z4v? Me neither [almost]! I even wrote an article about this phone like 2 weeks ago and I still barely remember it. If you want a refresher: the Z4v was basically a Verizon-ified version of the Xperia Z4. Which launched way back in April. There's also that whole "the Z5 now exists" thing, which makes releasing a new Z4 variant kind of pointless and generally a bit silly. </p>
<p> Verizon, in what can only be called a mildly astonishing moment of self-realization and pragmatism, has therefore decided to cancel the phone. Take it away, Albert: </p>
<p> Verizon will no longer be launching Xperia Z4v, however we are committed to supporting Sony Mobile’s product portfolio and will support existing products. </p>
<p> Remember that time Verizon announced it will carry a version of the Xperia Z4 called the Xperia Z4v three months ago? And said it would be out "this summer?" Well, summer ends in exactly... tomorrow, and the phone still isn't out. It was actually allegedly supposed to be released over a month ago, but now any kind of launch before October seems highly unlikely. Some guy got one anyway (somehow) and reviewed it in this video on YouTube. Verizon's site, by the way, says the phone is still "coming soon." </p>
<p> As I hope we can all agree, this is tremendously, mind-bendingly dumb for several reasons. </p>

<p> No product is perfect - especially when it launches. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that software updates are often pushed out shortly after release so as to eliminate bugs, incompatibilities, and increase speed. </p>
<p> It appears that's exactly what Verizon's doing today, for software version.2.2.20.A955.Verizon.en.US/BP: BP_C_01.09.05P for the Droid 2 is now rolling out, OTA style. It isn't a major revision, but it does include a number of enhancements, including: </p>
<p> Streamlined setup of Visual Voice Mail </p>
<p> Improved contact syncing with Corporate Exchange </p>
<p> More accurate contact pictures in the recent call log </p>

<p> version 3.0 </p>
<p> Let's face it: productivity suites like Microsoft Office or the cloud-based Google Docs aren't exactly exciting, but they are among the most vital applications for the businessmen in us. Whether this remains true when 2.8-4.3-inch displays are concerned is debatable, but if you ask DataViz, the company that developed the free Documents To Go app, the answer is a resounding "yes." </p>
<p> The company has just released a brand new version 3.0 of its uber-popular app, which includes numerous improvements, namely: </p>
<p> a "totally redesigned" UI (not so sure that's for the better, though; all I'm seeing right now is a bunch of ugly blue menus) </p>
<p> an enhanced file browser </p>
<p> Google Docs support (the one thing that had always been missing for me) </p>
<p> an improved PDF viewer that now includes various zooming options (pinch-to-zoom and double-tap-to-zoom), keypad shortcuts, hyperlinks, the ability to rotate a page, render multiple pages, and more </p>
<p> an "optimized" version of Slideshow To Go </p>
<p> support for password-protected Office 2003 & 2007 docs as well as support for Microsoft Office 2010 files </p>
<p> The free version of the app doesn't allow you to edit or create files but can be used for reading them. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/vertical-video/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484697" filename="vertical-video">
<p> Most of the professionally produced video you watch is filmed for a TV or movie screen—it's landscape. That makes sense, of course, because most screens don't rotate to portrait mode, that new Samsung spinning TV notwithstanding. However, your phone does rotate, and a new streaming service called Quibi wants to take advantage of that. Quibi will offer premium video content that you can watch in either portrait or landscape, and you can switch back and forth whenever you want. </p>
<p> While you can use smartphones in horizontal orientations, apps like Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and others highly encourage vertical video formats. As such, content creators and regular folks shooting horizontally have to crop their clips to fit these social media platforms — a tedious process. Adobe and other companies have been working on automating this process for years, but now Google is also entering the intelligent auto-cropping game with its open-source AutoFlip framework. </p>
<p> Everyone loves vertical video, right? Well, we've got good news for you; Instagram has unveiled IGTV, a new video app with longer content exclusively in the beloved vertical format. Additionally, the company has just reached one billion users, which is no small feat. </p>
<p> A teardown of Google Maps v.9.58 turned up some signs that video contributions would become a feature in the very near future. If you're registered as a Local Guide, that time has come. Or at least it's coming, this seems to have only just started rolling out to members of the program today. It doesn't seem as though the videos are actually visible from the detail views yet, but that will probably come soon enough. </p>
<p> A post on the Local Guides Connect forum details the basic process as it invites members to begin submitting footage. Videos can be shot from within Google Maps, but they are limited to a length of just 10 seconds. </p>
<p> Vertical videos are terrible for many reasons, but we may have to come to terms with the fact that people just won't stop recording videos vertically. This inescapable foible of humanity is made slightly less galling by a new feature in YouTube 10.28 (which you can grab from APK Mirror). Vertical videos are now displayed properly (i.e. vertically) when made full screen - something we didn't quite notice until today. </p>

<p> ViacomCBS </p>
<p> CBS All Access might have had the most lukewarm reception of a new streaming service to date when it launched in late 2014, though the mountain of new terrible Star Trek shows has given it periodic bumps in subscriber counts. Now that CBS has merged with Viacom (after splitting in 2005), the combined media conglomerate is preparing to re-launch CBS All Access with more content and a new name. </p>
<p> These days, traditional TV is becoming less and less common. With the advent of streaming, people can choose what to watch when they want to watch it. YouTube TV launched back in 2017 with the promise to bring cable into the modern age. Over the years, the service has added a lot of features, but at what cost? Today, Google is announcing that eight new channels from ViacomCBS are live on YouTube TV, along with a price jump from $49.99 up to $64.99. </p>
<p> According to a press release issued earlier today, ViacomCBS will be bringing more of its channel lineup to Google's YouTube TV, with fourteen new channels coming. The new multi-year distribution agreement includes BET, Comedy Central, and Nickelodeon. </p>

<p> The OnePlus 5T is without a doubt an enthusiast phone. And what good would an enthusiast phone be without an available custom recovery? TWRP has just added support for the 5T, as well as the Moto G5 Plus and a few other devices. </p>
<p> Since our last LineageOS post, the project has continued to add new features and support new devices. In addition to new Quick Settings tiles and changes to included apps, the ROM now supports 16 additional devices. </p>
<p> Mobile World Congress has become the premiere stage for new phones and tablet introductions, and since Lenovo saves its Motorola portfolio for the latter half of the year, it's time for the first-party devices to shine. Well, shimmer. Perhaps "gleam" would be a better word. Out of five new phones and tablets introduced on the show floor, none of them are particularly mind-blowing, and the phones are unlikely to make it to stores in the US or Europe. Anyway, let's take it from the top: </p>

<p> Viber has been releasing a bunch of new features and upgrades lately, from increasing its group call limits to letting users save notes and to-dos. Now the messaging service has launched a GIF creation tool on iOS... with Android to follow in the coming weeks 😒. </p>
<p> In many countries around the world right now, social distancing or even stricter quarantine measures have been put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus — this means we're all far more dependent on technology if we want to hang out with our friends. Zoom and Houseparty get-togethers might be all the rage right now, but other communication apps are also doing their bit in this time of need. Viber has increased the maximum number of participants in group calls to 20 so you can chat with more of your friends at once. </p>
<p> Viber announced today a new note-taking feature appropriately dubbed "My Notes." Notes are accessible from your Chats list; adding a new note is the same experience as sending a message, and your list of notes looks an awful lot like a normal Viber conversation, but with additional features to help with organization. </p>
<p> Things were simpler back in the days of SMS, but now you have to choose which silo you're going to lock yourself inside. The messaging world has been consumed by the likes of Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, but there are also smaller players like Viber. Fans of that app will be happy to hear there's a dark mode in the latest update, and you don't even have to send a moon emoji to anyone. </p>
<p> Books, movies, and series are common ways to widely share a story, but it's far more common to tell personal adventures orally or over text messages. However, Viber came up with a new feature that mixes things up, letting you read short stories on your phone, which take the shape of fictitious text messages. </p>
<p> Messaging apps are only good when many people use them. That's why the market is dominated by a few big players like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and good ol' text messages. Other platforms have to find ways to incentivize people to switch to them, and one way to do that is by offering features the leaders don't yet have. That's why Viber is introducing Create a Sticker, allowing you to make and share your own sticker sets without leaving the app. </p>
<p> When it comes to messaging apps, companies are fighting to increase their market shares with features such as screen sharing, context-aware recommendations, and even fact-checking services. Viber has been busy improving its offering with the recent addition of a dark mode and the ability to edit sent messages. However, some elementary features were missing compared to its most famous rival, like quick replies and clearer conversation status visibility. These are finally making their way to the app with the rollout of minor improvements that make the software just a little more convenient to use. </p>
<p> Thanks to messaging platforms like Viber, calling and texting across the world is a breeze and doesn't cost a dime. However, there are circumstances when people need to call or text you with an actual phone without relying on an Internet connection. For instance, if you live abroad, it would be easier for your grandma to give you a ring with her old-fashioned landline. A local number can also be handy to confirm a booking, or even let your foreign clients dial you in more easily. For all these occasions, you previously had to go through the hassle of using an app to get a virtual line or buy a local number. </p>
<p> Viber just announced the launch of the latest revision to its mobile messaging app, bringing a new UI and some new group features. The company also claims that the redesign offers users double the performance when sending messages. </p>
<p> Making a typo you can't correct is one of the more frustrating parts of text communication. Viber seems to agree, because now you're able to edit messages you've sent through the service. Like in other apps that offer similar functions, edited messages will be marked as such to limit any possible confusion. </p>

<p> Lenovo is an up-and-coming player in the Android world, having taken the Chinese smartphone market by storm in the last couple of years. Now that it owns Motorola, we'll likely be hearing the Lenovo name even more often over here in the US as the company seeks to expand the presence of its Android portfolio across the world. </p>
<p> This is probably especially true of tablets, which Lenovo has consistently been creating for a number of years now, and an area where Motorola has generally fallen flat. </p>
<p> Lenovo, despite being the relatively new owners of Motorola Mobility, didn't need this acquisition to produce attractive new hardware - at least for markets other than the US. The Vibe Z, which never made it to our corner of the world, looks poised to get a sequel that ups its game in every area that matters. Shots of a phone dubbed the Lenovo Vibe Z2 Pro have surfaced, showing a 6-inch phone with a quad HD display, a 4000mAh battery, a 16MP OIS camera with dual LED flash, and a Snapdragon 801 processor.

<p> LineageOS 17.1 is the latest release of the popular custom ROM, based on Android 10. The LineageOS project was already providing daily builds for over 60 phones and tablets, but in the time since we last covered the ROM, a handful of additional phones have been granted official support. </p>
<p> The LineageOS project is busy as always, adding support for more devices and implementing new features. The last time we covered the popular custom ROM, official builds for the OnePlus 6T and 7 Pro arrived, and there have been plenty of additions (or re-additions, in some cases) since then. </p>
<p> LineageOS is one of the most popular custom ROMs available, with somewhere around two million active installations. It typically takes a while for the project to update to newer versions of Android, since development is largely done by maintainers in their spare time. Six months after the public release of Android 9 Pie, it looks like LineageOS is about ready to make the jump — but not before dropping older devices. </p>

<p> Disney's Movies Anywhere has just launched a new service that allows you to store and access all your movies in one place. It has support from 5 major Hollywood studios, but more importantly also from 4 digital retailers where users already have movie libraries. Content from Amazon Video, Google Play, iTunes, and Vudu can be brought into the Movies Anywhere app, which is great for anyone with a fragmented collection spanning more than one of those services. Now, you'll only ever need to use one app again. </p>
<p> Comcast is doing what Comcast does best: making its monopolized customers really, really hate the company. That's just Comcast's general state of being, but in this specific sense, it's all about the streaming cable TV app for Android. As promised, the former XFINITY TV app has been replaced with the all-new, all-different XFINITY Stream. </p>
<p> These days, GoPro is the king of the hill for action and aerial photography. Sure, you could wrap some tape around your phone and send it up on a quadcopter or toss it into a sandwich bag and hope it doesn't spring a leak at the bottom of the pool, but those are terrible ideas—seriously, don't try them. Since you won't be putting your phone (or tablet) through near certain destruction, why not use it instead to edit those great videos? GoPro announced that it has acquired popular mobile video editing apps Replay and Splice. Both apps are currently iOS exclusives, but the company has plans to bring them to Android later this year. </p>
<p> Vine isn't a platform known for outstanding videography, on account of being limited to mobile cameras (not to mention the time limit). But starting today, users on Android should notice a definite improvement in the quality of uploaded videos, at least according to the latest app update. Of course, the quality will still be limited by your phone or tablet's camera and the shooting conditions in any particular location. Exactly how video quality is being improved (bitrate bump? Resolution? Post-processing?) hasn't been addressed. </p>
<p> The only other notable update is to the notification options. I'm not a regular Vine user myself, but the Settings menu now includes options to display Likes, Comments, Re-vines, Mentions, and Follows in either a semi-curated "tailored to you" fashion or from anyone. </p>

If you own a Google Assistant Smart Display — be it a Nest Hub, a Lenovo Smart Display, JBL Link View, or LG ThinQ View — you get one more possibility: You can video call your display to have a face-to-face chat. Although that feature has been available for a year, it wasn't well known, so Google has been trying to better surface it to users. </p>

<p> Google's Pixel phones may offer stellar still photography, but they've never been known to focus much effort on video. That seems to be changing with the release of the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G. Google is bringing a handful of new "Hollywood-inspired" stabilization effects that should make videos a lot more fun to capture: Locked, Active, and Cinematic Pan. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/07/06 6:30pm PDTon Jul 6, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/16 3:06am PDTon Jul 16, 2020. </p>
<p> The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has fundamentally changed how we all do business, take classes, and meet our family members. Many of our streaming apps have had to lower the video quality to spare some bandwidth for the more important stuff. Following Netflix’s lead, YouTube also began capping the video resolution to standard definition on mobile phones. What was supposed to be a temporary restriction for Indian users has now been in place for three months, affecting hundreds of millions, and there's no sign that Google will ease it anytime soon. </p>
<p> There's nothing worse than watching your favorite show and having it pause to buffer at the most intriguing moment. Unfortunately, commuters can experience this quite often, but Netflix is trying an unusual way to solve this issue. Indeed, the company is testing how it can improve video quality while a viewer is on the go by tracking their "physical activity." </p>
<p> YouTube for Android has had a few ups and downs in the last months as the native app was replaced by what is essentially a web wrapper (you can test it by going to youtube.com/tv) and dumped many features that were later slowly added back. The latest of the features to make it back onto the interface is the resolution adjustment selector that you can see in the screenshot above. Also rolling out is a new interface, but it doesn't appear to be live for everyone just yet. </p>
<p> YouTube usually updates your video's resolution on the fly depending on your connection speed, but if you want to manually choose a specific quality setting, you can do so now. </p>
<p> There's a reason we here at AP have a dedicated Verizon hero with devilish features grafted on: the company consistently makes changes that are unfair to its customers. After limiting video quality to 480p and 720p depending on the tier of unlimited plan back in August, Verizon has now brought full-quality streams back - for an extra $10 per month. </p>
<p> With so many things happening this week surrounding Google's new hardware, it's easy to overlook some of the software updates rolling out. The latest version bump to YouTube Music doesn't include much in the way of visible changes, but a teardown of the apk also reveals some worthwhile additions in the works for the future. As always, the apk is ready and waiting at the APK Mirror link below if the Play Store isn't already serving the latest version to you. </p>
<p> Many of Google's most recent updates have been relatively light on features, turning instead towards cleaning up bugs. However, that doesn't mean there aren't still new things in the works. A couple of recent YouTube updates have been preparing some new features and we've got a teardown to reveal what users can probably look forward to in the future. </p>
<p> Vine isn't a platform known for outstanding videography, on account of being limited to mobile cameras (not to mention the time limit). But starting today, users on Android should notice a definite improvement in the quality of uploaded videos, at least according to the latest app update. Of course, the quality will still be limited by your phone or tablet's camera and the shooting conditions in any particular location. Exactly how video quality is being improved (bitrate bump?

<p> For people who have a Comcast cable subscription, the Xfinity TV Go app is quite the nice piece of software. Rather than just providing shows for immediate streaming, which is less groundbreaking these days than it used to be, Comcast provides quite a few channels for live streaming. Now many more networks are available, including A&E, Cooking Channel, DIY, Food Network, HGTV, History Channel, MUN2 (companion to Telemundo), Sprout, Starz, TBS, TRUtv, TNT, and the Travel Channel. Aside from missing CBS, March Madness is pretty much covered. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, the experience could still be much better. There's no channel line-up, and the name of the currently playing network is about as much information as you're going to get. </p>

<p> video recording </p>
<p> Android 11 may not have had a lot of flashy new features, but at least we should credit it for fixing or improving some of the outstanding issues. Back in June, we examined a fix that had just rolled out in the first Android 11 beta that would lift the 4GB cap on videos captured by the camera. While the API that had previously been responsible for setting the 4GB limit was no longer a constraint, it didn't actually make a difference with the Google Camera app or most of the other popular video recorders tested. Now that Android 11 has rolled out and many of us with Pixel phones are running it, here's what has changed and how it works today. </p>
<p> Before phones started recording 4K footage, most people balked at the idea their videos could grow to 4GB and larger. Things have changed, of course, and it takes less than 15 minutes at 4K30p to hit that mark. You might be thinking this shouldn't matter thanks to 64-bit filesystems that can handle file sizes up to 16TB. However, an old API from the days of 32-bit Android still capped sizes at 4GB, which forced video recordings to be split into separate files at regular intervals. A fix for this was promised a while back and Android 11 Beta 1 finally delivers on this, but it's not going to matter if you're not using the right camera apps — and the Google Camera isn't one of them (yet). </p>
<p> Thanks to Google's pioneering role in image processing, Pixel phones are among the best when it comes to photography. That doesn't translate to video recordings, though, which are noticeably worse than the ones you can create with, say, an iPhone. Google has also chosen to limit 4K recording to 30 fps on the Pixel 4, citing a lack of interest from users, despite other manufacturers providing 4K 60fps without problems. It looks like the company might reconsider this decision, as evidence in a leaked Google Camera APK has surfaced that it might be working on a 4K 60fps mode. </p>
<p> Phone cameras have changed a lot in just a few years. Not too long ago, we were all recording VGA-resolution movies to send to friends and family, and now many flagship phones are capable of recording at 4K resolution and at higher frame rates. Android's camera application still won't save videos larger than 4GB, splitting long recordings into multiple files in the process, but that might finally be fixed. </p>
<p> A month ago, Google explained why it doesn't support 4K video recording at 60fps on its latest flagships (or any of its phones, for that matter): It said the majority of users stick with 1080p, so it'd rather focus on improving that mode and avoid large storage consumption by 4K 60fps videos. As it turns out now, there might be another reason related to the Pixel 4's Snapdragon 855 processor, which always pulls images from the two rear cameras at once. </p>
<p> Pixel 4 users had a moment of respite when a Reddit user claimed that his Pixel 4 gained the ability to record 4K 60fps video using an updated version of the Open Camera app — a recognized third-party camera app for Android. It turns out, the claim was nothing but bogus, and the app in question doesn’t go over 30fps no matter what frame rate you pick. </p>
<p> Despite the Pixel 4's multitude of new camera chops, you can still reproach it for a few missing features. It lacks a wide-angle camera, it doesn't have autofocus on the front cam, and Google still limits 4K video capture to 30fps. The company has clarified the reasoning behind the latter. </p>
<p> Pixel 3 bugs have been taking up far too much of our time recently, but thankfully this is one that is very easy to fix. Some users have been noticing that while recording video, their Pixel 3 will still vibrate for incoming notifications, causing the video to distort along with the buzz. This is something that should be prevented by default, and the solution is simple. </p>
<p> HTC isn't doing particularly well these days, and the few people out there who purchased a U12+ likely weren't too pleased with the last bit of news about their devices announced: 'CryptoKitties.' Luckily, HTC is releasing an update for the U12+, starting with the Taiwanese dual-SIM model and coming soon to US and European versions. </p>

<p> Regular followers of HTC's customer relations will recognize Mo Versi, the company's vice president of product management. He often gives out helpful information on his personal Twitter account, explaining when notable updates are coming for HTC phones and even giving support answers one at a time to his followers. He's considered, in the somewhat insular circles of Android-focused tech blogging, a good dude. And yesterday he gave out some good news: the HTC One M9 Marshmallow update is scheduled to hit a handful of Canadian carriers on Monday. </p>
<p> Great news for our Sasktel, Rogers, Wind and Videotron HTC One M9 owners! </p>
<p> Looks like every carrier in Canada (give or take a couple) decided to announce GS4 pre-orders at the same time. The good news, though, is that if you're on Telus, Bell, Virgin, or Videotron, you're one step closer to landing yourself a shiny new phone. The device is available for pre-order on all four of the aforementioned carriers, with a shipping date of April 27th for the former three. </p>
<p> Customers on Telus and Bell will be able to grab this handset for $200 with a three-year agreement (yikes!); Videotron customers will see the same price, though there's no word on agreement terms in the PR. </p>
<p> If you travelled back in time to the middle of 2010 and asked your average Canadian about the selection of Android devices available to them, you would not be impressed with their answer - it seems that up until this year, the Android selection in Canada was about 6 months behind the curve. </p>
<p> Canadians, myself included, can now stop bemoaning their second rate options. As of today, two major new devices, the Nexus S and the Motorola Xoom, have been made available to those in the Great White North. </p>

<p> We've gotten a few sneak peeks over the past couple of weeks of what the Pixel 5 might look like in full. The indications are there to say that Google is completely done with the dual-tone back design. But one should never turn down a venture into an alternative timeline — so it doe looks like with this one picture of what appears to be a Pixel 4a 5G prototype from Vietnam. </p>
<p> Spotify has been working on proper lyrics support for ages. It likely takes this long to implement the seemingly simple feature in part due to licensing issues surrounding songtexts, which already led to a lawsuit against Google. Spotify seems to have finally found a suitable solution, as TechCrunch reports that the company is planning to roll out lyrics synced with music to 26 markets today. The US, Canada, and the UK aren't among these, though. </p>
<p> Google took the unusual step of confirming the existence of its upcoming Pixel phone this year, but we don't expect the full Pixel 4 unveiling for another month. That hasn't stopped some people in Southeast Asia from getting their hands on the phone. We have no idea what they're saying, but you get a good look at the phone in these videos. </p>
<p> According to a report earlier today published by Nikkei Asian Review, Google is planning to move some of its Pixel production to Vietnam, escaping both rising Chinese production costs and US government's escalating trade war with the country. Google has already started renovating a former Nokia factory for the purpose, and currently plans to shift some Pixel 3a production there by the end of the year. </p>
<p> We love news of Google Assistant adding more language support. This means more people can talk to this digital helper in their native tongue, extending its reach and usefulness. Today sees one more language being supported: Vietnamese. </p>
<p> Developers with apps on the Play Store can set up promo codes to give users a paid app or an in-app product for free — if they live in an eligible country. But the list of countries where developers can issue Play Store promo codes is expanding at a quick pace. Seven countries (Argentina, Chile, Peru, Czech Republic, Hungary, Israel, and Romania) were added to the fold in the past few weeks alone, and now four more countries are part of the list: Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam. </p>
<p> Spotify has just launched in Israel, Romania, South Africa, and Vietnam, bringing the total amount of worldwide markets to 65. So if you live in one of those four countries and you've been patiently waiting to become one of 159 million users worldwide (or you're lamenting the loss of Spotify Dogfood), it's your lucky day. </p>
<p> Google Play carrier billing is expanding to more carriers around the world, as per an update to the support page. Some of the newly listed carriers may have been offering the option for a while (but weren't mentioned in the page), others may be about to add it soon, but the official word is out now. </p>
<p> For those of you in the US, the one added operator is Boost Mobile. But there's great news for a few more countries as well. Here are the newcomers: </p>
<p> Luxembourg: Orange </p>
<p> Beside Indonesia, which adds support for Vodafone on top of Indosat, Telekomsel, and XL/AXIS, the 5 other countries are seeing direct carrier billing available for the first time through these new operators. </p>
<p> It's always a happy day when one of Google Play's entities rolls out to new countries because it means more users will be able to benefit from the entertainment options that were available to others before them. But it's especially a happier day when one of said countries is Lebanon, because I live there and because we're usually one of the last countries to get anything from Google. </p>
<p> But today we're celebrating because Google Play Movies has officially landed in Lebanon and 10 other countries. All of them are Middle Eastern, except for Vietnam — Chào! Here is the full list: </p>
<p> Slowly but surely, the creatures are coming. They advance, nation by nation, relentless, refusing to stop until the entire planet is their domain. Hundreds of millions have felt their impact. Politicians and titans of industry are not immune. And even mainstream news outlets are scrambling to find "22 Tips For Catching Pokémon - #12 Will Make You Scream!" Today developer Niantic continues its bid for global mobile gaming domination by expanding Pokémon GO to 15 new markets in Asia, including hundreds of millions of new potential players on iOS and Android. </p>

<p> The Google Assistant may be a polyglot among its AI-powered virtual brethren, but what mars the experience is its lingual inconsistency across supported platforms. Even though it’s been conversing in Hindi and Vietnamese on phones for long, the support for Android TV was just added. The two Asian languages join a small list of languages that the Assistant can understand and speak on your big screen. </p>
<p> We love news of Google Assistant adding more language support. This means more people can talk to this digital helper in their native tongue, extending its reach and usefulness. Today sees one more language being supported: Vietnamese. </p>
<p> Google Translate's camera mode, which allows you to highlight text from pictures to read them in your native language, is still one of the best real-world implementations of machine learning. Earlier this year, a handful of new Indian languages were added to the camera mode, and now 13 more are supported. </p>
<p> "Hebrew, Hungarian, and Vietnamese" sounds like the setup for a rather tasteless "guys walk into a bar" joke. But don't worry, readers of delicate disposition: it's just the latest update to DuoLingo, the much-loved language learning app. The August 1st update posted to the Play Store lists all three languages as additions to its growing list, so feel free to bone up on them if you're planning an oddly specific bit of international travel. </p>

<p> Sometimes it seems like YouTube is perpetually testing different interfaces for its Android app. Based on reports we've received recently, yet another set of modifications is being tested. The latest round of tweaks is on the subtle side: some are seeing the thumbnails for individual videos in the Home tab show view counts, with more space for video titles and the channel logo repositioned below. </p>
<p> Google is imbuing the Street View app with some clever new features in its latest update. This version adds automatic face detection for 360 photos for quick blurring, groups together unpublished 360 photos by place or time, and adds a share link to user profiles. Additionally, a teardown shows that there's a new feature on the way that will clue in ambitious users about nearby places that should be photographed. </p>
<p> What's New </p>
<p> Official Changelog: </p>
<p> Unpublished 360 photos will now group together based on place or time. </p>
<p> Automatically detect faces for blurs in 360 photos. </p>
<p> Almost anyone who uses YouTube regularly has seen a video with either 301 or 301+ views, according to the player. Why is this? Well, Google automatically checks videos crossing this threshold of views to see if the visitors are legitimate or just bots designed to pump up the number. From now on, they are tweaking the method to count "real" views in real time and only holding off on adding those that YouTube is unsure about. </p>
<p> Stopping at a low-ish number like 301 kept a video with fake views from looking too popular. </p>

<p> Last week, we found out that Viewsonic would be rebranding and selling a 7" and 10" tablet; the 7" tablet would be Android while the 10" would dual-boot Android and Win7. Now Engadget has a hands-on preview of the 10" with additional details, and suffice it to say there are some ups and downs. </p>
<p> Bad news first, though: the tablet runs Android 1.6. The reason for this lies in the CPU used, but that doesn't make shipping a tablet with an OS that's over a year old suck any less. </p>
<p> With the possible exception of Archos, there are no big names in the Android tablet field right now. If you have a tablet running a Google-flavoured OS, chances are it’s from Shenzen, has a resistive touchscreen, and will have been superseded by a newer model by the end of this paragraph. Enter ViewSonic. They’re a display company with some fairly well-regarded LCD monitors, which should bode well for the display of their newly announced, previously-rumored tablet. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/vine/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17483975" filename="vine">
<p> vine </p>
<p> Vine was the internet phenomenon that proved that short, easily digestible video clips could be tremendously popular and spark creativity. However, the rigid six-second format had soon been adopted and loosened up by Instagram and later TikTok, and after Twitter purchased Vine, it vanished into obscurity. An unceremonious death followed in 2016. But Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann still believes in the format and has been working on a successor for a long time. After an extensive beta phase, this new product, Byte, is now official and stable on the Play Store. </p>
<p> As you may remember, Vine was a simple app with short looping videos. It gained immense popularity and was acquired by Twitter in 2013 but was unceremoniously discontinued late in 2016 amid strong competition from Snapchat and Instagram. If you're still mourning its loss, you'll be pleased to hear that the Vine founder is making another app. </p>
<p> Twitter ruffled some feathers when they announced that Vine would be discontinued, likely due to Twitter's native support for video and the lack of a revenue stream from Vine. At the same time, they announced that the Vine mobile app would be re-branded into 'Vine Camera,' which went live today. </p>
<p> Twitter launched the Vine video sharing app in 2013, and it was a moderate success. Other apps added similar quick video features, but Vine never seemed like a high priority for Twitter. The company announced today that it's discontinuing the Vine app in the coming months, but it's not deleting your Vines... at least not yet. </p>
<p> Twitter isn't just a place for spitting out sharp criticism and inane musings. Okay it is, but those expressions aren't limited to text. The social network allows for up to 30 seconds of video. </p>
<p> That limit is changing. Twitter is bumping up the max length of a video up from half a minute to 140 seconds. </p>
<p> I am no Vine watcher, but I've heard that there's a lot of cool content on the social network especially if you figure out which users are the most interesting to follow. Lots of creative people have found their niche within the constraints of its short video format and that's what everyone who's sticking around likes about it. </p>
<p> Now Vine is getting updated on Android to allow you, the spectator, to watch an entire channel from start to finish with a single button instead of manually moving from one video to the next. The option is visible in the latest version of the app when you open a channel: there's a new Watch button next to the Follow one. </p>
<p> Music and social media go together like teenagers and places their parents don't know about. Music became such a big part of MySpace, it inspired the likes of SoundCloud. Music videos regularly rack up the most views on YouTube. Chances are, your favorite artists have a Twitter account. </p>
<p> Musicians have used Vine as another way to get themselves noticed and share their music with a new generation. Now Vine intends to help them out. Today it's launching Snap to Beat, an easier way to toss together seamless perfect loops. </p>
<p> Video editing on mobile is still far from perfect - the complexity of the task and the limitations of a small touchscreen mean that getting anything done with precision is tricky. Apps with bite-sized editing like Vine are a good starting point, but we could use something to occupy the middle ground. Enter Redub, a video editing tool from developer Sumoing. It aims to bring a few much-needed tools (and an easy interface) to mobile video editing. </p>
<p> Sumoing first caught our attention with Repix, a better and more effective take on the Instagram formula. Redub takes the same approach to video: keep the simplicity of more limited apps... </p>
<p> Vine is... OK, let's be clear here: Vine is kind of useless. There's literally nothing you can do with Vine that you can't already do with YouTube, unless you count an arbitrary 6.5-second time limit. That being said, there's no reason that Twitter can't improve its property, and it has done just that by boosting the video quality. Newly-created Vines from iOS are now defaulting to 720x720 pixels. Look down there: you can see all the retriever's little golden hairs. </p>
<p> While you can check out the fancy new high-quality Vines on the announcement post, for some reason the developers decided that Android users didn't need the update quite as much as iPhone users did. </p>
<p> Vine, the video equivalent of Twitter, has received an app update that brings in a number of tools that should make getting content onto the site a better experience. The update drops a new icon at the bottom left that lets users pull up videos from their gallery (referred to annoyingly in the app as a camera roll), preview videos of any length, and trim footage down into a 6-second version that probably doesn't do the original any justice (ahem, I mean, make them Vine-ready). </p>
<p> In addition to the aforementioned features, users can mix videos together and perform more actions on their clips. </p>

<p> Video games can often be a source of escapist fantasy... and not always fantasy of the "save the princess" variety. Party Hard, released last year on SHIELD and on SHIELD this summer, falls squarely into the second category. This visceral stealth game is about a Jason Voorhees-style serial killer methodically murdering his partying neighbors. Now there's a mobile version for phones and tablets too, going for $7 with no in-app purchases. Needless to say, it's not for kids. </p>
<p> The original Hotline Miami is a love letter to top-down action game excess, marrying tight and lightning-fast controls to neon-soaked, pixelated 80s aesthetics. (Oh, and that movie Drive.) It's a game that everyone should try at least once, if only to prove that you can make a modern game with old-school aesthetics, but keep enough innovation to make the whole experience seem fresh. On Android Hotline Miami is exclusive to the SHIELD, SHIELD Tablet, and SHIELD TV, and so it is with the sequel, Wrong Number. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got several PC and console pilgrims including Hotline Miami, War Thunder, and Always Sometimes Monsters, a new Portal-inspired Zen Pinball table, a mashup of tactic, RPG, and city-building, and standard platformers and puzzlers. </p>
<p> Earlier this week we reported on Google's decision to refuse an Android port of the PC shooter Postal in the Google Play Store. Two days later, a representative of developer Running With Scissors told us that Amazon had done the same for the Amazon Appstore, and provided us with the rejection letters from both companies. Google refusing to allow the controversial shooter onto the Play Store is merely inconsistent; as we noted at the time, games with similar levels of violence like Grand Theft Auto III are easily available. But Amazon blocking the sale of the Android app, when the company sells the same game as a PC download, was just downright hypocritical. </p>
<p> If you're below a certain age or simply not all that familiar with the history of video games, perhaps you haven't heard about Postal. Originally released for the PC in 1997, Postal was an isometric top-down shooter - think Contra with some better graphics. Postal was, by all accounts, a fairly unremarkable game; its mechanics were simple and its story was rudimentary. What made it notable was its intense violence and the depiction of the "gone postal" protagonist shooting defenseless civilians. </p>
<p> I was seven years old when Carmageddon first hit store shelves in 1997. Even if the game hadn't been widely banned and censored around the world, I still wouldn't have gotten my hands on it. The off-the-wall violence and bloodshed would have been a bit too much for my parents to permit me to play with good conscience. While leagues of long-time fans poured money into the Kickstarter campaign that allowed Stainless Games to port the game to Android in the first place, I am visiting the game for the first time. Thank you, Kickstarters, for giving me the chance. To anyone considering giving Carmageddon a try - don't think, just buy. </p>
<p> Wonderful news for the roughly everyone on the planet who plays Shadowgun: Deadzone: a whole bunch of new stuff is rolling out today! Notably, there's the Gangs feature which allows you to create groups of friends to play with. There are also a couple new maps that you can explore. And by "explore" I mean "kill things in." </p>
<p> There are also new weapon upgrades, some additional hats (because every game has to have hats now, right TF2?) and bug fixes and tweaks all over the place. Here's the full changelog: </p>
<p> What's in this version: </p>
<p> ☣New Features: * Two New Maps * New Weapons Upgrades * Chat in Main Menu * Gangs (Play with Friends) * New Hats * Rewards for finishing Zone Control or DeathMatch * Player Rank increased up to 50 now ☣ GamePlay Tweaks: * Redesigned Weapons Stats * Weapons&Gadgets Are Limited by Ranks ☣ Bug Fixing: * Improved Hit Detection * Fixed VoiceChat * Fixed Network Code * Renderer Optimization * Fixed Wall Exploits in Several Levels </p>
<p> As a side note: I love the radioactivity symbol for bullet points, Shadowgun developers. </p>
<p> I don't know about you, but when I think of the holidays, my mind immediately jumps to gang violence, prostitutes and M ratings. Which is great for me, because Grand Theft Auto III (normally $4.99) and Max Payne Mobile (normally $2.99) are both on sale for just a dollar each on the Play Store right now. God bless us, everyone indeed! </p>
<p> If you decide to buy these games, be sure to clear out plenty of space on your device. Grand Theft Auto III is a 1GB download, and Max Payne Mobile clocks in at 1.33GB. So, grab a glass of egg nog, hop on WiFi, put on Die Hard and have yourself a merry little Christmas. </p>
<p> When you're creating a game, there are a few key things you need to include: a good atmosphere (be it an intriguing story or just some wildly immersive effects), good gameplay mechanics, and a good hook. What's going to grab the users' attention? Well, for Gears and Guts, all three of those requirements can be summed up with "driving cars into zombies." Oh, and did I mention there's a sweet soundtrack to go along with it? </p>
<p> This game ditches any attempts at a story and simply plops you down in a nice little town that's being overrun by the undead, hands you the keys to a muscle car and says "Now have fun." </p>
<p> Here at Android Police, we trade in awesome games. Gingers getting chased by the grim reaper? Check. Apes summoning lightning from the sky? Check. Zombies taking shotgun blasts to the face? Check. A kid playing around in his room when he should be doing his homework? Okay, they can't all be winners. But here's one that is sure to melt your face off: an adorable kitten fighting fields of bunnies. What's that? You don't see what's so awesome about that? Here. Let me show you: </p>
<p> Yes, that's right. These bunnies are terrorists (seriously, some even have bombs strapped to their chests), and our hero, Marbles, has an arsenal of weaponry with which to obliterate the little bunnies. </p>

<p> Newegg is one of the best places to buy electronics online, and we've posted countless deals from the store over the past few years. Internet-based stores have largely been exempt in the past from paying U.S. state taxes, but those legal loopholes are slowly being closed. B&H Photo recently started charging sales tax in almost all states, and now Newegg is following suit. </p>
<p> Writing for Android Police from my home office in Virginia, it's not every day that I get to report on something somewhat close to home. But here it is. A Virginia Circuit Court judge has ruled that while police officers cannot compel a person to give up their passcode, they can demand someone use their fingerprint to unlock their phone. </p>
<p> Judge Steven C. Frucci made the ruling this week, saying that giving a police officer your fingerprint is similar to providing a DNA or handwriting sample, something the law permits. Divulging a password or PIN, however, requires admitting or handing over knowledge, something that's protected by the Fifth Amendment (you have the right to remain silent). </p>
<p> You know the drill by now. It's time for some new LTE market announcements! Woo! Party hard. The network rollouts today are coming to Pennsylvania, California, Indiana, Virginia and Puerto Rico. This comes on the heels of Sprint announcing its intention to purchase the remaining shares of Clearwire that it didn't already own. </p>
<p> Here's the list of new cities: </p>
<p> Indianapolis/Carmel, Ind. </p>
<p> Santa Rosa/Petaluma, Calif. </p>
<p> Vallejo/Fairfield, Calif. </p>
<p> Southern Puerto Rico (including Ponce, Coamo and Guayama) </p>
<p> York/Hanover, Pa. </p>
<p> Franklin County, Pa. </p>
<p> Page County, Va. </p>
<p> Enhanced 4G LTE coverage around Shenandoah County, Va. </p>
<p> Not a bad set of additions. There is still much to be seen in regards to Sprint's LTE network rollout, particularly over the next year. </p>

<p> Virgin Media TV customers in the UK, you can now watch your TiVo live television service or recorded programs on your Android device, anywhere! Anywhere with a WiFi connection, that is. Assuming that you've got a phone or tablet running Android 2.3 through 4.3, but not KitKat 4.4. Oh, and you can't be rooted. Have fun! </p>
<p> All kidding aside, there seem to be some serious issues with Virgin's new TV Anywhere app for Android, starting with the aforesaid KitKat support. </p>
<p> You may recognize this little guy from previous leaks of the so-called HTC Proto. The device looked very similar to the Desire V and, indeed, HTC's latest announcement is dubbed the Desire X. While it's no One X, the device does pack a dual-core Snapdragon S4. Unfortunately, it's not that one. This is the MSM8225 which still uses a 45nm architecture so it's not nearly as zippy as the S4 we all know and love from other, more high-end phones. </p>

<p> Despite Google Assistant now being available on most Android devices, many OEMs have been looking to build their own virtual helpers. Samsung has Bixby, LG has ThinQ, and now Huawei has... something. The company already has an assistant on its Chinese devices, but now it's working on a new one that will 'provide emotional interactions.' </p>
<p> You can already get Alexa in phones, speakers, and a few accessories. Amazon wants more, though. The handful of Alexa-powered accessories on the market were developed with standalone smart features, but that's tough to do. Now, Amazon is looking to strengthen Alexa's position by making it easier to get the virtual assistant integrated with accessories like headphones, smartwatches, and more. These devices will, however, require a phone connection. </p>
<p> Facebook is getting in on the digital assistant game currently occupied by the likes of Google Now, Apple's Siri, and Microsoft's Cortana. But the social network is taking a different approach with M, the name of its virtual pal. This little helper waits around inside Messenger to answer your questions, and in those instances when its algorithms can't come up with a solution, there are real people working behind the scenes who can. </p>
<p> That's right, Facebook says that M's artificial intelligence is trained and supervised by real people. This partially confirms the Moneypenny rumor circulating last month that the company was developing a digital assistant of its own. </p>

<p> Chromebooks were initially designed to be lightweight web-browsing laptops but gradually started gaining more features, especially when it came to offline computing. However, unlike macOS or Linux, Chrome OS doesn't have the ability to locally run Windows apps, which can sometimes be essential, especially when it comes to corporate apps. Back in June, Parallels and Google announced a partnership stating Chromebooks would soon be able to run Windows apps "seamlessly." The promise is now closer to reality, with the Parallels Desktop for Chromebook Enterprise set to be released this fall. </p>
<p> Chromebooks weren't originally designed to run traditional PC software, but Google is slowly attempting to fill that gap. Chrome OS already has an optional Linux container for running some desktop software (albeit with poor graphical performance), but now Windows applications will soon appear on the platform in some capacity </p>
<p> Intel's progress into the Android ecosystem hasn't exactly been earth-shattering. The number of high-end and mid-range smartphones equipped with an ATOM CPU still number in the single digits, making the x86 architecture a fairly low priority for app developers. In addition, Intel's emulator images have always lacked support for the Google APIs, leaving developers without the ability to test common staples like Google Maps or push messaging. Fortunately, that issue was recently rectified with KitKat as Google and Intel have finally shipped an x86 system image with Google API support. </p>
<p> Ok, so testing Android apps with Google-specific features on an ATOM emulator probably doesn't sound terribly exciting, but there's a major upshot: developers can finally use HAXM without making sacrifices! </p>
<p> Using a work phone and a personal phone at the same time sucks. That's the motivator behind the Bring Your Own Device ("BYOD") trend, wherein employees use their own smartphones for work-related tasks. Most people do this anyway, but it can become a real problem if you're working with sensitive data. That's where VMware comes in. This company specializes in virtualized PCs for remote access and security, and after years of development, it's expanding into mobile with Android. Too bad it's only available on Verizon at the moment - and only on two mid-range phones at that. </p>
<p> VMware's Horizon Mobile solution works like this: your company sets up a default mobile workspace, complete with apps, security measures, and even a wallpaper if they want. </p>
<p> A few days ago, I posted about a student project at a Russian University that aims to run two or more instances of Android at the same time on a single device. It's a technology called virtualization, and we already use it on web servers and developer machines everywhere. </p>
<p> At first glance, the idea sounds interesting, but seems to lack practical uses for the majority of people. Sure, some developers will save a few hours on testing, and industrious users might want to run the latest CyanogenMod nightly ROM alongside their daily driver, but this kind of stuff doesn't really appeal to your neighbors or parents. </p>
<p> Go ahead and file this one in the Super Cool Tech category. A Russian blog, Rozetked.ru, posted video of a Galaxy S2 running two copies of Android at the same time. The three-and-a-half minute video takes us through a demo switching between a pair of ROMs while playing music from both, proving that the hardware resources can be shared. After the audio segment, we are shown decently high frame rates on a 3D benchmarking app and Angry Birds. According to the team behind the project, running two concurrent instances of Android only takes about 10% off of battery life while the impact on system speed is negligible. </p>
<p> If you've ever dreamed of syncing your Android apps and games up with your PC and using them on a larger screen you'll be excited to hear that your dreams are becoming a very well-designed reality. Actually, if you've been following along with the development of BlueStacks then you know that this dream-to-reality transition has been in the works for several months now. </p>
<p> For those of you that don't know exactly what BlueStacks App Player is, it's exactly what the title implies - an app player that allows you to run Android applications on Windows (a Mac version is also in the works). </p>
<p> Have you been tempted by the recent onslaught of Honeycomb tablets entering the market, but forced yourself to hold back due to the lack of virtualization options available on the platform? No, neither have I (held back, that is), but these 'pro' applications always help when using a tablet, right? </p>
<p> VMWare users will be no doubt be delighted to hear about the arrival of VMWare View on the Android Market, which has been designed and developed from the ground up to give Honeycomb users the best possible experience when accessing their virtual Windows desktops on the go. </p>
<p> Currently available from the Market as a free tech preview, the application utilizes the PCoIP protocol so that you can control your computer effectively whether you're on a fast WiFi network or a slower 3G connection, as it adapts the quality of the connection depending on how much bandwidth you have available. </p>
<p> If you've been looking for a 7 inch tablet without the bells and whistles of the HTC Flyer or the newly announced ASUS Eee Pad MeMO 3D, then it looks like ViewSonic may have your number, as it has just announced its newest Honeycomb tablet: the 7-inch ViewPad 7x. </p>
<p> ViewSonic ViewPad 7x </p>
<p> The ViewPad 7x is pretty cut-and-dry as far as Android tablets are concerned - just in a smaller package. It's packing a 1GHz Tegra 2 processor under its hood, along with a 7 inch, 1024x600 display, HDMI out, microUSB, and support for HSPA+. </p>
<p> ViewSonic 10Pro </p>
<p> If the 7x isn't your thing, however, ViewSonic has also announced a second tablet - the 10 inch, Intel Oak Trail sporting 10Pro. </p>

The promise is now closer to reality, with the Parallels Desktop for Chromebook Enterprise set to be released this fall. </p>
<p> Even though Chrome OS is based on Linux (Gentoo Linux, to be exact), you can't run traditional desktop Linux applications. One solution to this problem is Crouton, a script that sets up a chroot of Ubuntu or Debian Linux on top of Chrome OS. While this does allow many people to use Chrome OS who otherwise couldn't, it's a hacky solution and requires enabling Developer Mode (which turns off most of Chrome OS' security features). </p>
<p> Jide's Remix OS has turned a lot of heads in the last couple of years, thanks to an interesting initial tablet offering and subsequent easy-to-install software for both PCs and a few Nexus tablets and even some retail hardware. The modified Android software, which uses a desktop-style window system for apps, is surprisingly robust and easy to use. Jide's latest move is to offer Remix as a virtual machine package, allowing Windows desktops, laptops, and tablets to run the Android ROM in a dedicated window alongside desktop applications. </p>
<p> Windows Phone, eat your heart out. Android is now capable of virtualizing a full and up-to-date Windows desktop operating system. Well, one phone is at least, and it's probably not one you would have guessed: the ASUS ZenFone 2. XDA-Developers forum member ycavan managed to get Windows 7 running on his phone using a variety of custom tools, some impressive technical skill, and quite a lot of patience. Check it out in the video below: </p>
<p> To be clear, this is Windows 7, virtualized, running on a local virtual machine client accessed via the aSPICE KVM client for control. Windows is not being emulated (it's been done with older versions). </p>
<p> If you're not an IT manager or an employee of a company with a sizeable tech infrastructure, feel free to skip this post. But if either of those descriptions fit you, you may be interested in Amazon's latest foray into B2B services. Amazon WorkSpaces is a remote, virtualized desktop - basically your own personal Windows machine that lives in the cloud - and it's got an Android client just one day after the service was launched. </p>
<p> From an end user perspective, WorkSpaces is very similar to all the other remote desktop apps out there, except that you're not logging into a physical machine. </p>
<p> A few days ago, I posted about a student project at a Russian University that aims to run two or more instances of Android at the same time on a single device. It's a technology called virtualization, and we already use it on web servers and developer machines everywhere. </p>

<p> This morning we told you about RIM's plan to bring Blackberry Enterprise Solution to Android and iOS, with a brief mention of Android apps running on the Playbook. No sooner than we posted the aforementioned article did we find out that RIM had demonstrated just that at Blackberry World Conference. Take a look at the video: </p>
<p> Each Android app will run in its own virtual machine, but will seamlessly integrate into the Blackberry ecosystem. The Playbook doesn't have access to the Android Market, either - all compatible Android Apps will be available through the Blackberry App World. This does mean a bit more headache for developers, though, as they will now have to submit their apps not only to Google for the Android Market, but also to RIM to be accepted into App World. </p>
<p> Some combinations are as natural as peanut butter and jelly - Avatar & 3D, Apple & dictatorship, and Conan O'Brien & late-night comedy, to name a few. But are Android apps and the BlackBerry PlayBook also such a sweet match? If you ask RIM, the answer is a firm, definitive "yes." </p>
<p> The BlackBerry maker just confirmed the age-old rumors - it's announced that the upcoming QNX-based PlayBook tablet will support Android apps. There are, however, certain limitations - while the process doesn't sound overly complicated, developers of existing Android apps will need to put some work in to porting their software over, namely "repackaging, code signing, and submitting" it to the BlackBerry App World. </p>
<p> About 2 weeks ago, BGR broke the rumor of RIM's upcoming tablet, the BlackBerry PlayBook, possibly being capable of running Android apps sometime after launch, which the latest rumors put at the end of March/beginning of April with a price sticker of $499.99. The company was seriously looking into this possibility and was trying to decide whether using the Dalvik virtual machine (the same one Android uses to run its apps) was a viable way to move forward. BGR is usually very credible, so the rumor definitely had legs. </p>
<p> Today, 2 weeks later, Bloomberg revealed that their own sources - in fact, 3 of them - have confirmed that RIM is indeed moving in the direction BGR predicted. </p>

<p> virtual private network </p>
<p> Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs for short, are incredibly useful. They're even more useful when you're stuck at home, as you can access the internet from different parts of the world without leaving your couch. Want to watch a Netflix series that isn't available in your country or keep your ISP from snooping? You can do those and more with the right VPN. </p>
<p> We've heard a number of rumors about Google launching its own Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO), codenamed Nova. According to reports, the service will source wireless service from Sprint and T-Mobile, but it will rely on Wi-Fi networks to bear most of the weight of both data and voice services (though VoIP). While the details of this plan still aren't clear, another piece of the puzzle just emerged that indicates Google is going to offer its own virtual private network (VPN) service, and it may be targeted specifically at Nova subscribers. </p>
<p> This information resulted from a tip we received a few days ago, pointing us in the direction of a new application called Google Connectivity Services. </p>
<p> People regularly rely on Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to hide their activities from nosy governments, circumvent geographically restricted and region-locked services, and increase security on untrusted Wi-Fi networks. But the big problem with piping your communications through a secure digital tunnel is that it's an all-or-nothing deal – web browsing, IM chats, and email are all going over the wire to the same place. That can become a really serious issue for people that use an employer's VPN for work. With Android 5.0 Lollipop, VPN clients can finally offer granular control over which apps communicate over a secured network, and which apps connect to the Internet directly. </p>

<p> virtual vacation </p>
<p> With all of us stuck at home because of the Coronavirus pandemic, a supermarket run is starting to feel like the biggest excursion and adventure we can go on for the foreseeable future. Travel is out of the question, local trips are restricted in many countries, and even the simple idea of stepping out of your house is as daunting as an alcohol and paranoia party. I've been yearning for a vacation for a while — I even had a trip planned for May before all of this went down — but since that's been canceled now, I've found myself thumbing through old pics and 360 photos I've taken during my trips, reminiscing about better times and nicer places, then it occurred to me that I could do something similar but also discover new countries and cities I've never visited, all through the magic of Google Maps, Earth, and Street View. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/07/24 3:37am PDTon Jul 24, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/28 2:02am PDTon Jul 28, 2020. </p>
<p> If you tried to sync your Garmin fitness band or smartwatch to the company's servers over the last few days, you may have noticed that something's awry. After initial reports pointed to a ransomware attack (via ZDNet), Garmin has now publicly confirmed that it's been hit by a cyber attack and that it's working to bring its servers back online over the next few days. </p>
<p> Researchers at Kaspersky Lab have identified a family of modular Android malware dubbed "Loapi," which is capable of mining the Monero cryptocurrency, inundating users with advertisements, automatically subscribing the user to paid services, and participating in DDoS attacks, among other functions. The cryptocurrency mining module maintains a load sufficiently high enough to cause physical damage to a test device after two days—the above photo shows a device which overheated to the point the battery bulged. </p>
<p> Computer security is important, even if the computer in question fits in your hand. There should be no doubt about that fact. However, you should be just as wary of security software as any other app. Case in point: there's a slick new app in the Play Store called Virus Shield. It's got a cool look and it's easy to operate. Just press a single button and your virus shield is activated. </p>
<p> You hear a lot of reports about malware and other undesirable third-party apps these days, especially from security researchers (and people who want to sell you something to make you feel safe). It's undeniable that malicious apps are a problem on an open system, but new data from Google indicates that the amount of actual harm being done might be negligible. QZ.com reports on a presentation from Google's Android Security Chief Adrian Ludwig at the Virus Conference in Berlin. He estimates that .001% of Android apps are able to get past Google's defenses. </p>
<p> A new piece of Android malware has been discovered by security researchers at Kaspersky Labs. That by itself wouldn't be big news, but this Trojan does things no other malicious app has done. It exploits multiple vulnerabilities, blocks uninstall attempts, attempts to gain root access, and can execute a host of remote commands. Backdoor.AndroidOS.Obad.a, as it has been dubbed, is the most sophisticated piece of Android malware ever seen. </p>
<p> There are two previously unknown Android vulnerabilities exploited by Obad. The malware installer contains a modified AndroidManifest.xml file, which is a part of every Android apps. The first big vulnerability is in the processing of this file by the system – it shouldn't be processed at all, but the app installs just fine. </p>
<p> We talked a little bit about Bitdefender's new antivirus offering earlier today in our giveaway post, but now we want to dive a little deeper into the app and explain what makes it good, how it differs from Bitdefender's paid mobile security service, and how it compares to similar antivirus offerings. </p>
<p> The first question you may have is "since Bitdefender's Mobile Security app was already free(mium), why release this?" That answer is actually pretty simple: as of today, the model for Mobile Security has changed to a trial period-only. Basically, you can try the full suite for two weeks, and after that are presented with the option to buy. </p>
<p> We've got an LG Nexus system dump and endless desire to spoil every Googley surprise we can. Today's edition of the Android 4.2 Teardown could be alternatively subtitled "The Super-Serious Security Edition," because we're talking about the sort of stuff that should make your sysadmin jump for joy. </p>
<p> Please keep in mind this is just as forward-facing and time-ambiguous as all my other teardowns. This is a list of new stuff in the 4.2 dump, not a list of "confirmed for 4.2" features. Anything could be cut or not fully implemented by the time 4.2 rolls around; similarly to how bits of Android are currently multi-user aware, yet multi-user functionality isn't accessible. </p>
<p> A new app update means a new APK Teardown here at AP. Today's victim is the Google Play Store, which was just freshly updated to 3.9.16. We've got all sorts of stuff to talk about. </p>
<p> A Built-In Malware Scanner </p>
<p> Yes, it's hard to believe, but Google is working on a malware scanner for the Play Store. The string file doesn't lie: </p>
<p> <string name="package_malware_title">App Check</string> <string name="package_malware_consent_text">"Allow Google to check all apps installed to this device for harmful behavior? To learn more, go to Settings > Security."</string> <string name="package_malware_banner_warning">Installing this app may harm your device</string> <string name="package_malware_banner_blocked">Installation has been blocked</string> <string name="package_malware_recommendation_warning">Google recommends that you do not install this app.</string> </p>
<p> Even if you haven't played it before, there's a decent chance you've seen Plague Inc. around the internet. Usually, it involves seeing a screenshot that informs you your mom has killed thousands of people. If you've ever wondered how you—yes, you!—can also create silly-named diseases that annihilate Earth's population with your Android phone, the answer has arrived! Go here, download the game, then spend 15 minutes staring at the screen trying to come up with something clever. Fair warning: "BieberFever" has already been done to death. </p>
<p> Of course, there is actually a game part to this game. The action is rather slow-going at first, but that's the point. </p>
<p> We at Android Police take our mobile security pretty seriously. It's in the job description. Entering the realm of mobile security today is yet another contender on the good side of the battle: VirusTotal has released its client for Android. Prior to this, VirusTotal was a simple website where you can upload suspicious files to be scanned by a multitude of antivirus engines. Having provided this desktop OS-oriented service for several years now, VirusTotal has brought its experience and expertise to mobile. </p>
<p> However, its mobile offering is slightly different than its desktop counterpart. As mobile devices are often data-limited, VirusTotal for Android instead checks an identifying hash of each application installed on your mobile device against the website's database. </p>

<p> Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, the team plans on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. </p>
<p> It never fails. You're walking along, reading your emails, not looking where you're going, and then boom! You trip over the cat and land nose-first into his empty food bowl. Transparent Screen aims to prevent this type of misstep by letting you see through your camera while you're walking. Unfortunately, it can't fix your cat's passive aggressive behavior, but we're sure an app like that is in the works. </p>
<p> We've seen apps like this before, usually designed for texting and walking only. This app's approach, however, is to make your entire Android experience translucent. As you can see in the screenshots above, no matter where you are in the OS, you'll be able to see through your rear-facing camera. </p>

<p> Vision </p>
<p> Huawei is a very interesting company. They're heavily subsidized by the Chinese government. There's been a lot of controversy surrounding their products in terms of intellectual property infringement and military ties. </p>
<p> And then they go and unveil this thing, the Huawei Vision - and, as the title says, it bears a striking resemblance (from the front, at least) to a certain other phone: </p>
<p> Take a look at the top tier of Android phones right now and you might notice something. They all kind of look the same. Black front fascia, large touchscreen, minimal waistline. Boring, right? Well that's just the way things are going. Alternatives to the slate way of living are becoming increasingly rare, which puts the HTC Desire Z with its hardware keyboard in an intriguing light. With its metallic accents and suave grey pallet, the Desire Z cuts a different path. </p>
<p> Who says the G2's processor is slow, eh? While its stock 800 MHz clockspeed didn't break any benchmark records, it's showing itself to be nicely capable of overclocking. Unlike the QSD8250 in the original Snapdragon, which gets rather unstable anywhere past the 1.13GHz (+15%) mark, the MSM7230 in the Scorpion of the G2 sails right on past +100% with apparent stability. The kernel was posted on XDA-Developers by member Flippy125, with the usual "NOT MY FAULT IF-" disclaimers, but also noting that the kernel runs stably for him. </p>
<p> You're probably aware of one of the slightly more irksome facets of the G2 that is stymying attempts at custom ROMs, namely the locked down /system partition, where the OS is kept. Heretofore it has been impossible to tinker with this internal memory in a permanent fashion. All alterations were reverted on the next boot, leading to solutions like Paul O'Brien's VISIONary soft-root. </p>
<p> Well, Mr. O'Brien isn't the kind of fellow you can restrain with NAND lockdowns, and with a flourish today he unveiled his latest hack. </p>
<p> This article deals with a couple of advanced topics. If you’re unfamiliar with some of the terms, hit up our primers here: </p>
<p> With the G2 already getting a non-persistent "soft-root" solution, it was only a matter of time before someone combined it into a nice, user-friendly package. Stepping up to the plate (or rather, the crease) is Paul O'Brien, the founder of UK smartphone website MoDaCo, well known for a myriad of clever hacks. </p>
<p> Superusers, you can haz them </p>
<p> Deriving its name from the HTC Vision device codename, VISIONary is a simple one-click temporary root app for the T-Mobile G2. </p>
<p> Seems like the HTC phones are really taking up the lions share of Android news lately, doesn't it? First the G2 was rooted, and shortly after we learned that HTC did its best to prevent perma-rooting. And just this morning, we heard word that the Desire HD and Z are both being delayed. Quite a mouthful, we know - but now that you're up to speed: an enterprising individual by the name of kholk over at XDA-Devs has come up with a root method for the HTC Desire Z. </p>
<p> Over at XDA-Developers, Hitorii just got his sweet new T-Mobile G2. Naturally, before even opening the box, he went and told everyone about it. Wouldn't you? I am super jealous, anyway. </p>
<p> He also made a neat new discovery that we had not heard of before: the trackpad has an LED surround, which glows white on new notifications. He wasn't able to get it to glow any other colour, even using apps that do have coloured notifications, so it looks like the LED is not the same as the RGB light of the Nexus One. </p>
<p> While the teaser site for the T-Mobile G2 has been up for quite some time now, HTC, the company actually manufacturing the device, have been quite reticent about its specifications and what’s driving that stock Froyo goodness. Of course, we’ve known of its MSM7230 and various other details for a couple of weeks, but it’s nice to see the official specs solidified on HTC’s website. There are no surprises contained within, but something about the confirmation of what was once nebulous rumour can’t help but bring a warming pulse to every Android’s circuitry. </p>
<p> It’s not uncommon to see the big chains try to get a piece of the smartphone launch action with price reductions by mail-in-rebate. However, the hassle that this process usually entails doesn’t make things all that enticing to customers. Thankfully pre-orders for the G2 aren’t yet open on T-Mobile’s website, so prospective buyers now have the pleasure in knowing they’ll be able to get in instant discount with RadioShack, bringing the price down to $149.99 on a two year contract. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/08/06 3:10am PDTon Aug 6, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/06 8:16am PDTon Oct 6, 2020. </p>
<p> It's been years since Google started migrating the good ol' Google Now functionality into Assistant. Over time, the feed of relevant contextual cards has had many official names ranging from Your Stuff to Upcoming to Snapshot, and even more unofficial names (inbox, updates, dashboard). One thing remained unchanged though, and that's the fact that you couldn't customize a thing about it. This has changed now. </p>
<p> Snapshot in the Google Assistant is picking up a handful of new cards, according to our friends at 9to5Google. Additions include a more widely expanded "audio pics" card with playlists from YouTube Music, news, and podcasts, a card for upcoming sports events, and a "do it again" card for Assistant commands you commonly perform, similar to the suggested actions notification which rolled out earlier this summer. </p>
<p> Google Assistant's visual snapshot feature is intended to be a daily feed that provides you with all the necessary info you need to go about your day. Along with the weather, reminders, and upcoming appointments, the visual snapshot now includes...recipe suggestions. I mean, who doesn't like a good pizza recipe to start their day? Unfortunately, you can't remove it. </p>
<p> Google has toyed with Assistant's interface on Android countless times so far, adding a keyboard input method, Google Lens, then the Explore section, and finally the Now-like interface of upcoming cards (aka "visual snapshot"). But two things have puzzled me about it: one is that Explore and Visual Snapshot were almost invisible to people and I always had to explain where the icons were and what the did, and two is that getting to your Assistant's settings was an even more obscure process, and it was almost easier to just do it from the Google Home app than Assistant. Well, it seems that Google is working on solving at least the first of these problems. </p>
<p> The one-swipe convenience of the old Google Now was one of the most magical parts of using Android back in the day, and its devolution into the Feed was a reason of sadness for many, including myself. Although most of its features were still hidden away in the Google app, checking your calendar, packages, or flight status was no longer just a swipe away. Thankfully, Google pretty much brought it back last month in something it calls "visual snapshot" via the Assistant. And now Google is testing a new, more convenient way of accessing it with a swipe up on the Assistant overlay. </p>

<p> Microsoft is in the midst of its annual Build conference. This is sort of like Google I/O or WWDC, but with fewer online viewers. Wednesday's keynote presentation was filled with announcements about Windows 10, the Microsoft Edge browser, an augmented reality headset, and quite a bit more. One product failed to earn stage time: the Visual Studio Emulator for Android, but developers may find renewed interest since the latest version is showing maturity as it expands through the addition of Device Profiles and a number of other recent enhancements. </p>
<p> When it comes to software development, there are two very distinct camps on the subject of tools: those who prefer to keep it simple with just a text editor and a compiler, and then those who go straight for a fully-featured IDE with all the bells and whistles. For more than a decade, the undisputed champion of IDEs is Microsoft with its assorted versions of Visual Studio. Having come from years of work on Visual Studio, nothing pained me more than the first (several) times I started up Eclipse. </p>
<p> The majority of Android developers use Java to create their apps. While Java isn't the hardest programming language to learn, it's always best to get as many people developing as possible.... not that Android is hurting in that respect. Even so, a new way to create apps using Microsoft's familiar C# language is now available, by way of TallApplications BV's Dot42 - a tool that aims to accomplish this task without requiring something like mono. </p>

<p> Right on schedule, Sony's PlayStation Mobile is going live today, bringing PlayStation titles to certified devices and – of course – PS Vita. </p>
<p> While, at the moment, Sony's list of certified devices is limited primarily to Sony's own Android phones and tablets, more devices – including some from Fujitsu and Sharp – are expected to gain certification in the near future. HTC's One line is already on the list, with "details to be announced later on." </p>
<p> According to Pocket-lint, Sony is planning to bestow PlayStation Certification onto upcoming HTC Android smartphones by the middle of the year. What does said certification entail? </p>
<p> Basically, the PlayStation Suite project (of which PlayStation Certified hardware is a part) currently consists of a dozen or so ported PSX titles from Sony's back catalog - like Crash Bandicoot, or Syphon Filter. They work on PS Certified Android phones as well as the PlayStation Vita. </p>
<p> We certainly aren't a console video gaming blog, but when reviews of the US version of Sony's PlayStation Vita started cropping up this morning, I couldn't help but take notice of the new mobile console system's software. Particularly, how... smartphoney it looks. </p>
<p> Everything in Sony's Vita OS has been appified - Google Maps is there, while Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, and Skype apps are forthcoming. Sony has its own suite of apps as well, including a full-blown browser which, although it appears to be pretty terrible, is apparently the best on any mobile gaming device to date. </p>

<p> vivaldi android </p>
<p> Vivaldi went stable on Android this year, but the developers behind the Chromium-based browser aren't resting on their laurels. Following the introduction of a forced dark mode for all websites in June, the team is now turning its attention to making the bottom bar more consistent. It's also going more private by giving users enhanced control over tracker and ad blocking via access to additional blocklists. </p>
<p> Vivaldi is among the most customizable Chromium-based browsers out there (following Opera's example) and made the jump to Android last year in the form of a beta. After extensive testing, the makers of the browser have announced that they're launching the stable release of Vivaldi today, complete with a slew of new features first seen in the latest snapshot builds: a desktop-like tab strip at the top, built-in tracker and ad blocking, and more. </p>
<p> Vivaldi has a reputation for being an extremely customizable Chromium-based browser, all while working very fast. It was created by the same developers that brought us Opera, and shares many of those same genes. After staying exclusively on desktops for the past three years, Vivaldi is finally available as a beta on Android starting today. </p>

<p> Over the past year or so, HTC devices have become notoriously more difficult to root/mod/S-Off than the devices of yesteryear. When one series of devices gets cracked, the next generation released by HTC has historically been drastically more difficult to crack. </p>
<p> This has been the case for some of the more recent HTC devices; namely the Amaze, Rezound, Sensation/XE, Vivid/Raider/Velocity, And MyTouch 4G Slide. Up until now, a few of those devices have never even received S-Off status. </p>
<p> Those with deeper knowledge of phone commands figured out how to get the Vivid to ask the update servers for this OTA (*#*#682#*#* - 682 stands for OTA, get it?) and successfully updated, but most Vivid owners to this day probably have no idea this method even exists. </p>
<p> The HTC Vivid, one of AT&T's mid-range (if you can call it that) phones is getting an unofficial bump to ICS courtesy of, who else? XDA. User Pirateghost has offered up a flashable Android 4.0.3 ROM. Stock, rooted and ready to go. It even comes with all that AT&T carrier bloat intact. You're getting the 100% pure, unadulterated stock experience with this one, just rooted. </p>
<p> As you can see, while it reads like ICS, it hardly looks like it at all. </p>
<p> It's not unheard of for tuners to throw a small PC into a car (commonly called a "carputer" in the industry). It's a lot less common for Android to appear in cars, though it does happen - GM has considered using it to power OnStar and has a Volt app, while the Roewe 350 rocks Android in a pretty hardcore way. We've yet to hear of aftermarket tuners taking advantage of Android - until now, that is. </p>

<p> vivo 5 </p>
<p> We've been working with Blu for quite a while now, and the company has been putting out some of its best phones to date over the last few months. With the release of the Life One X (2016) and Vivo 5, Blu has once again set the bar for what a "budget" phone can — and should — be. For $150 and $200 respectively, these are two of the absolute best phones that are available on the market today in this price range. </p>
<p> This contest is now over. </p>
<p> The final results are listed below. If you've won, you will be contacted in the near future. </p>
<p> Back at CES, Blu announced two phones: the Vivo XL and Vivo 5. While we've already taken a look at the former, the latter is the one we've really been waiting for. I've had it in-hand for about a week now, and there's honestly a lot to talk about with this handset. From the specs to the design, this definitely offers more than a $200 handset should, though there are definitely some quirks with the software. </p>
<p> But I'm getting ahead of myself now. Let's start at the beginning. And when we get to the end — stop. </p>
<p> Specs </p>
<p> Display </p>
<p> 5.5-inch 1280x720 Super AMOLED with Gorilla Glass 3 </p>
<p> Processor </p>
<p> 1.3GHz octa-core Mediatek 6753 64-bit with Mali T720 GPU </p>
<p> I feel like the new Life One X was somewhat of a turning point for Blu—they've always offered good phones for the price, but the LOX is a truly great phone for the money. It launched at just $99 for the first three days, which was an absolute steal; even now at $149, it's still a great deal for a phone that performs much, much better than its price suggests. </p>
<p> Today, at the Consumer Electronics Show, Blu pretty much confirmed my thoughts (that they're going to start offering even more bang for the buck moving forward) with the announcement of the Vivo 5 and Vivo XL. </p>

<p> Garmin has long been associated with GPS navigation, but most people aren't buying standalone GPS units anymore. The company has, however, been branching out to other product categories like wearables. Garmin's Vivofit fitness trackers have been reasonably popular, and there's a new version available today. The Vivofit 4 launches at $79.99. It's a bit more expensive, but the screen is color and it still gets a year of battery life. </p>
<p> A few days ago, Garmin announced its newest wearable for kids: the vivofit jr. Despite the name being in lowercase, it sounds like a pretty neat device. Garmin claims that it is water-resistant, comfortable, durable, and that it has more than a year's worth of battery life. Like other fitness trackers, the vivofit jr. will monitor the child's steps, sleep, and physical activity. </p>

<p> In a world where competing media codecs run rampant, VLC is a lifesaver. Version 3.2 came out last year, bringing UI improvements, a new TV interface, and support for Chrome OS keyboard shortcuts among other things. Now 3.3 is ready to go, and it completes the UI revamp with a more modern Material look that's right at home on Android 11. </p>
<p> VLC is one of the best media players out there — not only can it open just about every type of video and audio file in existence, but it works on just about every platform too. VLC 3.1 is now rolling out on the Play Store, and it has plenty of useful additions. </p>
<p> Last month, possibly the most-anticipated feature for VLC finally made it into the Android version - support for Chromecast. Now the feature has reached the stable branch, with the release of VLC 3.0. It's the first major version bump since 2012, and includes plenty of new features and bug fixes. </p>
<p> Reports about the plans for the next major release of VLC Media Player indicate that support for Chromecast output is on the roadmap. This is scheduled for the v3.0 release of the popular desktop client, but it is unclear in which version to expect it to appear on Android - the beta in the Play Store is at 1.0.0. </p>
<p> While there are a bevy of changes expected in the project's jump from 2.2 (which itself is not yet released) to 3.0, of most interest to Android users and Google fans is the Chromecast capability. </p>
<p> Also of interest is the following snippet from the 2.2.x </p>

<p> Though voice control apps have been around for quite some time, it took Apple's release of Siri to bring the functionality to the mainstream. Now, competing manufacturers are trying to push out similar services. Samsung's first to the punch with a Vlingo-based "S Voice" service, though it remains to be seen how well it works. </p>
<p> Second only to Google Voice Search in terms of popularity on Android, Vlingo received a major update today. What's new? The entire UI has been streamlined into a much more intuitive list format that makes learning Vlingo's various voice command capabilities, or quickly accessing them, a breeze. </p>
<p> You can send text messages, make phone calls, find places, open apps, get directions, buy movie tickets, and more. Vlingo also includes a handy InCar mode, which you can set to activate automatically whenever your phone connects to a Bluetooth headset. </p>
<p> I recently broke down and picked up a Bluetooth headset. I needed something to talk on while driving a stick-shift or working with both my hands. I wanted to get something awesome because, honestly, it's go big or go home when it comes to Bluetooth headsets, and you get what you pay for. I paid for a Jawbone ERA, and I got the best Bluetooth experience I've ever had (and I've had every iteration of the Jawbone at one time or another). </p>
<p> The winners have been selected and contacted via email. </p>
<p> Enjoy your Vlingo licenses and look out for future AndroidPolice contests! </p>
<p> Living in Houston, you encounter some pretty horrendous traffic. Out of the 45 minutes I spend commuting(one way), about 20 are probably spent at a red light. </p>

<p> vmware </p>
<p> About a year ago, Google announced the Android Enterprise Recommended program. It includes a list of Android devices that are ideal for business use and comply with certain guidelines (running a recent version of Android, supporting zero-touch enrollment, etc.). For companies looking to deploy a large number of phones, Google also now has a set of recommended Enterprise Mobility Management providers. </p>
<p> Chromebooks have become increasingly popular in education, thanks to their ease of use for both students and IT staff. Google is looking to expand Chromebook usage in another market - businesses. Today, the company announced Chrome Enterprise, a subscription service for managing large amounts of Chrome OS devices. </p>
<p> Using a work phone and a personal phone at the same time sucks. That's the motivator behind the Bring Your Own Device ("BYOD") trend, wherein employees use their own smartphones for work-related tasks. Most people do this anyway, but it can become a real problem if you're working with sensitive data. That's where VMware comes in. This company specializes in virtualized PCs for remote access and security, and after years of development, it's expanding into mobile with Android. Too bad it's only available on Verizon at the moment - and only on two mid-range phones at that. </p>
<p> VMware's Horizon Mobile solution works like this: your company sets up a default mobile workspace, complete with apps, security measures, and even a wallpaper if they want. </p>
<p> A few days ago, I posted about a student project at a Russian University that aims to run two or more instances of Android at the same time on a single device. It's a technology called virtualization, and we already use it on web servers and developer machines everywhere. </p>
<p> At first glance, the idea sounds interesting, but seems to lack practical uses for the majority of people. Sure, some developers will save a few hours on testing, and industrious users might want to run the latest CyanogenMod nightly ROM alongside their daily driver, but this kind of stuff doesn't really appeal to your neighbors or parents. </p>
<p> Have you been tempted by the recent onslaught of Honeycomb tablets entering the market, but forced yourself to hold back due to the lack of virtualization options available on the platform? No, neither have I (held back, that is), but these 'pro' applications always help when using a tablet, right? </p>
<p> VMWare users will be no doubt be delighted to hear about the arrival of VMWare View on the Android Market, which has been designed and developed from the ground up to give Honeycomb users the best possible experience when accessing their virtual Windows desktops on the go. </p>
<p> Currently available from the Market as a free tech preview, the application utilizes the PCoIP protocol so that you can control your computer effectively whether you're on a fast WiFi network or a slower 3G connection, as it adapts the quality of the connection depending on how much bandwidth you have available. </p>

<p> Vodafone Android 2.2 </p>
<p> After Vodafone deployed an HTC Desire update last week that was full of crapware, customers responded with understandable anger. After initially standing firm on the crapware (“Vodafone 360”), Vodafone has now backed off and will remove it with the next update. The next update? Vanilla Froyo - and it’s coming in 7-10 days. </p>
<p> The surprising thing here is that the update will apparently be an unmolested version of Android 2.2 - something they elected not to do with their Nexus One update. </p>
<p> Vodafone Germany has been sending out a few interesting tweets lately, and the official word seems to be that Android 2.2 should be rolling out to Nexus One users sometime in the next few days (presumably, those are business days). Granted, we’re working with Google Translate on this one, but it’s probably safe to assume the translation is solid. </p>
<p> I’m a bit surprised there’s even a fuss at all, as the finalized FroYo update has only been rolling out to US N1 users for a short while, and no other phones have yet to receive official FroYo. </p>

<p> voice control </p>
<p> Google will discontinue Play Music this month, and as such, the company is hard at work improving YouTube Music. One of these enhancements revolves around casting and Google Assistant. Songs you ask the Assistant to play while you cast will now show up in your YouTube Music queue on your phone, and when you start playback via the Assistant, you can tap into the queue by casting to the speaker or display in question. </p>
<p> The coronavirus pandemic ruffled Chrome and Chrome OS releases quite a bit, so Google paused updates for a short time, even omitting version 82 altogether. But now the company is getting back on track and has announced the release of Chrome OS 83. It'll start rolling out to first people this week, and it brings a whole slew of neat improvements to the table. None of them are as big as the addition of gesture navigation we've seen in version 81, though. </p>
<p> These days, you can control most of your smart home using only your voice — Google Assistant lets you adjust your bed, mow the lawn, open your closets, start your Xbox, control your TV, and so much more. Routers and networks are the latest new addition to the Assistant's library of natively supported actions, allowing for things like reboots, software updates, and parental controls on third-party networking devices. </p>
<p> With Google Assistant pre-installed on any Android phone (and Siri on iPhones), you should think you already have all tools at your disposal when you want to yell at your phone to control your audio playback. However, Spotify seems to think that it needs its own solution. App reverse-engineer Jane Manchun Wong managed to activate a hidden settings panel in the music app that will let you enable a "Hey Spotify" feature you can use while the app is open and on your screen. </p>
<p> Over time, major TV, movie, and video service providers have been rolling out Google Assistant voice support so that users can access their favorite content on Chromecasts and Google Home smart displays simply by speaking. Just last month, Sling added its service to Google's growing list of companies, and today, Hulu has officially hopped onto the roster, as well. </p>
<p> Cutting the cord is a difficult decision, but Sling makes it easier. Its service offers live TV so there's no need to give up on football, your local stations, or the 24-hour news cycle. Sling has supported Chromecast for some time now, and today the company is adding voice control options as well as the ability to stream on your Google Assistant smart displays. </p>
<p> We've known since June that Microsoft was working on integrating Alexa and Google Assistant with Xbox in lieu of its own voice assistant, Cortana. With Alexa support already up and running on Xbox One, it's now time for Google Assistant to get in on the action. </p>
<p> The Ecobee4 has been our go-to smart thermostat here at Android Police for quite a while. Its connectivity with various smart home protocols and integrated Alexa voice controls round off the device's temperature regulation capabilities, making it one of the best smart thermostats around. Today, Ecobee has announced the successor to its successful two-year-old product, and true to the proverb "if it ain't broke, don't fix it," not much has changed. The thermostat comes with a modest redesign, the same Alexa integration, improved processing power, and better sound. </p>
<p> IFA 2018 may be over, but there are still some interesting tidbits of news worth mentioning. One of the stands we visited briefly in Berlin last week was that of German Autolabs to see an interesting new product. It may resemble a Nest Thermostat, but Chris is actually a digital assistant for your car. </p>

<p> Voice controls are easily one of the best things to have happened to the living room. Gone are the times when we needed separate 'clickers' for every device, and even the universal remote's days are numbered. Now you can even add Hulu on Android TV to the growing list of "yell-compatible" apps, via the Google Assistant. </p>
<p> A couple of weeks ago, I got my hands on Google Home and immediately set out to use it and record my initial impressions. Now that I've given this odd little device a chance to prove its worth in my home, the time has come to finish the review. Out of the gate, I must confess to a little personal surprise at just how little my opinions have changed from the first 24 hours I had to spend with the device. As such, I'm not going to repeat everything I said in my first post. This is an addendum. I will touch on all of the subjects again and add details where there is more to say – because there is still a lot to say. </p>
<p> Google Home preorders have started arriving and interested consumers can head down to certain brick & mortar stores to pick one up starting today. I've been messing with Home for a little while and I feel like there's already quite a bit to say about it. </p>
<p> Today Amazon unveiled what may be its most peculiar hardware to date, and it's not what you would expect. It's... wait, did you hear that? </p>
<p> Sorry, it was just an Echo. </p>
<p> Amazon Echo is a cylindrical speaker that responds to your voice commands. If you want music, tell it what to play. If you want to know the weather, ask it the question. It can handle alarms, pull up information from Wikipedia, or update you on the news. All you have to do is say its name and ask. </p>

<p> voip </p>
<p> Whether you run a business from your personal Android device or work for a company that supplies a phone, it's important to always have access to your clients and customers whenever they need you most. Especially for younger businesses, missing a call or having a conversation interrupted by a shoddy signal could spell disaster for your brand's reputation. To help you manage your business communications from the convenience of your smartphone, Zadarma offers an intuitive VoIP telecom service backed by 12 years of evolution and proven success. </p>
<p> Google took a long, long break from Google Voice a while back. After letting the app fall into disrepair, Google expressed a renewed commitment to Voice in 2017. It has since announced a handful of feature updates, including VoIP calling in 2018. However, that feature never actually rolled out to everyone. Google's Scott Johnston says it's almost time, though. </p>
<p> It's always been hard to explain what Google Voice is because it feels like a VoIP service, but it's not. Google Voice has operated as a phonecall relay system all these years, forwarding your calls through another number. Earlier this year, Google started beta testing Wi-Fi calls in Google Voice, and it looks like the feature is rolling out to more users. </p>
<p> For mobile users juggling a bunch of different devices, Google Voice can be something of a godsend. Not only does it let you share a single point of contact through which people can reach you no matter which phone or tablet you're carrying at the moment, but it does so without requiring the party on the other end to install a specific app — everything travels over regular voice calls and text messages. </p>
<p> Good things are happening with Google Voice. While the app normally stays fairly quiet, the last few months have shown a lot of positive attention is going into the service. The surface-level changes in this update aren't too major, but a teardown shows that users will soon get a vastly improved voicemail system that features on-device recording and support for multiple messages. </p>
<p> Google has been dabbling in the realm of Internet-based calling for years. First it was Gmail, then Hangouts got in on the action. While there were ways (and even third-party products) to use the Google Voice service for VoIP, it was probably the least enjoyable calling experience we've seen that didn't involve MacGyver-style shorting of exposed wires to dial a number. Now an update to the Google Voice app reveals that it's finally going to make its VoIP capabilities an official feature, and it'll be usable directly from your phone without any hacky workarounds. </p>
<p> If you're not a Sprint customer who's in-tune with all the carrier's quirks and features, you probably haven't heard of Calling PLUS. After all, only three phones currently support it - that is, until now. The LG G6 has become the fourth Sprint phone to support Calling PLUS with this latest update. </p>
<p> Until recently, changing the number associated with your Viber account would mean losing your chat history. That would be very frustrating for heavy users with lots of conversations. Since the v.7.3 update, released earlier this month, it's been possible to back up up your data and take it with you when changing numbers. </p>
<p> Up to now, the most annoying part of using Uber is when a passenger and driver can't find each other and need to get in touch. Or maybe you want to let your driver know a specific detail about your location ahead of their arrival. There exists the option to use each other's phone numbers for a text or call, but this will come up as an unknown number for either recipient and could go unanswered. The obvious solution to this problem has finally arrived, as Uber has developed an in-app messaging service. </p>
<p> Late yesterday IFTTT saw a huge update. There are more than 30 new services tied to the automation tool via the new Data Access Project, including a ton of government and travel data sources. There is even a new Google Photos service that interfaces with the platform, as well as a VoIP feature for applets that use the phone service. Now you can set up IFTTT alerts on subjects like the economy and public transit, as well as upload images to Google Photos. </p>

<p> When Android 10 was released, a handful of features spotted in the earlier betas weren't present. According to a bit of digging the by the folks at XDA Developers, some of those features including the Tasker-like "Rules" and built-in screen recorder may still be planned, as they were spotted on videos posted to a Google Photos page linked to by an internal version of the Google Camera app, which has since been taken down. </p>
<p> Android's L release is going to bring about a ton of new changes and improvements, and they took time to talk about a few of the most important today. That includes a new default runtime, improved graphics, and improved battery life. </p>
<p> ART is now the default runtime </p>
<p> We actually saw this coming, but it's now confirmed. ART brings twice the performance over the current runtime, Dalvik. It has been available as a preview for KitKat, but is becoming the default (and from what I can tell, only) runtime in the L release. It's more memory efficient, more flexible, and faster. Even older devices will benefit from this. </p>

<p> volume </p>
<p> Android gives you separate volume control for media, notifications, and alarms, but Google appears to be working on adding a fourth slider to the mix. The AOSP Android 11 code suggests that the company is at least considering to add dedicated volume control for voice assistants, including but not limited to Google Assistant. </p>
<p> We've already covered well over 200 changes in the public betas of Android Q, but many of those are smaller tweaks that aren't quite important enough to be covered in dedicated posts. Following our coverage of Beta 1, 2, and 3, here are all the minor changes in Android Q Beta 4. </p>
<p> One annoying quirk with 2-in-1 Chromebooks (and Chrome OS tablets) has been with how volume controls work. The volume up/down buttons always stay in the same position, even if you flip the device around — for example, when I used to have my Asus C302 in tablet mode, pressing where the volume up button should be actually turned the sound level down. Thankfully, this papercut is close to going away forever. </p>
<p> Less than a month after the first one, Android Q Beta 2 has landed with a decent amount of changes in tow. Among those changes is a convenient new volume pop-up to control all of the different volumes without having to enter the settings app. </p>
<p> The recently-released Android P developer preview 4 is meant to be one of the last two release candidates—according to Google's initial released timeline—and in general that means polishing up existing features more than introducing a lot of new ones. Even so, a few new tweaks are present in this latest build, like a new slider for controlling call volume in Settings -> Sound. </p>
<p> Since Android P's inception, we've written over 100 feature spotlight posts about various new changes Google has added in. Even in its third developer preview, lots of changes are still being added, but some are so minor they don't really warrant their own posts. However, if you like nitpicking every little thing like many of us, this might be the post for you. </p>
<p> Ten days have passed since we started digging into the Android P developer preview release, and while we've enjoyed many of the new changes and shared with you our five favorites, there are other modifications that left us scratching our heads a little. This is a developer preview, so things are expected to be buggy, some features could be experimental and could change with the next releases, but there are others that might be here to stay. </p>
<p> We've scoured our long, long list of Android P posts looking for those that we either don't like or that many of you voiced disapproval for. </p>
<p> Android's separate volumes for media, calls, and alarms can be great in some situations and terrible in others. I'm sure many of you have tried to preemptively turn down the volume as a YouTube video is loading, only to set your phone to vibrate and have the video play at full volume anyways. Nine years after Android was first released, this problem has finally been solved. </p>

<p> volume control </p>
<p> One of the things that first struck me about MX Player, when I tried it out many years ago, was its swiping gestures on each side of the screen. Instead of looking for physical volume buttons or pausing the video to find the brightness controls on my phone, a simple swipe would adjust those without skipping a second. These same gestures are now available in Android's built-in video player. </p>
<p> Choosing and setting up widgets is one of the joys of using Android over iOS, so you shouldn't neglect them — and you've got a broader range of top-quality widgets to choose from than you might have realized. We've picked out some of our favorites, and they all bring something genuinely useful and functional to your home screen. </p>
<p> Logitech's Harmony universal remotes are powerful devices that let you throw away the different remotes you have for your entire entertainment center and replace them with just one. However, if you own Sonos speakers, you may have noticed an issue over the past few weeks: your Harmony remote suddenly seems unable to properly control your speaker. </p>
<p> The Google Clock app received an update earlier today to version 4.4, bringing with it an assortment of odd little changes. There are some new features, a couple of adjustments to text and animations. However, the one thing that may deserve the most attention is a fairly significant size decrease. As always, you can grab the apk at the bottom of the post if it's not yet available to you through the Play Store. </p>
<p> The significance of SoundHUD becomes apparent only when you pay ridiculously close attention to Android news. As I'm sure most of you do, this will all fit together nicely. SoundHUD picks up where the now-defunct Noyze left off to make it easier to control the volume on your device. It also adds a simple way to get silent mode (more or less) back on Lollipop. </p>

<p> Looks like Verizon's on a roll – two OTAs in the same day! Earlier today, it updated the support docs for the original Stratosphere with details of an upcoming incremental update, and now it looks like Jelly Bean is getting ready to hit the airwaves on its way to the LG Spectrum 2. </p>
<p> Aside from Jelly Bean goodies, the update also packs a few fixes and tweaks: </p>
<p> + Weather application and widget have been updated + NFC LG Tag+ help has been improved + Brightness option has been moved to notification panel for global access + Browser now loads Google account bookmarks + Improved readability for email conversation + Optimized Bluetooth® connect/disconnect and audio stream switching implementations + User can back up contacts when the SIM is swapped to a new device + Preloaded widgets including Social+, Today+, Finance, News and Power Control have been removed </p>
<p> Once Big Red updates its support docs, that usually means an OTA is imminent – this one should likely start heading out sometime this week. </p>

<p> v-squared </p>
<p> The Saygus V-Squared smartphone, which debuted with an intriguing presentation at CES a year and a half ago and was still being changed and promised at MWC in February, still isn't available. Of course it isn't. It's coming any day now, it really is, right after Valve releases Half-Life 3, Apple makes a combination television-car, and Google brings Fiber to [insert your town here]. But Team Saygus is insistent that the development process continues, as evidenced by their latest tweet. </p>
<p> Saygus, the company that really will have an actual smartphone for sale any day now, they totally promise, has some more promises for you. A press release issued at Mobile World Congress lays out a series of improvements to the crowdfunded V-Squared phone, which should be easy to implement since the phone still isn't finished despite a first quarter manufacturing target. No less than four, count 'em, four new features have been introduced since... last year's Mobile World Congress. The fact that Saygus has missed multiple ship dates between now and then is conspicuously absent from the press release. </p>
<p> Those features are "waterproofing" (an interesting claim, since every other manufacturer has the sense to cover their asses with the term "water-resistant"), Android 6.0 software, dual-SIM card slots (a popular feature for unlocked and low-cost phones outside the US), and a USB Type-C port, a la that OnePlus 2. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/vu/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484546" filename="vu">
<p> Vu </p>
<p> Picture this: you're setting the screensaver on your Android TV to show pictures from your Google Photos account, but wait — the account selection page shows hundreds of unknown Google accounts, complete with profile pictures, all showing as linked accounts! This is exactly what happened to at least two Android TV users, on television sets from Vu and iFFalcon (a subsidiary of TCL). </p>
<p> LG's Vu series is a bit of an oddball thanks to its 4:3 aspect ratio, an idea that even Apple has abandoned on its phones. But the company seems intent on making it work for at least one more device, and so we get the LG Vu 3, shorn of Optimus branding like the flagship G2. And that's not the only thing that the Vu 3 has in common with the G2. </p>
<p> For one thing, the screen is also 5.2" diagonally, though of course it will be considerably wider and shorter thanks to that paper-style aspect ratio. It also has a considerably lower resolution at 1280x960, though that beats the previous members of the Vu family. </p>
<p> In a short press release sent out this evening, LG announced that it would be ditching the word (is it a word?) "Optimus" from its premium branding, opting to keep only the "G". </p>
<p> Furthermore, the release reaffirms the name of the company's upcoming flagship – G2. </p>
<p> The release contained one other tidbit – going forward, "LG's premium 4:3 display smartphones will be rebranded as simply 'Vu'." Yes, there will be at least one more Vu, if not more. </p>
<p> In case you were worried, LG assures customers that current smartphones will not be renamed as a result of the new branding effort. </p>
<p> The LG Optimus Vu, which launched on Verizon as the LG Intuition with Verizon earlier this month, was undoubtedly a strange device. Taking a page from Samsung's – ahem – note book, LG created the Vu for the phablet market, but decided to go with a somewhat awkward 4:3 aspect ratio, adding to the device's laundry list of quirks. </p>
<p> Well, the Korean manufacturer has just officially announced the Vu's successor – the Optimus Vu II. While it's a bit surprising to see a follow-up on the Vu this soon, the device looks alright on paper, and offers a few key spec improvements over its older counterpart. </p>
<p> Do you like phones that look like they've been through a taffy puller? Then the LG Intuition (aka Optimus Vu) may be the phablet for you. The Intuition for Verizon was announced last week, and is available officially starting today, though Wirefly has (as usual) managed to offer it at a slightly more reasonable price: just $150 on contract (new agreement or upgrade). That's $50 less than Verizon is selling it for, so there's no denying it's a deal. </p>
<p> There is denying, though, that you might actually, you know, want this phone. I suppose the one thing you could say about the Intution is that it's definitely a, uh, conversation starter. </p>
<p> After an exclusive stint in South Korea and Japan, LG's Optimus Vu is about to take various other parts of the world by storm. Select countries in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America will be seeing the Vu hit store shelves in September, and I imagine it's going to be pretty hard to miss. It's big. That's the joke. </p>
<p> LG's press release says the Vu "blurs the line" between phones and tablets for a "truly unique experience." I'll certainly buy that. Having used it in early prototype form myself back at MWC, I was baffled at how LG could go about justifying a smartphone like this, and I don't mean one with a 5" screen, but one that has a 4:3 display aspect ratio to go with it. </p>
<p> We're not exactly sure why, but LG has developed a gigantic new device called the Optimus Vu. And while the growing market for "mega-phones" seems to be getting more and more crowded every day, we have to say, LG's takes the cake for ridiculousness. The Vu's 5-inch display may not be absurdly large, but it is absurdly shaped. A 4:3 1024x768 (think CRT, Windows 98, etc.) display on the device makes it ridiculously wide, and also very oddly proportioned. I tend to think this is yet another device that will end up with 3rd-party app compatibility issues due to its unique resolution - something Kyocera Echo owners can probably... </p>
<p> MWC is still a few days away, and we're already starting to get some pretty great information on the devices that will shape the mobile electronics world in 2012. </p>
<p> Adding to the list of pre-MWC news items, the Italian blog Telefonino.net has posted a series of videos and photos, showcasing LG's complete Android lineup for 2012, from the LG Optimus 4X HD (which we mentioned yesterday) to the Optimus 3D MAX, to the Optimus LTE. Overall it's looking like LG is ready to introduce a bevy of impressively-spec'd handsets next week. It's worth mentioning ahead of time that the videos below are in Italian, but the hands-on demonstrations are worth watching anyway. </p>

<p> vysor </p>
<p> Earlier this month, Google announced they were killing off Chrome apps for Mac, Windows, and Linux. While it makes logical sense to remove a feature that almost no Chrome users actually used, there are still hundreds of excellent Chrome apps affected by the decision. Google recommends that developers move their applications to Electron (another way to run web apps on the desktop), but doing that would require rewriting every component using Chrome's APIs to the Electron equivalents. </p>
<p> Koush, developer of the Chrome app Vysor (among other projects), has made porting Chrome apps to Electron incredibly easy. With his tool, aptly named Electron Chrome, developers can compile their existing Chrome apps into Electron applications in seconds. </p>
<p> Koushik Dutta, a.k.a Koush, is one of Android's most popular developers. From the custom recovery ClockworkMod to ROM Manager, to Allcast, to Vysor, his apps are downloaded almost religiously amongst power users, developers, and tinkerers. In the last few hours, he's made a new app available in beta, named Inkwire. </p>
<p> Based on Koush's previous app, Vysor, which mirrors your Android device's screen on a computer, Inkwire goes one step further and shares the screen to another Android device, letting someone else help with a problem or issue, which could be especially useful for tech support workers or, as Koush says, independent app developers. </p>
<p> Vysor is a useful app for developers, designers, or just people who are curious about Android and want to see cool stuff on their computer. The app mirrors an Android device's screen on a computer, which uses a Chrome app with ADB to provide the interface between the phone or tablet and the computer. It should see many more downloads now, with Koush having uploaded his app to the Play Store. </p>
<p> Vysor can also be installed via ADB, using the aforementioned Chrome app. The Android app on its own does nothing; it will simply prompt you to get the app from the Chrome Web Store. However, </p>
<p> Koush has really kicked Vysor development into high gear after MPEG-LA came calling to demand its pound of flesh, and that's good for anyone who needs to manage a mess of test devices. Vysor now has a Share All feature, which makes it a snap to set up a device farm for testing. Yes, this is part of the paid version of the app, but it's cheaper than enterprise plans at a cloud testing service. </p>
<p> Koush had to take his device mirroring tool Vysor off the Chrome store last week after H.264 owner MPEG-LA came calling with a big bill. It seems the H.264 decoder in Vysor entitled MPEG-LA to royalties on Koush's free app. Well, after a weekend of coding, Vysor is back with a new decoder and a subscription option. </p>
<p> If you go looking for Koush's Vysor today, you won't be able to find it. Koush has announced that he had to pull the screen sharing app because of codec licensing. Despite being more or less ubiquitous, the H.264 codec isn't a free standard. Koush was contacted by MPEG-LA and told he'd need to license the decoder in Vysor for $0.20 per user. Koush opted to pull the tool from the Chrome web store instead, but he's on the hook for previous downloads. </p>
<p> Koush's Vysor is pretty cool: a way to see your Android screen on a computer, using a Chrome extension. This is great for using an Android app on your desktop PC, or for developers debugging apps. Previously, Vysor's 'Share' feature has worked between two people who have both had Vysor installed. Now, however, you can share with anyone, even if they do not have Vysor. </p>
<p> Simply press share on Vysor's control panel, and the link will be automatically copied to the computer's clipboard. All that's needed then is that link to be pasted to the intended recipient, who can then view the phone or tablet in Chrome or Firefox. </p>

<p> During times when a lot of people are requesting rides, Uber prices go up. It makes sense: higher fares incentivize drivers to be available to give rides during high-traffic times, which keeps customers happy.

<p> These tricks are quite useful, but it surprises me how relatively unpublished and unknown they are. </p>
<p> What's This All About? </p>
<p> I'm sure you can think of a situation where having some sort of a pause in a phone number could save quite a bit of time, as you could program the whole sequence once and never enter it manually again. </p>
<p> For example, I have a calling card which asks me a whole bunch of information, like the language I want the menu in, my account and pin, and the phone number I want to dial. </p>

<p> wallet </p>
<p> Google decided some time ago that the power button on Android phones could be useful for quick access to commonly-used features. An iOS-style wallet was added to the Pixel in March so you can switch between payment cards or bring up travel passes and loyalty cards when you need them, and next on the list is smart home controls. Evidence of this arrived with Android 11's developer previews, but freshly leaked documentation now shows us what the final product is going to look like. </p>
<p> Google Pay's new power menu quick access interface has been in the making for a long time and finally became official as part of the March Pixel feature drop. Thus, we've been using the quick wallet for a few weeks already, but we've only recently been pointed to another interesting new UI hiding behind the rightmost "View all" entry. When you enter Google Pay that way, you're greeted by a bottom-bar-less design that shows you both your payment methods and your loyalty cards in a one-page layout. </p>
<p> As we predicted last week, Google's latest quarterly Feature Drop is rolling out for Pixel phones today. Unlike the regular monthly security releases, this update includes a ton of new features, including a new play/pause gesture for Pixel 4's Motion Sense, a wider rollout of car crash detection, dark theme scheduling, Live Caption for the Pixel 2, a new power button wallet, live Duo AR effects, a pile of new emoji, and a whole lot more. </p>
<p> In what seems to be a theme today, Opera has revealed it's launching a private beta for a crypto-integrated version of its browser. This new beta adds a built-in wallet for cryptocurrencies as well as support for Ethereum-based decentralized applications (Dapps, for those in the know). </p>
<p> Samsung Pay and Android Pay/Google Pay have been around for years at this point, but there are plenty of other mobile payment solutions. LG Pay has existed in South Korea for a while, and now Huawei's payment app has been uploaded to the Play Store. </p>
<p> If you were around for yesterday's activities, you've already seen that Android Pay has been switched over to the new Google Pay branding, along with some upgrades to both the look and function. As part of the announcement, we were told that the Google Wallet app would be undergoing a short term rebranding of its own, taking on the name Google Pay Send. That version is now here, and unsurprisingly, it has been given some minor visual touch-ups. But not only that, it actually also got the reminders feature that was recently spotted in a teardown. </p>
<p> It's time for a new version of Android Messages. The latest update takes a slightly larger than average jump from v2.5 to v2.7, but no obvious changes to the UI are really popping out. However, the apk did get much smaller with this release, and there are some things visible through the lens of a teardown. We'll keep watching for other changes, but let us know if you see anything. </p>
<p> The Google Wallet app hasn't seen a lot of activity in a while, but an update began rolling out late yesterday that shows that there's still quite a bit happening to the app. Version 21 brings a number of visual enhancements that make the app look a bit cleaner and not quite as formal. Under the covers, a teardown also shows that the Wallet developers are about to launch multi-person money requests for those times when everybody splits the cost, a new reminders system to keep you from forgetting to take care of business, and confirms Android Messages integration is coming soon. </p>
<p> While Android Pay may have stolen the thunder in terms of Google's various methods of moving money from one party to another, Wallet is still up and running for those times when you've just got to move a few bucks between friends. The latest update looks basically identical to the last few versions, but a teardown of the app shows there are going to be a few changes to the security model that should reduce a little bit of friction and make the app much more convenient than it was in the past. </p>
<p> Android Pay is spreading. If you manage your finances with a big bank, chances are you can make payments by tapping your phone against a payment terminal -- yes, even if you use Chase. If you do your banking with a smaller institution, you may have to cross your fingers. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/08/30 9:05pm PDTon Aug 30, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/19 10:05am PDTon Sep 19, 2020. </p>
<p> LineageOS is the most popular custom ROM for Android devices, bringing new OS versions to phones and tablets that have long since been unsupported. The Pixel lineup has mostly been ignored by the project, outside of the original models, but now nearly every Google-made phone is receiving official builds of LineageOS. </p>
<p> A few things are known about the two upcoming successors to the Google Pixel and Pixel XL - we know that taimen is the largest of Google's 2017 devices, that muskie was shelved in favor of taimen and that taimen is being made by LG. However, we hadn't heard anything about specifications until now. Our friends over at XDA spoke with a source who has spent time with "at least one of these phones," and believe this information to be valid given the source's track record. </p>
<p> Based on information from three separate sources, we are now confident that Google has shelved plans to release one of its upcoming Pixel phones. The device, codenamed 'muskie,' was intended to succeed the Pixel XL. While we know very little about muskie, and now likely will never learn much else, we are confident that this phone was supposed to be the second-generation Pixel XL. </p>
<p> We rate this information 9 out of 10 on our rumor confidence scale. We have corroborated this story with several sources we deem reliable. The good news? That doesn't mean there won't be a new Pixel XL - just that it's not going to be muskie. </p>
<p> Around two weeks ago, we told you what the codenames of Google's next-generation Pixel phones are (it's muskie and walleye, if you've forgotten). After we wrote that post, a Googler commenting on the commit where walleye first appeared actually linked to our story and gave a light ribbing to the author for using unreleased device codenames in the public gerrit, which we found amusing. </p>
<p> At some point after that, though, the reference to walleye as well as the comment linking to our story were removed. If you go to the commit now, walleye is nowhere to be seen. Which, I guess that makes sense? </p>
<p> Corroborating information provided to us by a source, we can share the first public sighting of Google's next-generation Pixel phones: in the Android Open Source Project gerrit (and yes, that means it's running Android). We've only seen one of the phones - walleye - which we believe will be the smaller of Google's new Pixel devices. Muskie, the larger of the two, has not yet appeared. (For reference, last year, we only ever saw Marlin in the AOSP gerrit - there's no guarantee Muskie will ever show up there.) </p>
<p> At this point, we don't have any more information about the devices that we are yet confident enough to share. </p>

<p> Wall Street Journal </p>
<p> Amazon is reportedly pushing back its two-day Prime Day sales event from its usual July spot to September, according to a report out of The Wall Street Journal. A previous report from Reuters back in April claimed the sale may be delayed until August, but it appears Amazon is giving itself an extra month to stock up. </p>
<p> According to a report published today by the Wall Street Journal, Samsung's next Galaxy S phone may have up to four total variants, one of which will sport a chunky 6.7"screen, six cameras, and 5G connectivity when it lands sometime next spring. In addition to that tech-toting titan, three smaller models are allegedly planned for an earlier release in February. </p>
<p> The Wall Street Journal has reported that Nintendo and DeNA are teaming up once again in order to bring us Android gamers a new title in The Legend of Zelda series. Honestly, this isn't much of a surprise seeing how well their latest Zelda game has been selling for the Wii U and Switch. </p>
<p> The Wall Street Journal has just released a new Android app called WSJ AR. It is an augmented reality app that allows you to navigate a visualization of the US stock market via your Tango phone. In addition to overall market representations, you can zoom in to look at individual stock details, view headlines related to the selected stock, and save your favorites. </p>
<p> Quite a lot of us have done away with the landline telephones that used to be a staple of homes in the developed world. A 2013 survey concluded that over 40% of US households had ditched their standard landlines phones, driven by younger users relying exclusively on their cell phones. But according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, both Google and Amazon are looking to revive the landline (well, VOIP line anyway) as a bonus feature in their voice-controlled Wi-Fi speakers, the Google Home and Amazon Echo/Tap/Echo Dot. </p>
<p> Google, for all its skill in the realms of mobile search, advertising, email, and even operating systems, has never been particularly good at the social thing. Even now, I suspect, someone at Google is fuming at the notion that the company "isn't very good" at messaging or social networks and pointing animatedly at the tens of millions of Google+ and Hangouts users. The problem is and has always been that for whatever success Google has had in social and messaging platforms, it is constantly undercut by the actions of Google itself that say otherwise. There is near-yearly reworking, redesigning, or branching off of these products in ways that very strongly suggest they aren't getting the results Google's Alphabet overlords consider acceptable. </p>
<p> Amazon's Fire Phone, the logical smartphone extension of its Kindle Fire tablet series, is a dud. A combination of lackluster reviews, carrier semi-exclusivity, and most of all being tied into Amazon's app and service environment have made it more or less a total failure. The company never publishes hard data for its hardware sales, but casual observation and constant discounts (sometimes more than $500 off of the original $650 off-contract price) imply that the product has been a wash. </p>
<p> The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Amazon isn't eager to continue in the phone market. According to the paper, "dozens" of engineers in the Lab126 hardware team have been laid off. </p>
<p> At the first few major tech conferences of the year, CES in Las Vegas, Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, and the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, the current trend of virtual reality is inescapable. Such disparate players as Facebook, Samsung, and Razer are all throwing their weight behind various virtual reality headsets, and software developers are scrambling to meet the demand for apps, games, and videos. According to this report by the Wall Street Journal, Google isn't content to dip its toe into VR with the mostly experimental Cardboard platform. </p>
<p> The paper cites "two people familiar with the project" who say that the company is working on another branch of Android specifically for virtual reality hardware and software. </p>
<p> Though the hardware was mildly refreshed back in June, Google Glass has been running on much the same internals for the better part of two years. With the rise of Android Wear, at least some of us were wondering whether Google still intended to bring its head-mounted wearable system to retail at all. According to the latest report from the Wall Street Journal, Google is indeed planning at least one more version of Glass, this time running on an Intel chipset. The new hardware will reportedly be released next year. </p>
<p> The original and current Glass models use Texas Instruments processors. </p>
<p> Samsung seems to have a big target on its back that is particularly attractive to lawyers. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, a media company focusing on photography and management is suing Samsung over its use of the "Milk" trademark for its proprietary music service. The New York- and Los Angeles-based agency alleges that Samsung knowingly and willingly violated its trademark when designing the new service. </p>
<p> Milk Studios isn't particularly well-known for everyday consumers, but it's more notable than you might think. While Milk Studios started with photography services in the 90s, it has expanded into a range of niche business-to-business media sectors, including online services, equipment rental, brick-and-mortar galleries, talent management and representation, and full production of websites, commercials, and more pertinently, music and music videos. </p>

<p> So you have a miniature remote controlled car that you can race around with your Android phone. Big whoop. This guy built a quasi-flying capsule that he controls with his smartphone. He wins. Over and over again. But let's back up to the beginning of the story. </p>
<p> Jono Williams is a plastics engineer and graphic designer who lives in New Zealand. He wanted to build a tree house, but he struggled for months with the limitations. See, trees grow with time, they are prone to the elements and could damage whatever structure you build between or on them, and they tend to obscure the view at least from several angles. </p>
<p> Our demographics adviser tells us that there might just be five people on earth who are both regular Android Police readers and Model S owners. But if a quick scan of the office is a valid measure of interest, there's at least a few of you who are excited by the prospect of an official Tesla app, even if a longing glance is as close as we'll ever get to driving one. For you lucky devils who have an all-electric sedan sitting in your four-car garage, take a quick stroll over to the Play Store to get your companion app on. </p>
<p> WebOS may catch a lot of flack because it never really took off but it does, in fact, have some really awesome features. One feature was the card view multitasking, which has already found its way onto Android. Another cool thing it did was that wacky swipe-up-from-the-bottom launcher gesture. Well, folks, guess what there's an app for now. It's called Wave Launcher - and it's great. </p>
<p> Wave Launcher's beauty is in its simplicity, just like its WebOS predecessor. You simply touch the bottom edge of your screen and swipe up. As you swipe up, so does a bar of five or more applications for you to select. </p>

<p> Earlier this month Studio Wildcard announced that its hit dinosaur action-adventure game ARK: Survival Evolved would release for Android on June 14th, and as long as my eyes aren't deceiving me, it would appear that the studio has stayed true to its word. You can grab the dino adventure off of the Play Store right now. Just make sure you have a beefy device, as you will need at least 3 GB of RAM and 2.11 GB of free storage. </p>
<p> Studio Wildcard's hit dinosaur-themed survival game ARK: Survival Evolved is coming to Android this spring, and you can pre-register for the release right now on playark.com. Interestingly this upcoming on-the-go version of ARK is being designed and developed by War Drum Studios as a free-to-play release. It's supposed to closely mirror the online survival experience contained in the PC and console versions, though there will be some necessary changes with the shift in monetization, which leaves me apprehensive as to how the finished product will turn out. </p>
<p> Update: It turns out someone jumped the gun on this one, and the game isn't actually available just yet - which is why so many users are getting the "validation error." Rockstar is aware of the issue and posted a statement on their official blog: </p>
<p> We’re aware that some users have attempted to download Vice City: 10th Anniversary Edition from the Google Play Store and have experienced validation errors. Just to be clear: the game is not available for Android devices just yet, and if you’re seeing it listed on the Store then this is an error, and you shouldn’t attempt to download it. </p>

<p> Spotify's launch in India has been a long time coming. It's nearly inconceivable that the music streaming giant hasn't yet put its foot in one of the world's largest markets and tried to grab millions of subscribers. But after years of waiting, we're almost there: following recent rumors of Spotify's India launch, the app is now available on the Play Store in India and signing up with an account is possible, even if buying a Premium subscription isn't working smoothly yet. </p>
<p> On the eve of I/O, Google managed to finalize deals with Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment to bring a music subscription service to both YouTube and Google Play, according to a report by The Verge that is now being corroborated by The Wall Street Journal. If everything goes smoothly, a preview or launch of the new service tomorrow isn't out of the question. The Journal similarly says the streaming solution could launch "as soon as this week." That would give Google a substantial leg up over Apple, which is still in the process of negotiating contracts for its own music streaming solution. </p>

<p> The biggest splash you'll see about power management on the OnePlus 8 Pro is that you'll be able to use its complementary Warp Charge 30 Wireless charger to pump a whopping 30 watts without the need for a cable. That said, you'll still be able to charge the 8 Pro wirelessly with pretty much any Qi charging pad and have the pad charge other phones via Qi, too. </p>
<p> Leaks have already indicated that the OnePlus 8 Pro will support wireless charging (though the smaller 8 probably won't), and today the company has revealed some of the specs behind its wireless charging solution. The new Warp Charge 30 Wireless spits 30W — that's the same power as OnePlus' wired Warp Charge. If it works as advertised and doesn't get too toasty, that means similar charging speeds whether you prefer a cable or a stand. </p>

<p> warranty </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/16 9:29am PDTon Apr 16, 2020 and last updated 2020/04/22 1:28am PDTon Apr 22, 2020. </p>
<p> In a fragile time when the world is under a pandemic and the least common denominator in corporate marketing campaigns is "we're all in this together," there are still ways where companies can compete and advertise their efforts. HMD Global, for example, has made a goodwill gesture towards its customers by extending the warranties for some Nokia phones. </p>
<p> Like many other countries, all of India is currently under lockdown. There are only a few exceptions from this rule, and going to a Samsung shop to get your device fixed is not among the legit reasons to leave your home —in fact, all Samsung stores are currently closed. The Korean company recognizes this situation and offers extended service for devices that would've seen the end of their warranty during the lockdown period. It's also possible to pick up a pre-booked Galaxy S20 at a later time. </p>
<p> Most companies have been putting out statements to assure customers during the coronavirus pandemic, and OnePlus is no exception. Following up on a post published last week, the company has just announced that it is extending warranty coverage and return periods to make things a little easier for customers. It's also working on a "back-up device program" that lets you apply for a loaner device while your own undergoes repairs. </p>
<p> Moshi aims to produce premium, long-lasting accessories for mobile devices, and most of the time, the company succeeds — many of its products we've reviewed over the years have proved to be well worth their money. During CES 2020, the manufacturer has made clear that it believes in the quality of its electronics by introducing a free 10-year global warranty. </p>
<p> Here in the US, Google has had its own mail-in repair center set up for Pixel phones for around eight months. In the rest of the world, though, Google offers nothing of the sort, instead pointing customers to recommended walk-in and mail-in service centers via a support page. These support pages have just been updated, indicating that official mail-in services will soon be offered in a number of European countries. </p>
<p> The Federal Trade Commission released a statement today saying it's sent warning letters to several major companies in the US reminding them that it's illegal to stipulate warranty coverage is dependent on using prescribed parts and service providers for repairs. In addition to manufacturers of "cellular devices," warnings were also sent to companies that sell cars and video game hardware. </p>
<p> By now, all of you are familiar with the issues people are having with the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, namely with the display. Google's VP of Product Management, Mario Queiroz, has just issued a statement saying that all Pixel 2 phones will be upgraded to two-year warranties for added peace of mind. </p>
<p> The Nexus 6P is one of those phones that had high initial quality, but it hasn't withstood the test of time very well. This phone has been plagued by battery issues that cause it to randomly shut off. Those who bought their phones from the Google Store have reported success not only with getting the phone replaced, but replaced with a Pixel XL. </p>
<p> Let's face it - LG phones have had problems with long-term use in the past. Many former phones from the company experienced the famous bootloop issue, which plagued the G4, Nexus 5X, G5, V10, and others. This was especially a problem for phones outside the warranty period. LG wants you to know that it's confident in the G6's longevity, and as a result, the company has extended the phones' warranty period to two years. </p>
<p> Buying a used phone is something of a crapshoot. Customers can do all the research they like or pore over photos with a magnifying glass, but eventually they just have to trust that someone else hasn't dumped a lemon of a device onto the next sucker. Swappa, a marketplace for gadget buyers and sellers that specializes in Android hardware, is trying to take some of the uncertainty out of that process. Starting today the company is offering device protection plans for phones, with laptops and tablets coming soon. </p>

<p> There's no denying that Apple makes the best all-around smartwatches, especially if you care about fitness, so Android-compatible watches continue to battle for second place. The most recent entry from the Wear OS camp is the fifth-gen Fossil Q, and while that watch is a decent step up from every other device with the same software, it still hasn't addressed some of the platform's core problems — poor fitness tracking, degrading app library, and so on. </p>
<p> Samsung's new watch is a follow-up to the Galaxy Watch Active, which was (by most accounts) the best overall smartwatch for Android devices. </p>
<p> Samsung just posted a teaser video appearing to (barely) show off both the previously-leaked Tab S6 and Watch Active 2 — assuming those end up being the final names. If super-close panning shots of edges and extreme angles aren't quite your thing, there is one pertinent bit of actual information: A pair of dates stating when the devices will be "digitally unveiled." </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/watches/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485131" filename="watches">
<p> Back in March, Chinese manufacturer Oppo announced its first smartwatch, sporting a design similar to the one of an Apple Watch. The device, called the Oppo Watch, was exclusively meant to be sold on the Chinese Market and ran an in-house Android-based OS. However, a new promotional video seems to point the company is about to release a refreshed version of the product that will ship with Wear OS. </p>
<p> Mobvoi is one of the few companies still taking the future of Wear OS seriously and releasing new hardware. But today Mobvoi has a deal reaching into the past. The company's 2018 flagship smartwatch, the TicWatch Pro, is available on Amazon for just $139.99, a savings of $60 off recent prices. </p>
<p> Fossil makes some of the most handsome Wear OS devices around, with simple, relatively traditional styling. From right now through the end of the week, many of their latest watches are on sale for $199. Depending on which you're interested in, that's a savings of up to $76. </p>
<p> Casio's Pro Trek line of smart watches started in 2016 with the WSD-F10, a bulky, expensive Android Wear device with aesthetics and a feature set slanted at the outdoorsy market. The company followed up in 2017 with the WSD-F20, a refinement on the concept. Now, Casio is back at it with the WSD-F30, which is less chunky, but still rugged (and expensive). </p>
<p> Documentation concerning a new Wear OS watch manufactured by LG has appeared on the Federal Communication Commission's website. The listing doesn't reveal a whole lot, but the watch is described as a "portable wrist device" with a model number of LM-W315. It's possible the filing is for LG's rumored "hybrid" watch that's said to feature both physical hands and an LCD display. </p>
<p> I've been here at Android Police for over a year, now, fighting my way up the ranks and RSS feeds. So far I've succeeded, and having the opportunity to spend my days writing about technology has been incredible. As a result of that, I've accrued a ton of hardware and software, much of which has become an integral part of my workflow and life. </p>
<p> So here's a peek at all the stuff, personal and professional, that lets me do me. </p>
<p> Android Wear is entering a potentially critical time. Wear 2.0 hasn't been received nearly as well as might have been expected, with many observers understandably worrying for its future. Watches were conspicuously absent from Google's big hardware event last week, and the Google Store site refresh has removed all non-Google products, including LG's recently released Android Wear watches. </p>
<p> Wear fans could use some more good news to add to the recent announcement of the Oreo beta program for the LG Watch Sport, and it looks as though we have exactly that. Googler Hoi Lam took to Google+ yesterday to share some new information about future updates to Android Wear 2.0. </p>
<p> About a year and a half ago, Corning first announced Project Phire, a hybrid between Gorilla Glass and sapphire. The project aimed to bring Gorilla Glass's drop protection and sapphire's extreme scratch resistance together to create an extremely durable display glass. Now, the company has introduced Gorilla Glass SR+, the result of Project Phire's research, for wearable use. </p>
<p> The first few Android Wear watches from mid-2014 were watches in name only. They were really more like tiny screens strapped to your wrist that told the time. The design of Android Wear devices has evolved significantly since then, and now there are some that look like honest-to-goodness watches. The second gen Moto 360 and Huawei Watch are the most watch-like so far, but they aren't cheap. Let's see how they compare so you can (maybe) pick up the right one for you. </p>
<p> According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is working on a few things. They are, according to the world's most infamous tipster "People Familiar With The Matter," working on an Android-powered video game console. And a smart watch. And a new Nexus Q. And the possibility of Android-powered appliances (like refrigerators). And Laptops. And, oh yeah, low-cost phones for developing markets. </p>
<p> Typically we avoid reporting on too-good-to-be-true rumors, but today's alleged revelation is a real whopper. Since it comes from the Wall Street Journal – which often comes through on rumors – it might just be worth keeping an eye on. </p>

<p> If you pay for cable, you probably pay for ESPN. Disney's sports empire is practically inescapable, especially if you watch college sports, and it's essentially impossible to pay for conventional television without getting ESPN thrown into the package, whether you want it or not. So if you're paying for it, you might as well get it on your phone too, right? ESPN's live streaming service WatchESPN is now available within the primary ESPN app itself. Previously WatchESPN was a separate Android app. </p>
<p> Update: Anime provider Crunchyroll has gained Chromecast support as well. </p>
<p> The 2014 FIFA World Cup will start next week, making this just the right time for WatchESPN and MLS Matchday to roll out their new ability to stream matches straight to Chromecast. You still need a cable subscription to enjoy any of the content, but the feature prevents having to reach for the TV remote and navigate that troublesome guide for the correct channel. Just fire up that app and poke that touchscreen the way we Android fans just can't get enough of. </p>
<p> Those of you who are lucky enough to attend the game in person can rest assured knowing that when you get back, Google+ Photos is now ready to let you toss up those photos and recordings you took up onto the big screen as well. </p>
<p> Are you an AT&T U-verse customer who's been chomping at the bit to get your hands (or eyes, rather) on some sports action while on-the-go? Today's your lucky day – AT&T and ESPN just announced support for the WatchESPN app for qualifying U-verse customers. And by "qualifying" they mean "customers who actually have ESPN as part of their package." So, that should be pretty much everyone, right? </p>
<p> Either way, the app is free so you can hit up the Play Store to grab it, enter your U-verse login credentials, and away you go. Just in time for the NBA Playoffs, too. </p>
<p> If you love ESPN but are angry because Comcast won't let you watch it on your phone through the WatchESPN app, your luck just changed. The most recent update to the app fixes that exact issue: it now allows Comcast customers who get ESPN as part of the TV package watch the channel on their smartphone or tablet. </p>
<p> That's really the only major difference with this update - aside from the always-included bug fixes, of course. If you already have the app installed, you can pull the update now. But, if you're a Comcast customer who uninstalled it in a fit of rage after realizing that it was basically worthless to you, hit the widget below. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/watch-faces/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17483476" filename="watch-faces">
<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Wear OS faces that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous three months or so. Typically AP includes apps in our Wear OS roundups, but sadly I don't have any to share this time around. This means today's roundup will specifically highlight a bunch of new watch faces, and since I have so many to share I've split the list into two separate pages for easier consumption. You can expect to find the flashier faces on the first page, and the more traditional designs are located on the second page. </p>
<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Wear OS apps and faces that went live on the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous six months or so. Since our last collection, Google has changed the branding from Android Wear to Wear OS, and there are finally devices in the market that contain the new Snapdragon 3100 chip, which allows for more features, such as a visible second hand when the ambient mode is on. While I'm sure the progress of Wear OS isn't moving as fast as enthusiasts would like, there's no arguing the platform isn't dead yet. </p>
<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Wear OS apps and faces that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous seven months or so. It's been a slow process cataloging each Wear release since February, but I think we finally have enough to push out another roundup of the best Wear OS has to offer. </p>
<p> A day or two of uptime for a smartwatch is accepted as the norm these days — a sad state of affairs, indeed. So when a nifty feature is introduced, excitement is immediately doused with the reality that it almost certainly means conceding some already-scanty battery life. Facer recently announced watch face games for Wear OS and Tizen smartwatches, and they seem like a clever take on uber-casual gaming worth your while if you're fine keeping that charger nearby. </p>
<p> Don’t you wish your favorite Wear OS watch face could do more? Thanks to a huge new Facer update, it can! </p>
<p> Facer 4.6.0 adds support for interactive watch faces for the first time, giving users the ability to launch apps, play mini-games, trigger fun animations, and lots more right from their wrist. </p>
<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Android Wear faces that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous 3 months or so. </p>
<p> With Christmas right around the corner, I thought it would be prudent to put together a list of apps, games, live wallpapers, and watch faces that are appropriately holiday-themed. There are a total of 15 Play Store listings within this list, and each one has been hand-picked. So if you are looking for some great Android-specific apps with a Christmas theme, you have clicked on the right listicle. </p>
<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Android Wear apps and faces that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous month or so. </p>

<p> It's getting harder to do something new with Android Wear watch faces, but that doesn't mean you can't improve on what's already been done. Case in point: the new Task Master watch face shows calendar appointments on your wearable, but it does so better than other watch faces. It's even usable if you've got a lot of calendar appointments to track. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/watch-history/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485143" filename="watch-history">
<p> watch history </p>
<p> Other than letting you watch linear TV anywhere you go, YouTube TV also allows you to save as many episodes and shows to a virtual DVR as you like. This likely helped grow many people's libraries to unsurmountable sizes, which makes it harder to keep track of what you've watched and what you haven't. Google seems to recognize this, as the company is starting to roll out a "mark as watched" option so you can manually sort out episodes you've already finished, in case the platform hasn't caught that you did. </p>
<p> It has been about six weeks since the last YouTube Gaming update rolled out, and it's clear the developers have been keeping pretty busy on making changes. The latest update has quite a few improvements to be found throughout the app, not to mention at least one feature that might be considered pretty huge. Topping the list is a new live comment stream that overlays gameplay videos so you can see the action and watch the commentary at the same time. A few features have been moved to more convenient places and a video history is now available. Finally, there's a new easter egg, and it's pretty awesome. </p>
<p> Version 1.50 of YouTube Kids started rolling out early Thursday morning. This update brings a really great new feature, and parents are going to love it. It's now possible to pause the watch history of YouTube Kids, and it doesn't affect the rest of your YouTube apps. A teardown also shows that parents will soon enjoy the benefits of YouTube Red, as well. As usual, if the update hasn't hit your account yet, jump to the bottom of the post to find a download link. </p>
<p> A brand new update to YouTube just started rolling out, and it gives users just a little more control over their privacy. The latest version adds a new option called "Pause watch history" so users can prevent new videos from joining their previously watched list. This joins an existing option to pause search history and two commands to clear the history from either list. Now we've got an easy way to keep prying eyes from discovering that we watch cartoons during lunch breaks. </p>

<p> Watchon </p>
<p> WatchON is a Samsung-exclusive offering that serves as a universal remote and TV guide all bundled up into one place. When the Galaxy S5 launched earlier this year, the Korean conglomerate released an updated version of WatchON for its new flagship device and introduced the app to the Play Store for the first time. Yet despite this Google Play presence, the updated version remained exclusively available to the Galaxy S5, and Samsung's other handsets were left with an older version of the pre-installed software. </p>
<p> Samsung hasn't added as many of its stock apps to the Play Store as Motorola, Sony, or HTC have, but it still uses Google's platform to distribute a few things. The new version of WatchON has been added to the Play Store for the Galaxy S5 (might also be available on the Note 3 Neo in some regions). This version of WatchON has a different look than older versions, and fits in nicely with Samsung's new design aesthetic. </p>
<p> Verizon has shared details for an upcoming Galaxy Note 10.1 software update that will bring Samsung's WatchON app to the device. The service, which comes pre-installed on many Samsung devices, turns your phone or tablet into an interactive TV guide. It comes with a universal remote for channel surfing, simplifies searching for shows, and enables you to watch some content across multiple devices. This functionality comes bundled as a part of software version JZ054K.I925VRAMK1. </p>
<p> Like Google has done with its own first-party apps, Samsung has placed its WatchON app on the Play Store for easy updates. Of course, it's still limited to Samsung hardware - this version has been updated for the Galaxy S4 (and the S4 Active, and likely a few more variants as they become available). Meanwhile the tablet app is being expanded to include support for the Galaxy Note 10.1 and both 7" and 10" versions of the Galaxy Tab 2. </p>

<p> Watch Party </p>
<p> It's slightly more difficult to get together with friends to watch movies and TV shows, given there's a pandemic and all, which has led to a rush for group playback tools. Browser extensions for syncing playback across multiple people have seen a rise in popularity, and services like Prime Video and Plex have added native group play. Disney announced today that it is adding the functionality to Disney+, so you can host watch-alongs across all platforms. </p>
<p> With recent world events keeping us at home, it can be hard to stay connected with friends and family. Social events like going to movie theaters might not be an option right now, but that doesn't mean you can't watch a movie along with your favorite group of amateur film critics. Amazon is introducing a feature called Watch Party that lets groups of up to 100 Prime members view content together simultaneously. </p>

<p> Android Wear isn't an especially popular platform these days, but plenty of people still use it - enough for Google to have released two new smartwatches, the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style, earlier this year. But just eight months after their release, the Android Wear page has disappeared from the Google Store's home page. And more interestingly, both the Watch Sport and Watch Style are now marked as "no longer available." </p>
<p> At launch, the LG Watch Sport cost a whopping $349, putting it on the higher end of the Android Wear market. In fairness, it did pack a lot of features, but $350 is still a hard pill to swallow for a smartwatch. But now, you can get a brand new Watch Sport for just $239.99 - a substantial $110 off the original MSRP - at Daily Steals. </p>
<p> When the LG Watch Sport was announced, Verizon was on the list of carriers that would sell it. However, it's been three months since then, and Verizon still hasn't made it available for sale, with nothing being shipped to pre-orderers. It turns out that the chunky device has been completely canceled for Big Red. </p>
<p> While not exactly the best-kept secret, Google and LG's collaborative smartwatch effort was fully announced today with the detailing of the Watch Style and Watch Sport. Pretty much every rumor you've heard from us and others to date was on point here, so a lot of this is going to be rehash, but we'll go through the motions. </p>
<p> First, the details you'll want if you're a prospective buyer: Both watches go on sale on February 10th in the United States. Both will be on the Google Store, where you'll be able to get the Watch Style for $249 ($279 for rose gold), and the Watch Sport - including a Google Store exclusive blue version - for $349. </p>
<p> After revealing late last week that LG's Watch Style will come in at $249, today we can confirm via one of our trusted sources that its bigger, LTE-enabled brother will cost $100 more. The LG Watch Sport will have an MSRP of $349 here in the US, though it is unclear if color or band options could raise that price for certain configurations. </p>
<p> As a reminder, the Watch Sport brings a lot of features that the Watch Style will lack: LTE for true standalone functionality, NFC for Android Pay, GPS, a heart-rate monitor, a bigger, denser screen, and more buttons. </p>

<p> We're all trying to feel more connected online these days — the loneliness is strong. Sometimes the group chats and video calls aren't enough, and you wish you could just sit back and watch videos with your friends. Luckily for you, Facebook is continuing its trend of personal connection updates with the launch of Watch Together, a feature that will allow you to view videos simultaneously with a group. </p>
<p> There are third-party extensions like Scener that allow us to watch content from Netflix, HBO, and other services together while staying apart during these times of coronavirus-induced social distancing orders, but Plex is ready to up this with a native solution. It has announced a new Plex Labs experiment that allows you to watch shows, movies, and videos from your library together with others, perfectly synced up for everyone. </p>
<p> Hype for VR may have started to die down a bit, but software development applied to the various hardware platforms continues apace, and that includes YouTube VR. Yesterday it announced it would be coming to Samsung's Gear VR headsets this week, and it is also introducing a new way to share VR experiences called "Watch Together," which will allow YouTube VR users to watch and discuss content in a shared virtual space. A handful of new exclusive content will also be coming to the platform. </p>

<p> watch urbane 2 </p>
<p> The LG Watch Urbane 2 was exciting when it was announced, since it was the first Android Wear device capable of working as a stand-alone mobile gadget with a built-in LTE connection. Then it wasn't, because LG delayed the launch after an unspecified (but apparently quite serious) hardware defect. Now the launch is back on: AT&T announced its pre-order plans earlier this week, and now it's Verizon's turn. The carrier is taking pre-orders now, with watches shipping (and presumably ready at retail) on April 1st. No foolin'. </p>
<p> A lot of money, as it turns out. While the AT&T version of the Watch Urbane 2 is $360, or $200 with a two-year contract, the Verizon model is a whopping $499.99 outright. </p>
<p> Things did not go as planned for LG with the Watch Urbane 2nd Edition, which was originally supposed to come out late last year. A hardware defect caused the company to halt the release and bring the watch back to the drawing board. Now, it's ready to go again and AT&T will let you pre-order one right now. </p>
<p> Up until now, there have only been two gestures on Android Wear (both of which I use constantly): scroll up by flicking the wrist in, and scroll down by flicking the wrist out. I've found these to be quick and easy ways of interacting with Android Wear, especially when I'm busy with other things or my hands are full. Since these were introduced, I've often hoped for more gestures, especially for things like exiting apps or going to the next screen. </p>
<p> With Android Wear 1.4 (Marshmallow), Google must've realized how valuable gestures can be, because it brought three new ones to the table: select, go back, and exit to watch face. </p>
<p> So the LG Watch Urbane 2 LTE is available now from Verizon and AT&T, and we've had one in the house for a little over a day now. Since I've had some time to kind of run through it and see what it's all about, I figured this was as good a time as any to share some initial thoughts. So here we go. </p>
<p> First off, it's pretty thick. Like, a lot thicker than my current smartwatch — the Sony Smartwatch 3 — so I was a little worried about putting it on for the first time. You know what, though? That worry was really for nothing. </p>

<p> LG reached out to us moments ago with news that the company's upcoming smartwatch, the Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, has been canceled due to an unspecified hardware issue. There is no word at this time if the device will be released at a later date, but for now, LG is calling this a full-on cancellation of the launch. </p>
<p> We understand that you are currently reviewing our latest smartwatch; however, late in the quality assurance process for the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, our engineers were made aware of a hardware issue which affects the day-to-day functionality of the device. </p>
<p> Version 1.4 of the Android Wear app started rolling out late Friday. The theme of this update, at least for what's currently live, is a set of changes to the Settings screen. There are a couple of new options, but they come at the expense of the battery stats screen. A look under the hood also shows that a few other features are either live or in the works for the next Wear OS update. </p>
<p> It was rumored that LG would be launching a cellular-connected Android Wear watch soon, and well, here it is. The Watch Urbane Second (or 2nd) Edition is the first Android Wear device we've seen that uses a cellular connection instead of a Bluetooth connection to a smartphone or a local Wi-Fi network, much like Samsung's Gear S series or LG's own Watch Urbane LTE (neither of which ran Wear). Aside from the addition of a mobile connection, it's a round screen watch presumably using at least some of the same hardware as the older Urbane. </p>

<p> Ever since Google sold Motorola to Lenovo, the brand's strategy has been subject to change. In the past, there were only three model lines, but now, it's hard to discern the plethora of often all-too-similar phones released under the Moto name. There also hasn't been a proper flagship for a while, but Motorola is apparently looking to change that. OnLeaks and Pricebaba have teamed up to share renders and specifications of an alleged Motorola Edge+, and it could shape up to be the brand's new front runner. </p>
<p> How many ways can you build a rectangle? When it comes to smartphone displays, it can get quite excessive. Chinese manufacturer Oppo recently revealed its work on a panel with a highly-translucent portion containing a phone's front cameras. Now, the company is circulating images and video of what it calls a "waterfall display" — basically a curved edge screen, but with the curves on steroids. </p>

<p> waterproof speaker </p>
<p> The UE Boom 2 is one of the finest Bluetooth speakers you can buy. Great sound, long battery life, distinct styling, and a waterproof exterior make it stand out in the crowded group of competitors in the portable speaker arena. </p>
<p> It's also one of the pricier speakers on the market, normally selling for the premium of price of $200. With the support of a strong brand name and stellar reviews, the Boom 2 almost never dips below this price. </p>
<p> It happens to be on sale today. At least in a couple of color variations. The royal and baby blue 'Brainfreeze Edition' is currently priced at $166.42, and the obnoxiously bright pink and orange 'Tropical Edition' is even lower at $161.16. </p>
<p> Did you know that the bathroom is typically the most acoustically pleasing room in a house? The hard surfaces of tile, glass, and linoleum bounce sound wonderfully giving music added richness and depth. That's why we love to sing in the bathroom – it amplifies our voices and makes us sound better (fun fact, Weird Al Yankovic recorded his first single "My Bologna" in a bathroom). The only thing that makes singing in the shower even better is a little musical accompaniment from a water-resistant Bluetooth speaker, and today Amazon has one on sale. The TaoTronics water-resistant Bluetooth 3.0 shower speaker is just $10 after applying a $10 off coupon. </p>
<p> When asked which speaker company I think offers the biggest bang for the buck, the answer is pretty easy: it's either G-Project or Soundfreaq. Both are great companies, and each offers a lot of speaker for the money. They both target very different sets of users, however, so I don't really feel like they easily cross paths in the market. For example, Soundfreaq makes killer "around the house" speakers - they're not necessarily designed for ultimate portability, and they don't have a super robust look or feel to them. G-Project speakers, on the other hand, are built tough. They're made for outdoor use, to be thrown in a backpack, and to generally get beaten to death (not literally, of course). </p>

<p> wayward souls </p>
<p> Update: the developers released another quick update on September 19th, explicitly supporting the MOGA family of controllers. The NES30 mentioned below, a generic Bluetooth HID controller, is also working. Well done, Noodlecake and RocketCat! </p>
<p> -- </p>
<p> I've been playing the heck out of Noodlecake and RocketCat's Wayward Souls RPG-roguelike ever since it landed on Android. While the top-down action game does have some excellent touchscreen controls, there's just no substitute for a real gamepad. </p>
<p> The immensely difficult dungeon crawler Wayward Souls is currently up on Amazon for $1.99, one third of its usual price. That makes now a good time to pick up the game and walk away with a few dollars saved and a compelling title to boot. Not only that, buyers also get 60 Amazon Coins back, which amounts to 60 cents. For the math averse, that brings this title down to 140 coins for the people with virtual monies to spend. </p>
<p> Noodlecake has brought developer Rocketcat's Wayward Souls over to Android, enabling waves of new players to experience this challenging action adventure game. This title, which takes inspiration from the likes of Spelunky and Secret of Mana, pushes players out onto the floor of a randomly generated dungeon and wishes them the best, all while pounding them with horde after horde of enemies and challenging bosses. It's a fast experience that's easy to dive into and just as easy to get kicked back out of. </p>

<p> wear 3100 </p>
<p> With the Summit 2, Montblanc was the first company to release a smartwatch powered by Snapdragon's latest Wear 3100 chipset. The luxury brand just unveiled an updated timepiece, which now comes with built-in LTE, along with other improvements. </p>
<p> It isn't easy to find a Wear OS device that is feature rich, affordable, and small enough to evade classification as a planet these days, but Fossil's new Sport smartwatch is certainly enticing. It's not too big (41 or 43mm case sizes), features the latest in wearable processing (Snapdragon Wear 3100), and covers all the standard bases (5 ATM water resistance, NFC, heart rate sensor) for $255. But in case you're thinking that's still a little bit pricey for what's on offer — you're probably right. But you're also in luck, because there's 30 percent off site-wide on Fossil products for Black Friday in the US, available immediately. </p>
<p> Fossil has been one of the few companies keeping Wear OS afloat over the past several years as we waited and waited... and waited for a new Qualcomm wearable chip. Well, the Snapdragon Wear 3100 is out there, and now Fossil is launching its first smartwatch with one. The generic-sounding Fossil Sport Smartwatch is a colorful, feature-rich wearable, and it's out in just a few days. </p>
<p> When Qualcomm revealed its new Wear 3100 chipset — a long-awaited yet minimal update that put battery life ahead of performance — it also took the opportunity to show off one of the first partner devices. Now, that device is available for purchase. The Montblanc Summit 2 is a good representation of the type of Wear OS device Qualcomm is betting on going forward. It's a fashion smartwatch that begins at $995 and caters to the luxury jet set demographic. </p>
<p> It's been two and a half years since Qualcomm revealed its first dedicated wearable chipset, Wear 2100, and, in that time, there's been no major update. This has led to some doubt regarding the chipmaker's interest in the market — a crucial element for Wear OS' continued existence, considering Qualcomm powers 80 percent of Android smartwatches out there now. The San Diego chipset giant asserted its continued intention to dominate the Wear OS market today, however, with the reveal of Wear 3100 — and the subtext of the announcement has indications for the industry at large. </p>

<p> wear 5.1 feature spotlight </p>
<p> Setting a timer or alarm has been one of my favorite conveniences since I started using a Wear device regularly 6 months ago. Granted, they aren't must-haves in my life, but they do come in handy occasionally, and I find myself using them on Wear more often than I would on my phone. </p>
<p> Google is probably well-aware these features get a comparatively high amount of use on Wear, so they've completely revamped the UIs and even added some features that make these tools even more useful. While we haven't yet highlighted the new activity launcher in our Wear 5.1 feature spotlights, you can find dedicated listings in that launcher for the timer, stopwatch, and alarm that were not present in the old "start" UI of Wear 5.0. </p>
<p> Android Wear 5.1 is surprisingly full of new features, and the lock screen may be one of the more exciting ones. Until now, there was no OS-level way to secure your Wear device from unauthorized use. With Wear 5.1, a pattern lockscreen has been introduced, and it should pop up any time Wear detects your device is no longer on your wrist. For a quick walkthrough of the feature, see the video below. </p>
<p> Setting up a lock screen is dead simple, just go into settings, find the lock screen option, and enter the 4-point-or-greater pattern you want to use (twice). At this point, your watch is set up to lock its screen whenever it no longer detects it's on your wrist. </p>
<p> App discovery on Android Wear isn't outstanding to start with, but one thing that always rubbed me the wrong way was just how blissfully unaware you could be that an app you had installed on your Android smartphone also installed a Wear mini-app on your watch. With Android Wear 5.1, you'll live in ignorance no longer: every time a new Wear app is installed on your watch, it'll serve up a notification letting you know, just like the one above (this is also true for watch faces). </p>
<p> Is it a small feature? Absolutely. But it's one of those things you're happy to have when you do, and might not even know you miss when you don't. </p>
<p> One thing that I've always found annoying about notification management on Android Wear is that dismissal is generally handled in bulk. If an app is serving you multiple notifications, like Inbox, for example, you can't go through each of those messages and dismiss them individually. Nope, you can either dismiss all of them or none of them (unless you use a specific action that subsequently dismisses the card, eg, "Done"). </p>
<p> Android Wear 5.1 appears to have addressed this in some apps, with the Inbox, Hangouts, and Calendar apps on Wear now allowing you to dismiss single cards from a larger stack, instead of having to swipe them away en masse. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi connectivity has been one of the real headline features for Android Wear 5.1, and rightly so: this new functionality will allow your Android Wear device to stay connected to the internet even when your phone is nowhere to be found (so long as you have a saved Wi-Fi network nearby). Here's what we've learned about the feature in using it so far, including a video primer of how to get it set up. </p>
<p> First things first: this feature will not allow you to use a Wear device without ever connecting it to a smartphone. An Android smartphone is still required, because things like entering the Wi-Fi network password take place on the paired phone rather than the watch itself. </p>

<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Wear OS apps and faces that went live on the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous six months or so. Since our last collection, Google has changed the branding from Android Wear to Wear OS, and there are finally devices in the market that contain the new Snapdragon 3100 chip, which allows for more features, such as a visible second hand when the ambient mode is on. While I'm sure the progress of Wear OS isn't moving as fast as enthusiasts would like, there's no arguing the platform isn't dead yet. </p>
<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Wear OS apps and faces that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous seven months or so. It's been a slow process cataloging each Wear release since February, but I think we finally have enough to push out another roundup of the best Wear OS has to offer. </p>
<p> Welcome to the roundup of the best new Android Wear faces that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous 3 months or so. </p>
<p> A new version of Play Music is available this afternoon and it's making a big leap in versions from 8.0 to 8.5. This update doesn't come with the redesign that had seemed likely after last month's visual refresh to Play Music on Android TV. But cosmetic touchups were in the cards as the adaptive icons for app shortcuts were fixed in this release. Additionally, Play Music lost some megabytes after unbundling its Wear app. </p>

<p> Okay, you may have noticed that it has been quite a while since the last Android Wear Roundup. The good news is that I am here to take the reins and get this thing going again. Since it has been such a long while, there are quite a few items to go through. This is why I have split the post into two separate pages, as it was way too long for a single page. Rest assured, I will be making sure this Roundup has more of a regular schedule in the future. But hey, enough of that nonsense, let's dig into a super long list of Android Wear apps and faces! </p>
<p> If you're among the crowd that both installs Android developer previews and also owns an Android Wear watch, you've probably noticed some of the apps that belong on your watch have been missing. This happens because the stock apps included with the developer previews are missing the micro-apks for Wear. As the official release of Android 7.0 draws near, Google has been slowly releasing app updates that can install over the stock versions on the developer preview. And as of yesterday's stream of updates, Google Messenger joins that list. </p>
<p> "The Beeb on your wrist" might be mistaken for Cockney slang by some poorly-travelled American blogger, but in this case it's the latest feature to hit the official BBC Worldwide news app. The update to 3.2 for BBC News UK and BBC News Worldwide will send short snippets of stories to your Android Wear device. The only other changes are bug fixes and some layout adjustments for the primary, non-wearable app. </p>
<p> BBC News on a watch is surprisingly usable. A title, header image, and short paragraph for each story are displayed in a sort of mini-RSS style. The layout lets you swipe horizontally and vertically: go up or down to move between the "Top Stories," "My News" (selected on the smartphone app), and "Most Read" categories, and swipe left or right to move between individual stories. </p>
<p> It seems like one out of every four searches I make sends me to Wikipedia for one thing or another - for example, the metric prefix atto- means 10 to the negative eighteenth power, or one quintillionth, or really quite amazingly bloody small. Google itself defaults to a lot of Wikipedia pages for its Knowledge Graph info, and you'll get small cards full of Wikipedia content for many searches from Android Wear. But developer Dheera Venkatraman (whose previous Wear apps Wear Camera Remote and Matrix face we've already written about) has an even better solution. </p>
<p> Attopedia is a surprisingly effective Wear app for browsing full Wikipedia pages. </p>

<p> wear os </p>
<p> Wear OS is far from being the most praised smartwatch operating system, an issue Google is well aware of. Thankfully, the company worked on improving it and introduced widget-like tiles in May. Sadly, these were capped to just five, a restriction that's now being lifted. </p>
<p> Wear OS has fallen by the wayside in recent years, but the updates coming with Android 11 offer some encouragement. Diesel has been experimenting with translucent designs for a while now, and the company's newest release takes it to the next level. The DT2023 is a limited-edition version of the Fadelite DT2021 watch. It's a collaboration between Diesel and digital artist Mad Dog Jones — and I don't know if I love it or hate it. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/09/08 10:11am PDTon Sep 8, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/09 11:09am PDTon Sep 9, 2020. </p>
<p> Google announced a pretty substantial Wear OS update last month, stating that it would be coming in the fall. We're still a couple weeks out from fall, but Finnish brand Suunto is already pushing this performance-improving update to its Suunto 7 watch. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/01/13 8:01am PSTon Jan 13, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/06 9:24am PDTon Sep 6, 2020. </p>
<p> These days, there are two primary options for Android-compatible smartwatches. You can use a watch powered by Google's own Wear OS software, or pick up a Galaxy Watch from Samsung. Both platforms get most of the basics right, but depending on which features you care about the most, one might be better than the other for you. </p>
<p> In this guide, we'll go over the key differences between both platforms, so you can make an informed smartwatch purchase. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/08/19 1:34pm PDTon Aug 19, 2020 and last updated 2020/08/21 11:14am PDTon Aug 21, 2020. </p>
<p> It's fair to say that Wear OS has been stagnating lately. Google announced a few updates for its smartwatch operating system last week, but they're more like minor improvements than the major overhaul many feel the platform needs. Fossil and its subsidiaries make a lot of Wear OS watches, and now the company is taking matters into its own hands with an exclusive update that adds new health-tracking capabilities, a Phone app tile, and more. </p>
<p> Google's Wear OS platform has been in a holding pattern for much of the past year, while the company waits for its acquisition of Fitbit to go through (or be shut down over antitrust lawsuits). Thankfully, Google hasn't completely forgotten about its existing wearable platform, as a new update is coming in the fall with some much-needed improvements. </p>
<p> Google Play Music is being phased out in favor of YouTube Music starting next month. That change already exacerbates the need for the latter to achieve a desirable feature parity with its predecessor, but it also now presents a challenging chasm for Wear OS users who will lose access to Play Music without a robust YouTube Music experience. </p>
<p> The Misfit Vapor X was released last year by Fossil Group, and has most of the bells and whistles you would expect in a modern Wear OS smartwatch. It started off at $280, but right now you can get it for as low as $15. No, you didn't read that wrong. </p>
<p> Back in March, Chinese manufacturer Oppo announced its first smartwatch, sporting a design similar to the one of an Apple Watch. The device, called the Oppo Watch, was exclusively meant to be sold on the Chinese Market and ran an in-house Android-based OS. However, a new promotional video seems to point the company is about to release a refreshed version of the product that will ship with Wear OS. </p>
<p> Mobvoi is one of the few companies still taking the future of Wear OS seriously and releasing new hardware. But today Mobvoi has a deal reaching into the past. The company's 2018 flagship smartwatch, the TicWatch Pro, is available on Amazon for just $139.99, a savings of $60 off recent prices. </p>

<p> weatherbug </p>
<p> There are uncountable multitudes of weather apps in the Play Store, which makes Earth Networks' latest move all the more perplexing. The company has removed its popular WeatherBug Elite app from the Play Store, much to the chagrin of paying users. We reached out to Earth Networks looking for specifics about the removal, and have learned that there will only be a single WeatherBug app going forward, and it will offer an ad-free experience in the form of an annual subscription. </p>
<p> WeatherBug has been a big name in online weather forecasting for a number of years, and it was one of the first full-featured weather apps on Android. The problem, however, is that the app looked like it was designed by inebriated orangutans. Well, no more. The WeatherBug app has been updated with new features and a streamlined (not ugly) UI. </p>
<p> The new app has Holo-style tabs up top along with a drop-down for your locations. </p>

<p> webassembly </p>
<p> Earlier today, our buds over at Chrome Unboxed spotted a new progressive web app by Google called Chrome Canvas. It's a very simple sketching/doodling app that works best on devices like Chromebooks with stylus-based input, but it will also run on your desktop or phone. The new app is showing up as an installed app on some Chromebooks running Dev and Canary channels, but you can pull it down manually on other devices right now. </p>
<p> After two years in development, the web-based Google Earth 9.0 debuted earlier this year. The new version runs entirely in the web browser, but it only works in Google Chrome. This is because it used Portable Native Client (NaCl), a technology that allows C and C++ code to run in the Chrome browser. Since no other browser bothered implementing NaCl, the Earth web app was exclusive to Chrome. </p>
<p> That is now changing, as the Twitter account for Google Earth revealed that Firefox support is in the works: </p>
<p> A few days after the release of Chrome 57 for the desktop, Google has started pushing out the latest update to Android users. This time around, Chrome has more controls for Chrome Custom Tabs, the ability to add recently-visited search engines, support for WebAssembly, and more. </p>
<p> Two days ago, Chrome 56 was released for Android with several major changes to both to the app itself and the web features it supports. As always, a new stable release means the next version - Chrome 57 - has entered the beta stage. Let's dig into the new features that Chrome 57 brings. </p>
<p> Most of the interactive content you see on the web (besides Flash) is powered by JavaScript, initially created by Netscape Navigator developers in 1995. As with the rest of the internet, it has grown and changed a good deal since then, but it's not perfect. JavaScript is a high-level language, meaning basic functions like garbage collection are handled by the JavaScript VM. WebAssembly has been in the planning stages for years, as an alternative to JavaScript for low-level applications, and it is now enabled by default in Chrome Canary 58. </p>

<p> WebM </p>
<p> Amidst news that Google has adopted a new logo (and everything that comes along with that), Sundar Pichai let slip that Google is joining the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix, and others to form the Alliance for Open Media (AOM). The organization's goal is to collaborate on open and royalty-free digital formats for "next-generation ultra high definition media." In other words, it will develop new image, audio, and video codecs and container formats that are totally free for non-commercial and commercial use. </p>
<p> The Alliance’s initial focus is to deliver a next-generation video format that is: </p>
<p> Interoperable and open; </p>
<p> Optimized for the web; </p>
<p> Scalable to any modern device at any bandwidth; </p>
<p> Designed with a low computational footprint and optimized for hardware; </p>
<p> Capable of consistent, highest-quality, real-time video delivery; and </p>
<p> Flexible for both commercial and non-commercial content, including user-generated content. </p>
<p> The moment we've been waiting for so many months - it's finally here! I can hardly contain my excitement as I'm writing this, but both Gingerbread and the Samsung Nexus S were officially announced 30 minutes ago. As expected, the new OS bears the version number 2.3 and brings updates to the SDK and the NDK as well SDK tools and the Eclipse ADT plugin. </p>
<p> As expected, a lot of the OS improvements are under-the-hood, which will result in better gaming, responsiveness, and overall Android experience. </p>
<p> New Features/Enhancements </p>
<p> OS/SDK/NDK </p>
<p> The new OS features and enhancements include: </p>
<p> enhancements for game development, including a new concurrent garbage collector, more native APIs, faster event distribution, updated video drivers, and new sensors (gyroscope) - this is amazing for developers; expect gaming to get a lot more responsive and versatile </p>
<p> lots and lots of attention in the above bullet point has been given to the NDK - the Native Development Kit. </p>

<p> webmaker </p>
<p> Webmaker is Mozilla's effort to make it easy for new smartphone users to make content for the web. Instead of creating something using WordPress or Blogger, people can throw materials together using a more simplistic interface. Webmaker has been available on the web since 2012, but now you can download an Android version directly from Google Play. </p>
<p> Mozilla is a champion of the web, and a core part of its mission has been supplying the open source Firefox browser. These days competitors like Chrome are eroding at its userbase, but they're doing so using many of the bullet points Mozilla emphasized—open source underpinnings, customization through add-ons, and speed. </p>
<p> Now Mozilla is pursuing its mission statement in other ways. One of the more well-known efforts would be the push to develop and sell Firefox phones. Another would be the lesser-known Webmaker initiative that empowers more people create material for the web and mobile devices. A beta version has made its way onto Google Play. </p>

<p> web store </p>
<p> Like many less prominent tech companies' stores, ASUS's US storefront is... lackluster. Its design looks straight out of 2005, it's not very well laid-out, and using it just isn't a great experience. Thankfully, ASUS recently created an eBay store, and we're hoping that it continues to work on and add more products to it. </p>
<p> After giving us a sneak peek back at I/O in May, Google has finally rolled out the new version of web Play Store. The new UI looks totally killer, but there's a big shakeup in the features to go along with that new interface, and not all of it is good news. After the Maps update fiasco, it's starting to look like Google is pulling features it doesn't feel are being used by enough people. In the case of the new web-based Play Store, that looks like a lot of stuff. Let's go over what's new and what's gone. </p>
<p> One of the neatest things about the Play Store is that, as long as you're signed in to your account on the web, you can install apps directly to your device without ever picking it up. Now, Google has integrated this functionality into Google+. If a user shares a link to an app on the Play Store, that friendly blue "Install" button will now be embedded directly in the post. A-like so: </p>
<p> This is a nifty new addition to Google+. Of course, the embeds don't include ratings, user reviews, or any of the other key information that everyone should probably at least glance at before installing apps on their devices. </p>
<p> Opera Software, makers of the popular browsers for desktops and mobile devices, today unveiled a mobile storefront for web apps called the Opera Mobile Store. The store, which racked up 15 million users during its February beta release, is available now on Android (as well as several other mobile operating systems). </p>
<p> Applications will be purchased, installed, and run via Opera's mobile browsers (Opera Mini or Opera Mobile). Opera's store is powered by web app company Appia, whose storefront commerce system will be used for payments. An Opera Publisher Portal, a platform for developers to create and dispense their apps, was released simultaneously. </p>
<p> Android users have been clamoring for an official online Android Market solution for ages, and today, El Goog finally delivered with the Android Market Web Store. Once the issues with the "Sign in" button (clicking it returned an 'Invalid Request' error) were fixed, we didn't think twice about delving in and giving it an in-depth look. Read on for our first impressions! </p>
<p> Front Page </p>
<p> The front page of market.android.com (aka the Android Market Web Store) is simple, clean, and sexy - just the way we like it. Across the very top, there are links to other Google services (i.e. Gmail, Calendar, Docs, etc.), </p>
<p> Oh yes, those juicy rumors about an online version of the Market were true - the "Android Market Web Store," as Google is calling it, is accessible now via market.android.com. </p>
<p> As you can see, a list of featured/best selling games populates the front page, along with a list of categories, a "Sign in" button (which, at the time of this writing, leads to an 'invalid request error'), and a "Search" function. Once you click on one of the apps, you are taken to a page somewhat like the one in the second screenshot, with a description, links to "Overview," "User Reviews," "What's New," and "Permissions" on top, as well as a list of related apps on the left side and a QR code and a "Tweet" button on the right side. </p>
<p> When Google closed up shop at their now ghost-town of a webstore, Nexus One owners were left without an outlet for official accessories, particularly the elusive HTC Nexus One Car Phone Holder (aka car dock). </p>
<p> With eBay sellers demanding upwards of $200 (and that’s used) for a device that once retailed for $59.99, it seemed Google and HTC had hung Nexus One owners out to dry. But now, HTC’s US online store (run by LetsTalk.com) and its UK sister site are offering up Nexus One goodies, Car Phone Holders included, once again. </p>
<p> I, for one, breathed quite a sigh of relief knowing I could still obtain my Nexus One car dock without handing over what currently represents my effective life savings. </p>
<p> Tmonews has leaked a T-Mobile retail partner sales FAQ in which it is explicitly states that T-Mobile will never again stock the Nexus One in their retail stores. </p>
<p> This would seem to be the last nail in the coffin for the Nexus One’s US tour, though it is still sold abroad in the UK and South Korea. While the document doesn’t explicitly preclude the possibility of online sales, “The Nexus One was sold and marketed by Google” is pretty damning. </p>
<p> Also, this document is addressed towards brick-and-mortar retailers, and thus it wouldn’t be relevant to mention T-Mobile’s online sales policy. I think it is safe to assume, though, that you won’t be seeing the Nexus One on T-Mobile’s web store anytime soon. </p>

Well if you want to stay ahead of the curve and keep wowing regular people with your mobile expertise, why not start adding images to your QR codes?

<p> Earlier this month HTC released details about their roll-out plans for its bootloader unlock process and the devices that would be supported. Today, in answer to some of the questions posed by HTC’s Facebook fans, HTC released an update on how the bootloader unlocking process will actually work and why HTC’s newest phones are still shipping with a locked bootloader. </p>
<p> As mentioned in their earlier post, HTC is continuing to make every effort to release OTA software updates within the month to enable unlocking of the HTC Sensation followed soon by the HTC Sensation 4G and the HTC EVO 3D. </p>

<p> weekend discussion </p>
<p> One of Android's greatest strengths is the platform's diversity, allowing manufacturers to customize as they see fit with their own tweaks and changes. Samsung fans, for example, often point at features that the company implemented first, which later trickled down into stock Android. While we're all probably familiar with most of the big headlining features from each company's software, what are your favorite lesser-known or underappreciated Android features? </p>
<p> Google has finally released Android 10 after six months of beta testing. As usual, Pixels have picked up this latest version, and the Essential Phone has continued its habit of timely updates. The last wave of OnePlus flagships also picked up Android 10, but only via the Open Betas. At the time of writing, Android 10 is still something of an exclusive club — have you updated to it? How do you like it? </p>
<p> Now that we've seen renders of both the front and back of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL (not to mention the previous renders and leaks), you've probably already come to some sort of judgment about the design. From the bigger square camera bump to the vertically asymmetrical bezels, there's a lot to like (or dislike) depending on your tastes. How do you feel? </p>
<p> With the next Android Q beta expected to be a release candidate, we've probably seen most of the upcoming features from Google's next big update. Even if you aren't adventurous enough to jump into the Beta Program yourself, you've probably seen some of our coverage on the subject — and if not, a full recap is here. We still have two more releases to look forward to, but so far, what's your favorite feature in Android Q? </p>
<p> Android 9 Pie officially landed just over a month ago, but we've been collectively anticipating the changes it brought since the first developer preview was released over six months ago. In that time, we've painstakingly assembled an extensive list of the features and tweaks Google delivered. Most of our readers probably know the details of this latest version backward and forward at this point, and so we're curious: If you could, what would you change in Android P? </p>
<p> Google I/O this year was absolutely packed full of exciting announcements not just for Android, but all sorts of stuff. From Project Soli and Jacquard to less exciting but much more practically relevant things like new Cast APIs, along with an absolutely slew of Android M features, there was a ton going on at this year's show. </p>
<p> So, what at this year's show got you most excited? There really was a lot, so much that we're still digging through it at all (especially in regard to Android M), so think carefully, and check out our feature spotlight series if you're not sure you're remembering everything. </p>
<p> As more and more Nexus devices get updated to Android 5.1.1 (and, in the Nexus 9's case, 5.1 in the first place), hopefully more and more issues people had with Android 5.0 and 5.1 are getting resolved. What I want to ask you is about your experience with the latest version of Android. Better? Worse? The same? </p>
<p> The Nexus 4, 5, 6, 7 (2012 and 2013), 9, and 10 [and Player] all have the update rolling out now with varying degrees of completeness, and factory images for all but the 6 are available. </p>
<p> So, let's talk. Android 5.1.1: what's better, what's worse, and what problems with 5.0/5.1 still aren't addressed? </p>
<p> This weekend's discussion should be one near and dear to all of hearts: our first Android phone. When did you buy it? What phone was it? Why did you pick it? Was it terrible? Great? Liberating? Life-changing? (Hey, you never know!) </p>
<p> Android is obviously a common thread for all of us, and our first Android phone was what strung us along to this point, reading (and in my case, later writing for) Android Police and talking about obscure phones and Lollipop and Google Play Services and tons of other things that many people have no freaking clue even really exist. But that's what makes a community great, right? </p>
<p> Smartwatches are easily the hottest new form factor in tech in the last year or so, and considering we're already on generation two (OK, maybe more like 1.5) of Android Wear hardware, you'd think smartwatches were pretty much a sure thing. Everybody's going to wear one, there's going to be a gigantic 3rd party app ecosystem, and it's going to be just like the smartphone boom years! Smartwatches will be indispensible to our daily lives. </p>
<p> Except, well, there are lots of good reasons to not believe that. Smartwatches have so far presented a pretty lame value proposition - doing little more than the smartphones they're connected to, while costing nearly as much (or a lot more). </p>
<p> We're back to discussion mode this weekend, and this weekend's discussion may require some thought. Increasingly, I've noticed an interesting side effect to the ever-larger smartphones we carry: people don't seem as interested in tablets anymore as a result. I know that when I'm using my Nexus 6, I'm much likelier to place that on my bedside table than I am my iPad for my morning email and reading, because it's a bit more comfortable to hold and type on, but still gives me plenty of room to watch videos or bang out an appreciably long email. </p>
<p> I'm not sure if I'd say I don't want a tablet as much as I used to, but I will say that I am much pickier about what I want my tablet to be as a result. </p>

<p> Phones charge faster and last longer than they ever have before, but they still require power to work. Since you've got to plug them in at some point, odds are you have a daily habit. So we're curious to know: When do you usually charge your phone? </p>
<p> Anecdotally, even though most of my phones can go more than a day between charges, I still plug in every night to keep it topped up for the next day. (That is, unless I'm reviewing a phone, in which case I'll try to run it absolutely dry at least a few times.) But in general, my caveman brain says full=good, leaving me with less worry starting each day at 100%. </p>
<p> With our modern super-fast charging speeds, I wouldn't be surprised to hear that many of our readers have specific habits to stretch out battery longevity. After all, sitting at full all night does slightly increase long-term wear on the battery. Some phones even adjust how charging works to reduce that. And you can just as easily plug some phones in when you wake up and have it charged by your morning coffee or shower. </p>
<p> We're sure charging habits vary, and I bet some of you feel strongly about yours, so we're curious to hear about it. When do you plug your phone in? </p>
<p> At night. </p>
<p> In the morning. </p>
<p> During the day. </p>

<p> Welcome </p>
<p> Google appears to be testing a new welcome page for its Chrome browser. The change jazzes up the previously boring, mostly blank white page with a splattering of colorful shapes, larger text, and bigger buttons — though it seems to be in a very limited rollout for the time being. </p>
<p> Last month, Google announced that it would be unifying its storage service under a new name: Google One. The transition from previous plans to better-priced One options was to take place "in the coming months," and reports of the rollout have been gradually spreading. If you're among those with a paid Google Drive storage plan anticipating the move, you might want to check your email, as some that have been welcomed into Google One are seeing a complimentary $5 credit hit their inbox. </p>

<p> Belkin has produced smart home products for years under its Wemo brand, but Wemo devices have never had the best reputation. Most of its previous products suffered from connectivity and software issues, and when so many alternative options exist for smart plugs or internet-connected lights, there wasn't much of a point in purchasing Wemo products. </p>
<p> Thankfully, Wemo is starting to address its long-running software problems. The company switched to an online account system earlier this year, paving the way for a more streamlined experience. Wemo has also released a new smart plug, which is incredibly compact and actually works properly. </p>
<p> When it comes to setting up a smart home infrastructure, there's a bunch of brands to chose from. If you have a tendency to trust major ones more than unknown manufacturers, you'd be happy to know Belkin's Wemo WiFi smart plug, which was announced at CES earlier this year, is now available for sale. </p>
<p> Wemo's smart home products are far from perfect, with sometimes-difficult setup processes, tricky integration with third-party services, and an Android app that currently has 2/5 stars on the Play Store. Some of those issues stem from how Wemo doesn't have a unified account system, but the company is fixing that today. </p>
<p> For years we've dreamed of the smart home, but when we anticipated it, we didn't really picture a dozen hubs littered all over our house that do nothing but control only one type of device. Sadly, that's the truth we've come to. But Google seems to be taking the first steps to remedy this situation, starting with opening local control of smart devices to all developers and smart home manufacturers. </p>
<p> The Wemo Mini Smart Plug can turn virtually any dumb appliance into an intelligent, app-connected accessory that can be controlled from your favorite smartphone. Today, Wemo is selling its mini smart plug for the lowest price we've ever seen at just $16 ($19 off) for a single plug and $59 ($26 off) for a triple pack on Amazon. </p>
<p> Smart lighting may seem frivolous (and it totally is), but once you use it for a while, you start to see the benefit. An inexpensive way to try it out is with a smart light switch, and right now, Wemo's Wi-Fi-enabled switch is just $27.99 on Amazon, $22 off its normal $49.99 price. </p>
<p> For years, Taiwan-based Foxconn has been best-known for manufacturing Apple products, but it also builds countless other consumer electronics. Today, one of the company's subsidiaries (Foxconn Interconnect Technology) announced it is purchasing US-based Belkin for $866 million in cash. Belkin owns a number of major brands, including Linksys and Wemo. </p>
<p> With a couple of months of use behind me, my feelings about the Belkin WeMo switches are just as conflicted now as they were when I unpacked these. On paper, the idea of a switch that you can plug anything in to make it smart is fantastic. In reality, I struggled to find many, if any honestly, devices I wanted to use the WeMo with. But that's not even the meat of my issue with WeMo's switches. Their connectivity has been iffy at best, the app is laughably old, and integration with other smart home devices is hit and miss, mostly because of the aforementioned connectivity issues. </p>
<p> One of the biggest trends in consumer technology over the last few years has been the rise of the smart home. The number of different device categories that now make up the 'Internet of Things' (IoT) has grown immensely, with connected appliances now found in many households across the US and beyond. </p>
<p> The smart home was once an expensive hobby for tech-fiends only but has now become an affordable aspiration for normal people. You can get started for less than $30 these days, with some lights or a smart switch that can connect to your Wi-Fi network and be controlled with your phone. </p>
<p> 'Tis the season for things to go on sale, and sometimes more than one sale. The Google Home Mini is already discounted $20 for the holiday season, and Target will also knock $20 more off if you also pick up a Wemo smart plug. It's quite a festive deal. </p>

<p> Fitbit's Ionic smartwatch was the brand's first product to feature an SpO2 sensor, which is used in estimating blood oxygen levels. Several other Fitbit products, namely the Versa, Versa Lite, Versa 2, and Charge 3, came with a similar sensor, but it had stayed dormant until December. After being tested with a few users, the feature appears to be rolling out more widely. </p>
<p> Didn't make it to Google I/O? Well, Motorola wants you to get a closer look at the Moto 360 smart watch anyway. In a two minute video demo, we get to see a few watch faces, notifications, and more. </p>
<p> Of particular interest in this video is the way the display works. When not in use, the Moto 360 display appears to be on, but very dim. So you'd be able to look at your wrist and see the time without touching it. To wake the display, simply press the button on the side or tap the screen. It's not clear from the video if the display will be completely off when you arm is at your side, but that has been the belief recently. </p>

<p> The Lone Ranger has been a real flop for Disney thus far, and I'm sure I know why. The company was late to debut an Android game to coincide with the release. Many of this summer's other successful blockbusters - Man of Steel, Monsters University, and Despicable Me 2 - all had games that predated or matched their theater debuts. While this form of marketing has never had any effect on me, it's apparently what the masses want, and Disney has since resolved the issue. </p>
<p> On paper, it seemed like a winning formula: take a bunch of cowboys, pit them against invading aliens, and see who comes out of it alive. Hot on the heels of a major theatrical release, GameLoft is releasing a Cowboys & Aliens game to the Market. </p>
<p> However, instead of the star-studded film (which, if you figure the $89 million earnings and $160 budget, was a huge flop), this game chooses to focus on the comic they used as source material. </p>

<p> If Prime Day shopping has led you to picking up some fun new gear, there's a decent chance you're also looking for some accessories to make the best of it. One of the most common add-ons you'll need for that new drone or camera is some extra storage. It will come as no surprise that Amazon has you covered there, too — microSD cards, SD cards, thumb drives, SSDs, hard drives, and even NAS systems in any capacity for any particular situation. </p>
<p> If you've been looking to pick up a few microSD cards, today is the day of the week to do it: Amazon has opened up its Gold Box and is featuring sales on a few SanDisk microSD cards and a lot of savings to pass around, whether you need 200GB or 512GB. </p>
<p> Since the Department of Commerce added Chinese manufacturer Huawei to its 'Entity List,' thus limiting its ability to import U.S.-made products, we've seen some of the company's most important supplier relationships take a hit. Alphabet may have been the vendor with the highest profile as many of Huawei's Android products rely on software services from Google. But chip producers, including one in Germany, have also had to limit their ties to the telecommunications company. </p>
<p> If you find that today's largest microSD cards just aren't enough for you, SanDisk has you covered. The company just announced the 1TB Extreme at MWC, a ridiculous amount of storage in a tiny, tiny form factor. It won't come cheap, though, ringing it at a staggering $449.99 MSRP. </p>
<p> IFTTT is a godsend solution for people who use different services and platforms and wish they could make them work better together. The idea of tying triggers from one device to actions on another is especially practical in the smart home, and even more so when you can use Google Home to control all those devices through IFTTT even if they don't have direct Assistant integration - yet. </p>
<p> With that said, IFTTT has just added support for 3 new products through new channels. </p>
<p> USB-C seems to get more widely used with every passing day - ASUS's new ZenFones all have USB-C charging ports - and that is no more apparent than when SanDisk, a major manufacturer of storage devices (until Western Digital acquired the company last month) announces new USB-C flash drives, with a normal USB-A port on the other end for convenient movement of files. </p>
<p> The new flash drives, catchily named "SanDisk Ultra Dual Drive USB Type-C flash drives," are faster (thanks to USB 3.1), reversible, and have multiple purposes, according to the vice president of SanDisk product marketing at Western Digital, Dinesh Bahal. While more and more smartphones are using the connector to charge the battery, very few laptops have USB-C ports at the moment, making a full-size USB a necessity, at least for the time being. </p>
<p> There are plenty of network-attached storage ("NAS") solutions available, however if you are a fan of Western Digital, you may be the owner of their My Book Live line of devices (available much cheaper on Amazon). Although reviews indicate that it is a solid product, it lacks a convenient method of remotely accessing the data, especially considering its MioNet solution is "nearly useless." Owners of this NAS will be pleased to hear that WD has launched the WD 2go Android app that helps bridge the remote access gap by providing an alternative method of viewing the content on your NAS. </p>

<p> WF-1000XM3 </p>
<p> There are a few unusual things about the Xperia 1 II, including the super-tall display and the stupid name, but arguably the most unusual thing is the price. Back when B&H first put the One-Two up for pre-order, we were amazed at that $1,198 price, and thought that Sony might be reconsidering the price when the number was taken down. However, Sony confirmed that price a few days later, though it did mention it'd be throwing in a free pair of WF-1000XM3s for pre-orders. </p>
<p> The Xperia 1 II, with its 4K HDR OLED display and 5G-capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 865, is going to cost every penny we thought we would and a couple dollars more. Customers who intend on reserving a device in the month of June will find themselves handsomely rewarded when the phone finally ships on July 24 — yep, that's going to be a while from now. </p>
<p> Are you in the market for some wireless earbuds? If so, one of the best options around — Sony's WF-1000XM3 — is now just $198.00 from multiple retailers. That's $31 below the usual cost, and the lowest recorded price for the earbuds yet. </p>
<p> It's rare that earbuds get significant new features after launch, but Sony is doing that for the WF-1000XM3 true wireless earbuds. The WF-1000MX3s were already fantastic, but now they've gotten even better with Alexa support, volume controls, and more. </p>
<p> Sony's WH-1000XM3 over-ear headphones have been lauded for their audio fidelity and noise cancellation since they launched, but not everyone wants to devote so much space in their bag to headphones. Enter, the WF-1000XM3, a set of true wireless earbuds that promise a high-quality audio experience with active noise cancelation. The WF-1000XM3s are bulkier than most other true wireless earbuds, but you get something for that extra mass. These earbuds offer superb sound and effective noise cancellation almost on par with Sony's full-sized headphones. They're spendy at $230, but this is one of those times you get what you pay for. </p>
<p> When it comes to over-ear headphones with active noise cancellation, Sony's WH-1000XM3 are probably the best in class, but the Japanese tech giant hasn't yet wowed us with an equally impressive pair of true wireless earbuds. That could be set to change, however, with the introduction of the (also obtusely named) WF-1000XM3, coming next month for $230/£220/€250. </p>

<p> WH-1000XM4 </p>
<p> You're probably surfing Prime Day for some sweet tech deals, and audio equipment is no exception. Sony's WH-1000XM4s are the top of the line in Bluetooth audio, and their price reflects that — though today that price is a little bit lower. The XM4s are on sale for $298 ($52 off), plus you get a free $25 gift card from Amazon. </p>
<p> Sony has been making noise-canceling headphones for years, and it's gotten pretty good at it. We had very few complaints about Sony's WH-1000XM3 headphones, so there wasn't much to fix in the latest iteration. Still, Sony listened to customer feedback and made several notable improvements in the new WH-1000XM4. They still sound phenomenal, but Sony added wear detection, some new Bluetooth tricks, and made the noise cancelation even more effective. At the same time, the XM4s look almost identical to the last-gen headphones. They don't look ugly or cheap, but the design isn't as striking as I'd expect from the best noise-canceling headphones on the market. </p>
<p> Noise-canceling headphones are no longer rare—you can even get a passable pair for well under $100 now. However, Sony still makes some of the best over-ear Bluetooth headphones money can buy, and now Sony is ready to take your money for the new WH-1000XM4 cans. These headphones look very similar to the popular WH-1000XM3s, but Sony added a few new features, and improved noise-canceling. Pre-orders are up today for $350, the same as the XM3s at launch. </p>
<p> Sony's WH-1000XM3 headphones (above) are among the best when it comes to over-the-ear Bluetooth audio, and it looks like the successor will be launching soon. Just a few weeks ago, a teardown of the Sony's Headphones Connect app uncovered some features that the upcoming WH-1000XM4 would bring. Now, a listing for the 1000XM4 has appeared on Walmart's website. </p>
<p> Sony's WH-1000XM3 headphones are pretty much the gold standard for over-ear Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones, topping the recommendation lists everywhere, including here. Building upon everything Sony's accomplished (including the derpy name), details surrounding the upcoming WH-1000XM4 have leaked courtesy of a teardown of Sony's Headphones Connect app. </p>

<p> what has science done </p>
<p> For a lot of us kiddos back in the late 90's, Furbies were something of a craze. I know I had at least one of the retrospectively terrifying gadgets—though I'm at a loss to remember why, exactly, I thought it was cool. Whatever my youthful motivations may have been, enterprising hobbyist Zack of howchoo fame has turned our collective childhood memories into an intelligent Lovecraftian abomination. Meet Furlexa. </p>
<p> Video on your watch. Video... on your watch. Yup, it's a thing now. And not just any video, millions and millions of videos (at least 20% of which feature cats) on the world's biggest distribution service. Pack it in, NASA. Hit the showers, CERN. Go suck eggs, DARPA. There's no need to try anymore: now that we've got a YouTube app for Android Wear, humanity has reached its absolute peak. </p>
<p> Video for Android Wear & YouTube comes from appfour, the developer of AIDE, Gmail for Wear, and the Android Wear web browser. In that context this is sort of a natural progression, but it's still hard to think of the app as anything more than a novelty. </p>

<p> whatsapp </p>
<p> Do you trade more voice messages than texts with your contacts? You may appreciate the ability to do that with the help of Google Assistant as it gains dedicated command branches for sending clips. That means you can even do it hands-free while driving! </p>
<p> Early last year, Facebook promised that it would create a unified backend for all of its messaging platforms. Messenger, Instagram direct messages, and WhatsApp are all supposed to be interoperable, so you wouldn't have to worry about which Facebook app to use with which of your contacts. It looks like the company is getting ready to make these cross-platform chats a reality, as it has started distributing a popup on Instagram that advertises a Messenger integration. </p>
<p> WhatsApp's search function has never been great. It does help you find your conversations and certain keywords if you know what you're looking for, but it has always only displayed text as results. WhatsApp wants to change that, as WABetaInfo and our tipster Moshe have spotted. The developers are testing an Advanced Search mode that helps you narrow down your results with specific filters, like text, images, videos, GIFs, audio, and more. </p>
<p> WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, but that also means a lot of misinformation and rumors are shared on the platform. Separating fact from fiction is important, especially with everything this year has thrown at us. Now WhatsApp is starting to roll out a feature that lets users quickly search Google for frequently shared messages to see if there's more info online. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/03/31 9:09am PDTon Mar 31, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/26 5:09am PDTon Jul 26, 2020. </p>
<p> WhatsApp has managed to reach a worldwide audience and break through 2 billion monthly users despite a severe handicap: The app doesn't support multiple devices for the same account. One phone number equals one phone or one tablet, that's always been the equation. And while there are workarounds to allow two different numbers on the same phone (for dual-SIM devices or Business users), there hasn't been any trick to make the same number available on two phones or tablets simultaneously. The great news is that WhatsApp is already working on this. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/27 1:10am PDTon Apr 27, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/11 9:25am PDTon Jul 11, 2020. </p>
<p> If you have a dual SIM phone, you already know the tremendous convenience the experience can provide. But for all the benefits, there are still apps out there that don't really recognize the dual SIM use case, like WhatsApp. Traditionally, using two WhatsApp accounts on a single smartphone wasn't really possible, but many phones now include built-in features like app cloning or work profiles that allow you to keep two instances of a single app on your device. Even if your phone doesn't have such an option, we've got other ways to work around this annoying limitation in our guide. Read on for more. </p>

<p> Last year, Google introduced integrations with WhatsApp that would let you start an audio or video call on the app via Assistant. While the feature is now widely available, the actual commands you need to use to utilize it are a little less than intuitive. You need to phrase things just so in order for Assistant to understand you actually want to use WhatsApp to make a call, which is mildly annoying. Fortunately, we've got a quick and easy guide to get you fluent in Google Assistant speak. </p>
<p> India’s biggest telecom operator Reliance Jio got richer by billions of dollars in the last couple of months with funds coming from left, right, and center. But it seems that instead of finding some good use for all that cash on hand, the company’s been busy cloning popular apps to offer its own alternatives. Last week, JioMeet was called out for being a Zoom rip-off, and now Jio is back with JioChat, which looks like a photocopy of WhatsApp. </p>
<p> Early last year, we got word that Facebook was considering cross-platform chats between WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger, running on a unified, encrypted backend. After the first small steps towards compatibility in the form of Messenger Rooms in WhatsApp, we now see this cross-app integration taking shape. According to WABetaInfo, a few hints have appeared in Facebook Messenger that reveal how the company is working on a way to contact WhatsApp users through the app. </p>

<p> WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, and it's only been getting more feature-rich thanks to recent updates like profile sharing via QR codes and animated stickers in chats. But the company isn't neglecting the basics either, and it's now adding a dark mode for the desktop and web. The rollout has started and will continue over the next couple of weeks. </p>

<p> whatsapp status </p>
<p> According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, Facebook has halted its plans to introduce ads in WhatsApp's Status feed. Talk of advertisements in WhatsApp, and specifically interspersed among ephemeral statuses, has been going for over a year, with the service's VP confirming that in October of 2018. But those plans seem to be paused, for now at least. </p>
<p> Despite WhatsApp's near-ubiquity in my region, its Status feature has failed to gain much traction even though it's been available for over two years. Some of my friends love it and post multiple updates per day, but they're a clear minority. Yet, WhatsApp seems to think there's hidden potential in statuses and has already announced that ads would be coming to it in 2020. Another feature now rolling out in beta is the ability to share a status to other apps, most notably Facebook. </p>
<p> In what appears to be a server-side update to the service, WhatsApp has announced a new "statuses" feature today that really isn't about chat status so much as it is a rip-off of Snapchat's Stories (which was earlier ripped off by Instagram last year). If you know what Snapchat Stories is, you know what today's WhatsApp update is: it really is that similar. Take a look at the video and screenshots below. </p>

<p> WhatsApp Web </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/07/01 10:51am PDTon Jul 1, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/07 5:31am PDTon Jul 7, 2020. </p>
<p> WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, and it's only been getting more feature-rich thanks to recent updates like profile sharing via QR codes and animated stickers in chats. But the company isn't neglecting the basics either, and it's now adding a dark mode for the desktop and web. The rollout has started and will continue over the next couple of weeks. </p>
<p> A year ago, WhatsApp added picture-in-picture video playback in its iOS app. It wasn't until October that the feature made its way to Android in beta, then a few weeks ago, it rolled out to the stable version of the app. Now, it's making the switch from mobile to desktop, as PIP videos have appeared on WhatsApp Web. </p>
<p> Last January, Facebook launched WhatsApp Business, targeting small businesses looking to communicate with customers over WhatsApp. The app lets owners set up profiles with email addresses, working hours, and location details, along with a certain degree of automation: quick replies, Gmail-style labeling of conversations, and filters. This functionality had been specific to the Android app so far, but that changes today — WhatsApp Business users can now enjoy these features on the desktop and web app too. </p>
<p> We don't often cover WhatsApp Web here since it's not exactly Android, but it's related enough to the Android app that we do make an exception every now and then when there's something worth talking about. Today is one of those examples, but it's worth pointing out that some of these changes aren't new and have been there for a while — maybe even for a month or two. But again, we had to wait until there was enough news to warrant a post. </p>
<p> WhatsApp Web has been available for about half a year, and in the time since its announcement, it only got some minor changes like skin tone emojis. However, the service has received a backend update that adds a lot of the mobile app's features, making it easy for you to manage your conversations from the web interface without having to grab your phone. We don't know when exactly these changes were implemented, but they seem quite new to us. </p>
<p> First up, your profile photo and status are editable now. Simply hover over your photo and you'll get the option to change it. An edit icon appears next to the status and lets you share all of your feels with your contacts. </p>
<p> Deep breaths. It's happening. WhatsApp Web just went live. Wait, where did you run off to scrolling to the bottom of the page for the link? I have important things to discuss here, like the latest Archer episode. Literally. OK, OK, I won't stall any longer. </p>
<p> The web service, which we first heard about last month, has been officially announced on WhatsApp's blog. As the rumors suggested, it relies on the mobile WhatsApp application as the authenticator through a QR code authorization. It works for WhatsApp users on Android, Windows Phone, and Blackberry (and Symbian!), but not iOS. </p>
<p> One of the hindrances of using WhatsApp as your main messaging platform, like most of us do in my part of the world, is that you're tied to your phone (or connected tablet). WhatsApp doesn't authenticate you with usernames or passwords, instead requiring a SIM card to work on any device. It had thus far been completely alien (aside from "hacked" solutions like WhatsRemote) to our desktops and full, comfortable, typing-friendly keyboards. That is in contrast to its competitors, Line, Viber, Telegram, and WeChat, which have all developed a desktop counterpart to their mobile solutions. But WhatsApp's lag might be changing, well, sometime down the line. </p>

<p> what’s on my screen </p>
<p> Google Assistant has become quite notorious for its fickle features. One day something works, the other not. An excellent example of that is "What's on my screen?" which has disappeared and reappeared so many times we've nearly lost count. The last time it went away was in May of 2019, and now nine months later, it's making a surprise comeback. </p>
<p> Google Assistant does a lot of things. This invisible artificial intelligence residing (partly) inside our devices can answer all kinds of questions, control our homes, help us plan our day, play our favorite music, and, with the addition of features like What's on my screen and Google Lens, glean more from what we're looking at and provide contextual answers. What you may not be aware of, and something I recently discovered (though it isn't very new), is that Assistant can read your screen even when you don't explicitly ask it what's on your screen. That has the potential to be very handy, but also extremely creepy if you didn't know it was possible. </p>
<p> Long before Google Lens could be used to understand text and objects in photos you take, a feature called Now on Tap was introduced to analyze what was on your screen and bring you relevant search results relating to what it found. Of course, Google Now is no longer, and Now on Tap has morphed into a screen search function as part of the Google Assistant. It appears to be broken for some people at the moment, however. </p>

<p> what to expect </p>
<p> We're just a week out from Google's October 15th hardware event, at which the company is expected to announce a pile of products, including the much-leaked Pixel 4. But there will be more to the next Made by Google event than just a new phone, plenty of other hardware (and software) is expected to land. Let's work through the list so that you know what to expect. </p>
<p> Google's yearly hardware event is nearly upon us. In this day and age, there are always bits of information leaked ahead of official announcements, but this event is completely different. Google has been as leaky as the Titanic over the past few months, so there's a good chance there aren't any surprises left. </p>
<p> If you've been living under a rock this whole time, or you haven't been able to keep track of all the leaks, we've summarized everything we know about the products Google will (probably) announce tomorrow. </p>
<p> After seeing a deluge of rumors, leaks, and hoax after hoax this season, it looks like we're finally starting to wind down. With Google's Android event a mere 8 days away, it's time to clear away the muck and take a look at what we expect to make an appearance just a couple days before Halloween. Let's start with the stuff we're most confident in and work our way down, shall we? </p>
<p> Android 4.2 Jelly Bean </p>
<p> We were already fairly confident that the next version of Android would not be 5.0. While Google is inconsistent with its naming and number scheme, The company does tend to at least save full number releases for big changes (2.0 brought a huge face lift, Navigation and the Droid, 3.0 introduced tablets, 4.0 brought tablets and phones together under the biggest UI change yet). </p>

<p> what we use </p>
<p> It has been a year and a half since my last 'What We Use' post, where I explained what technology and products I used on a regular basis. Nearly every aspect of that post is now out of date — in my never-ending quest to find what devices, services, and applications are best for me, my arsenal of technology has completely changed. </p>
<p> I've upgraded my desktop, switched phones, bought and sold two laptops, and purchased a car. Like all 'What We Use' posts from the AP staff, this is mostly an opportunity for me to ramble about technology I like. </p>
<p> I spend my days writing about technology, and I spend much of my remaining time playing with it for fun. Consequently, I have a lot of nerdy stuff that's become integral to my life, and maybe you're interested in what it all is. It's been almost two years since I did a "what we use" post, and a lot has changed. My preferred phones are different, of course, but I've fallen deep down the mechanical keyboard rabbit hole, too. Events have also conspired against me to require that I build a new desktop computer. Here are all the things (mostly keyboards) that I can't live without. </p>
<p> So here we are already elbows-deep into 2017. Let me start off by saying that I love this job — I work with and I have met some great and intelligent people. By some miracle, I have earned the "right" to write up one of these posts. Now is your chance to see into the other side of your screen to get a glimpse of how I bring you such profound content. </p>
<p> You may recall Android Police's long-running 'What We Use' series, where the fantastic people that work here share the tech (and sometimes non-tech) products they use on a frequent basis. </p>
<p> I haven't actually written one of these posts yet - simply because I only joined AP last year. I've had a fascination with technology as long as I can remember, but my arsenal of toys is constantly changing. So without further ado, this is what I use. </p>
<p> This week's Android Police podcast is a bit different - it's all about stuff! As in, the stuff we use. We take a full episode to just talk about the various tools, gadgets, gizmos, and toys that we like. We do these kinds of posts on the site, so we figured why not an episode of the podcast? We've got some select items featured on the show that you can buy below, too. </p>
<p> When I was in my 20s, I was all about tinkering with things. I strived to always be at maximum geekiness. I built my own computers, it was Windows and Linux all the way, it was all about how much I could squeeze out of my tech. Then I got older. I'm 36 now, and as time has gone on, I've moved away from all that. These days, I prefer my tech to just work and actually allow me to get stuff done. I don't really care about the inner workings of things as much as I used to, or how much geek cred a particular piece of tech gives me. </p>
<p> My first computer was an old laptop with a dead battery and a dial-up modem. It ran Windows XP, but I didn't have the money to buy expensive software like Microsoft Office or PhotoShop. I discovered OpenOffice.org, AbiWord, and GIMP. I used Firefox, Thunderbird, and Pidgin. </p>
<p> Back then free cloud services weren't yet around, and I didn't have a strong enough Internet connection even if they were. Without an understanding of what open source software was, such applications gradually formed the majority of what I used. When I later went to college, I embraced Linux, and my appreciation for open source software grew. </p>
<p> I consider myself quite lucky to be able to make a living writing things on the internet because it gives me an outlet for my natural geekery. Even if I had never started crafting snarky blog posts on a daily basis, I suspect many of the things on this list would still be in my office (I guess then I'd call it something else). However, in this version of reality, I'm a professional nerd, and these are the things that I use every day. </p>
<p> In 2012, we started a series called "What We Use," where we, the AP staff, talked about the stuff that we can't live without. It started off as something where we just discussed our Android devices and computers, but last year we took that a step further (at Artem's request, no less) and discussed a lot more than that, basically covering everything that we love in our lives. The most important stuff to us, as people. </p>
<p> It's been over a year since my last WWU post, and you probably know what that means: time for a new one. I actually really enjoy writing these posts, and I hope you enjoy reading it. </p>
<p> Howdy. The name's Michael Crider, and I hope you've noticed that I've been hanging around here for the last year or so. I'm a web writer and general geek, born in Texas and now living in Colorado Springs. How I came to work for Android Police over the last 12 months (or possibly a bit longer) is a long and boring story. </p>
<p> Here are the bullet points you need to get context on the following exploration of my stuff: my dad was a computer engineer who worked for General Dynamics and Lockheed back in the 80s, and so I've been surrounded by varying bits of technology for essentially my entire life. </p>

<p> The Galaxy S20 is an incredibly expensive phone, no matter which one you buy, with the range-topping S20 Ultra starting a jaw-dropping $1400. When you're carrying a phone that's more expensive than some people's first cars, it's understandable that you'll want to buy a good case to keep it crack-free. Glass sandwiches may be all the rage in phone design right now, but there's no denying they're fragile, and picking a case to protect your new investment can be tough, especially with so many names and brands out there to choose from. We've got reviews of some of the top cases from brands like Spigen, Speck, Poetic, dbrand, Supcase, Pitaka, Ringke, and Samsung itself. </p>

<p> Google quickly cracked down on apps claiming to help diagnose or detect the COVID-19 coronavirus, except those verified to come from health agencies. Now the World Health Organization (WHO) has published an Android app for COVID-19, designed to offer basic safety guidance and provide up-to-date news. </p>
<p> Google Now is a powerful tool. A step toward Google's vision of a Star Trek computer in the palm of your hand, Now is built to serve up information that you need, exactly when you need it, without you asking for it. </p>
<p> To that end, the service has seen many improvements since its debut. It will tell you when your favorite teams are playing, when you need to leave to make it to the airport on time, whether your plane is delayed, and plenty of info about your destination and surrounding attractions, among numerous other things. </p>
<p> One of the more impressive features of Now is its ability to set really smart reminders. </p>

<p> why does it cost so much </p>
<p> In this job I work with a lot of public relations people. Their task is similar to mine, but in the opposite direction: while the responsibility of tech journalists is to present consumers with information that helps them make buying decisions, PR agents are generally instructed to drive sales by getting the news out. There's nothing wrong with the profession itself, and I've known great PR agents and those who are not so great. But I often look across the professional aisle and feel profound sympathy for my counterparts on the corporate side of tech media. </p>
<p> When it comes to insane, flashy, over-the-top launchers, two immediately come to mind: GO Launcher's Next and TSF Shell. They're both about as "cutting edge" as it gets, and have a price tag to match – Next is roughly $16, while TSF is closer to $17. Still, if you're a fan of the latter (or have been on the fence about picking it up), it just got a pretty sizable update that brings a new dock, "desktop menu buttons," and some other "amazing" new features: </p>
<p> What's in this version: </p>
<p> Version 1.9.9 Ari 4th 1.Innovative Smart Dock (free size/position/direction/capacity). 2.Desktop menu buttons integrate in Smart Dock, easy operation and save desktop space. </p>

<p> The folks over at Android Authority today have an exclusive that confirms the specifications and appearance of the Moto X4. Just yesterday photos of a real device leaked, but now the precise details of Motorola's upcoming phone are known quantities. And those numbers and names look pretty good on paper, especially when it comes to the cameras. </p>
<p> Smartphone cameras have quickly taken over as the primary point-and-shoot for many people, and while they offer up a quick way to take a shot, their use is still fairly limited. If you're looking to get more out of your smartphone's camera, then these add-on lenses may be just what the doctor ordered. </p>
<p> What Are They? </p>
<p> They're small lenses that bring three commonly used mods to your smartphone camera: wide angle/macro, fisheye, and telephoto. They're very simple to use, but I'll warn you upfront - they do require a bit of modification to your phone in order to work. What sort of mod, you ask? </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/wi-fi-6/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485102" filename="wi-fi-6">
<p> Qualcomm revealed the budget Snapdragon 768G just last month, but now the company is announcing another System-On-a-Chip intended for mid-range devices. The Snapdragon 690 will appear in phones later this year, and it aims to bring 5G connectivity to more affordable price points. </p>
<p> CES 2020 gave the networking device market a solid head start for the rest of the year. We not only saw a more capable Wi-Fi standard come into being but also mainstream brands jumping in with a pile of new routers and mesh systems. Besides an expanded security camera lineup, D-Link’s CES announcement includes a long list of routers and range extenders that integrate the EasyMesh and Wi-Fi 6 standard. </p>
<p> The latest Wi-Fi 6 standard was established to increase the efficiency of the 2.4GHz and 5GHz spectrum that users have been relying on for decades. Unfortunately, as more of the devices we buy eat up precious bandwidth, these connections can still become congested and slow down like a highway during rush hour. To usher in a faster, more capable generation of high-speed data, the Wi-Fi Alliance has announced a new 6GHz spectrum dubbed Wi-Fi 6E. </p>
<p> Wi-Fi 6 has been around for months, if not years, but we’re yet to see a wave of mass-market routers and mesh systems supporting the latest standard — even Google’s Nest Wifi eschewed it. That is set to change in 2020 as mainstream networking brands like TP-Link are already taking the lead. The company yesterday refreshed its Deco line of mesh routers with three new systems that bring the wireless protocol to more price segments. </p>
<p> The Wi-Fi Alliance thinks that all that 802.whatever business was becoming too complicated, so get ready for a simpler naming scheme for your favorite wireless standards. For now on, the upcoming 802.11ax standard will be called Wi-Fi 6. The Alliance is also retconning past standards to match the new naming approach. </p>

<p> Google's long-term plans for its MVNO carrier, Project Fi, remain uncertain. But for the time being, the carrier is continuing to roll out new software features. No, Fi isn't getting RCS support — but it is starting to test an always-on VPN service and improved network switching. </p>
<p> We've heard a number of rumors about Google launching its own Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO), codenamed Nova. According to reports, the service will source wireless service from Sprint and T-Mobile, but it will rely on Wi-Fi networks to bear most of the weight of both data and voice services (though VoIP). While the details of this plan still aren't clear, another piece of the puzzle just emerged that indicates Google is going to offer its own virtual private network (VPN) service, and it may be targeted specifically at Nova subscribers. </p>
<p> This information resulted from a tip we received a few days ago, pointing us in the direction of a new application called Google Connectivity Services. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/wi-fi-calling/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485160" filename="wi-fi-calling">
<p> wi-fi calling </p>
<p> If you use Google Voice, but are still able to catch most of your calls with your primary device, you may have encountered some funny behavior where they either pop up quickly, then disappear, and then either ring the phone again or move onto their other linked devices. The company has acknowledged the problem and, unfortunately, says it'll be sticking around for a while. Here's what you can do to get around it. </p>
<p> Even after a major rebranding last year that made most Android devices compatible with Google Fi, users have to choose either a Google phone or a specially adapted one from the likes of Motorola to get the full Fi experience. That's because "designed for Fi" phones have unique modem and firmware tailored for the company's MVNO network to enable special features like automatic networking switching. Today's announcement from the Google Fi team, however, should make non-Google phone owners feel less left out, as the company is rolling out some hitherto Fi-only features to more Android devices, such as spam call warnings, Wi-Fi calling, and VPN protection. </p>
<p> With all the recent issues cropping up on the Pixel 3 and 3 XL, it's probably about time for some good news, right? As it turns out, the Pixel 3 on AT&T has access to network features most other unlocked phones don't — including Wi-Fi calling, HD voice, and creating a hotspot. </p>
<p> It's always been hard to explain what Google Voice is because it feels like a VoIP service, but it's not. Google Voice has operated as a phonecall relay system all these years, forwarding your calls through another number. Earlier this year, Google started beta testing Wi-Fi calls in Google Voice, and it looks like the feature is rolling out to more users. </p>
<p> For mobile users juggling a bunch of different devices, Google Voice can be something of a godsend. Not only does it let you share a single point of contact through which people can reach you no matter which phone or tablet you're carrying at the moment, but it does so without requiring the party on the other end to install a specific app — everything travels over regular voice calls and text messages. </p>
<p> With the launch of Google's Pixel devices, consumers have to make the choice to buy from Verizon, the Google Store, or Project Fi. Unlocked phones sold outside the carrier sometimes don't work with carrier-specific features, like Wi-Fi calling. Thankfully, both Verizon and Google have confirmed to Android Police that all Pixel phones will work with Wi-Fi calling and HD voice on Verizon. </p>
<p> Google's statement says that even Pixel phones purchased through Project Fi will work fine with those features. This essentially means there is no reason to buy a Pixel phone through Verizon, as they will work identically. Buying the Pixel from them actually has some downsides, namely the locked bootloader. </p>
<p> Far be it from humble Android bloggers to tell a multi-billion-dollar telecom corporation what to do with its nigh-infinite resources. But when you're rolling out something that your competitors have offered for some time, it's usually prudent to make it available to as many people as possible. That doesn't seem to be the case for AT&T's Wi-Fi calling feature. The first phone to get it is the Galaxy S7... no, wait, sorry, I made a mistake. That's the choice that would make sense. The first phone to get AT&T Wi-Fi calling is the LG G4. </p>
<p> Last year Verizon Wireless launched Advanced Calling, a VoLTE service with video calling support on select phones. Now the carrier is pushing Advanced Calling 2.0. An over-the-air update is on its way to the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. </p>
<p> T-Mobile users with the latest devices (and sometimes with the latest software updates) appreciate the inclusion of Wi-Fi calling for those areas where the network doesn't reach or can't penetrate indoors. Of course, the fact that Wi-Fi calling is available is a good reason to abstain from flashing custom ROMs, even on multi-carrier devices like the latest batch of Nexus phones. Apparently that won't be a problem for much longer, at least if you're a fan of the CyanogenMod ROM. </p>
<p> Cyanogen Inc. employee (and former leader of the AOKP ROM team) Roman Birg posted the screenshot above to Google+, clearly showing T-Mobile Wi-Fi calling on an AOSP-style software build. </p>
<p> Vodafone UK announced its own Wi-Fi Calling service earlier this month, but support remains extremely limited. As of right now, the only devices listed are the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Fortunately that's about to change, though not by much. Android compatibility is coming in the form of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. </p>

<p> wifi calling </p>
<p> We live in an era when phones often support a dozen or more LTE bands, making them functional on virtually all carriers. Simply working on a carrier might not be enough anymore. There are advanced network technologies like VoLTE and WiFi calling that require device makers and carriers to collaborate to test and certify phones. The GMSA has taken note of this clunky process, and is now working with its partners to develop an open standard for delivering carrier features to more phones. </p>
<p> If you're not a Sprint customer who's in-tune with all the carrier's quirks and features, you probably haven't heard of Calling PLUS. After all, only three phones currently support it - that is, until now. The LG G6 has become the fourth Sprint phone to support Calling PLUS with this latest update. </p>
<p> VoLTE and WiFi calling are both features that have existed on multiple carriers for some years now, but until now, Sprint devices haven't been able to use them in conjunction with each other, save for two rather unimportant devices. The latest updates for the Sprint Galaxy S8 and S8+ enable Calling PLUS, Sprint's lingo for its VoLTE - WiFi calling combo. </p>
<p> With the launch of Google's Pixel devices, consumers have to make the choice to buy from Verizon, the Google Store, or Project Fi. Unlocked phones sold outside the carrier sometimes don't work with carrier-specific features, like Wi-Fi calling. Thankfully, both Verizon and Google have confirmed to Android Police that all Pixel phones will work with Wi-Fi calling and HD voice on Verizon. </p>
<p> Google's statement says that even Pixel phones purchased through Project Fi will work fine with those features. This essentially means there is no reason to buy a Pixel phone through Verizon, as they will work identically. Buying the Pixel from them actually has some downsides, namely the locked bootloader. </p>
<p> In recent years, WiFi calling has become increasingly prevalent on various carriers and devices; the recently-announced Pixel and Pixel XL back up this fact. Google has confirmed that the Pixel smartphones will support WiFi calling for both T-Mobile and Verizon upon launch. </p>
<p> The Verizon-exclusive Droid Turbo 2 was released almost a year ago, and promptly made headlines with claims of a shatterproof screen. Verizon and Motrola have at least made an effort to keep the device updated, compared to other devices on Big Red, and it even received Android 6.0 Marshmallow earlier this year. Now owners of the Turbo 2 can finally use WiFi calling, courtesy of a software update. </p>
<p> An update, titled '24.31.22.kinzie_verizon.verizon.en.US,' is being pushed to all Droid Turbo 2 devices with the "Latest Android™ security updates and bug fixes," as well as full WiFi calling support. </p>
<p> AT&T and Samsung are both notoriously bad with Android updates, but they've done a good job with this latest update for the Galaxy Note5 and the Galaxy S6 edge+. Not only does this update bring the latest security update, but it also adds support for AT&T WiFi calling and Advanced Messaging. </p>
<p> Nearly a year after Android 6.0 Marshmallow first debuted on the Nexus 5X and 6P, the AT&T models of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and Note Edge are finally receiving an OTA for 6.0.1. Samsung has never been reputable for fast updates, and neither has AT&T. This incredibly late update is what happens when you mash the two together. </p>
<p> With the almost limitless number of Android devices on the market, the amount supporting WiFi Calling on AT&T is somewhat limited. The first Android device that AT&T allowed into the WiFi calling club was the LG G4, even after the LG G5 had been available on the network for some time. </p>
<p> Aside from the G4, the only other supported devices were various iPhone models, a few recent Samsung flagships, and two other LG phones. Now the LG V10 is joining that list, with a software update pushing out to owners with the new feature. </p>
<p> The update, with a build number of MRA58K, apparently only includes the addition of WiFi calling; sorry if you got your hopes up for a Nougat update. </p>
<p> AT&T started rolling out WiFi calling to some of its devices a few months ago, starting mysteriously with the LG G4. The GS6 Active and LG K10 followed that, but now a pair of newer flagship phones finally have it too. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are getting WiFi calling in the latest OTA. </p>

<p> wifi-only </p>
<p> While we reported earlier today that Motorola Xooms would be receiving Android 3.2 "in small batches," the update is available now for those of you who have the wifi-only model. The update brings long-awaited features like app zooming and support for SD cards. </p>
<p> Users from the XDA forums have found a way to get that update without having to rely on carrier distribution, which is detailed below. It involves the Xoom Wifi Android 3.2 update, flashing ClockworkMod Recovery for the Motorola Xoom, configuring the Android SDK for your computer, and having adb functioning properly. </p>
<p> Although not yet officially announced by Dell, Amazon has made the Wi-Fi-only version of the Dell Streak 7 tablet available for pre-order on its website for $379.99. </p>
<p> The 4G version of Dell's latest tablet went on sale over a month ago, however its unsubsidized price on Amazon is $449.99. So, the sub-$400 price tag of the WiFi version of this tablet may be an attractive proposition for first time tablet purchasers looking to get their feet wet. </p>
<p> Now that we know that the Wi-Fi-only model of the Motorola XOOM is just around the corner (launching March 27 to be exact) perhaps you are looking for the best deal on the tablet. Costco's website may be the place to look, as they are offering not only a $10 discount (from the listed $600 price tag) but they are also throwing in a free gel case and shipping it to you for free. </p>
<p> It's another day, and we have yet another bit of news about the Wi-Fi-only Motorola XOOM. Only, this time, the news is nothing less than concrete and final, as Moto themselves announced that the carrier-free version of the the 10.1" beauty will be hitting store shelves on March 27 for $599. </p>
<p> The manufacturer lists the retailers who are lined up to carry the slate later this month, including: </p>
<p> RadioShack </p>
<p> While they tell us it will have a $599 price tag, we would recommend keeping an eye on Costco and Sam's Club (if you have a membership already), as they generally sell their goods at lower prices than other retailers. </p>
<p> Take it as you wish, but a flyer that (according to Droid Life) was passed out by Samsung representatives at a technology fair today clearly shows that a Wifi-only version of the original 7" Galaxy Tab is set to hit store shelves on April 4 at $399. </p>
<p> If this turns out to be legit, it may be viewed as a mixed bag by Android users. On the one hand, it's a quality tablet from a major manufacturer offered for $100 less than the iPad, but on the other hand, this isn't November and the original Tab's specs are easily dwarfed by the current generation of Tegra 2 slates that are becoming available. </p>
<p> The latest in a string of rumors about the upcoming Wi-Fi-only version of the Motorola XOOM comes from the team at Droid Life, who say that the carrier-free model may be hitting Staples stores on or around April 3. The same folks are also now reporting another leak from Staples which shows that employees will get the slate in their hands to begin training on March 23. </p>
<p> This dates come from a tip offered up by a Staples insider. </p>
<p> After last week's launch of the 3G (soon to be LTE) Motorola XOOM, many of us began to wonder about that cheaper Wi-Fi-only model that has been promised. We are still (agonizingly) without a confirmed release date, but those sitting on the edges of their seats in anticipation may want to know that the UK version has been priced at £449.99 ($732). </p>
<p> PC World's website announced the arrival and pricing of the much-anticipated slate, also advertising pre-orders (which were not active yet). </p>
<p> Do you love the Motorola XOOM but hate the idea of signing up for yet another contract? Looks like you might just be in luck - according to Maurizio Angelone, Motorola Latin America's General Manager, a WiFi-only version of the XOOM is very real and will, in fact, be launching in April. </p>
<p> Of course, it's always possible that the April timeframe will be exclusive to Argentina, and there's no word on pricing, but we can always hope it'll come to the States along with an iPad-esque $499 asking price. </p>
<p> Remember back when Samsung first introduced us to the Galaxy Tab, the tablet to save us Android fans from the iPad? They promised that a WiFi-only version would eventually come out for those who didn't want to pay for another data plan. </p>
<p> Well today, Samsung finally announced that it will be coming to the US in the first quarter of 2011. No dates have been given for international releases, but since this is a WiFi device, it should be easy to ship it over from the US for international use. </p>

<p> Wikipedia Beta </p>
<p> The Wikipedia mobile app is a great way to access the site's massive wealth of information. The beta program for the Android app, as well as the separate Wikipedia Beta app, has just received a new update that drastically changes the reading list functionality. </p>
<p> Android 6.0 Marshmallow's text selection behavior changed, pushing the toolbar from the top of the screen to a floating one that pops up right above your finger. It also made this popup expandable and accessible to developers, some of which have since updated their apps to take advantage of this new option. First, Google Translate added a system-wide Translate button, making it possible for users to convert any word or sentence they come across into another language. Then Medium built a highlight and respond option inside the toolbar that only got triggered while using its app. Now Wikipedia's beta app has received an update to start searches from anywhere on your device. </p>

<p> As of Sunday, more than 1.6 million acres across 13 states in the west have been burning in wildfires. The worst of them are located in California and Colorado and those areas are where AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon are providing specific responses to their customers. </p>
<p> With wildfires being more prevalent than ever in some parts of the world, it makes sense to improve the quality of information for those in the area. To better crisis response, Google will now show the boundaries of active wildfires via satellite data in near real-time. </p>
<p> If you've placed bets on when HTC will release its last smartphone (at least under its own name) and have marked that date prior to June of this year, you've lost your money. The financially-languishing Taiwanese phone maker still has some gusto left and it may look to continue getting its name out there one way or another. The latest news in its attempts to do so comes from Russia, where regulatory documents have indicated that the company will promote several new smartphones in the near future using a familiar name for longtime HTC fans. </p>
<p> The American Red Cross has been releasing a series of apps to help people deal with disasters. We've already seen apps dedicated to hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as one for first aid. The fourth app in the series just hit he Play Store, and this one's designed to keep people safe during a wildfire. </p>
<p> Much like the Hurricane and Earthquake apps, Wildfires can alert users of nearby fires and offer quick ways to stay safe: </p>
<p> Features Step-by-step instructions let you know what to do even before/during/after an wildfire, even if no data connectivity. • Get notified about current wildfires or wildfire-conducive weather. </p>
<p> Those following HTC's efforts to liberate bootloaders everywhere have a bit more to talk about tonight, as the Taiwanese manufacturer added support for a handful of devices. </p>
<p> For those not in the loop, HTC pledged to enable unlocking the bootloaders of all devices released after September 2011, but is doing the community one better by extending support to older models as well. HTC allows users to unlock their bootloaders using a quick, (relatively) easy online tool. </p>
<p> Among the newly unlockable devices are the original Desire, the Desire HD, Wildfire, and Wildfire S. To get started, just head over to HTC's Bootloader Unlock page. </p>
<p> Ever since the beginning of June, we've been teased by and patiently waiting for the mysterious AlphaRevX unlocker page that promised to completely unlock (S-OFF) the latest HTC Wildfire and even Incredible S, making root, custom ROMs, ClockworkMod recovery all possible. </p>
<p> After a period of private beta testing, the wraps have come off an hour ago, and the first public release of AlphaRevX is now available for download (see instructions below) for the following devices: </p>
<p> Incredible 2 and Desire S are not supported at the moment, though I suspect they use a similar protection scheme and will also be cracked shortly. </p>
<p> CyanogenMod 7 has earned its reputation as the most reliable Gingerbread ROM, even though it hasn't yet entered stable mode. And tonight, the fun goes on - RC4 RC3.14159265358979323846264338327, as the CM team so lovingly refers to it, has just been launched for all supported CM devices. </p>
<p> While RC4 doesn't contain any ground-breaking new features, it does bring a number of bug fixes - for example, hardware acceleration has been added to the Nook Color, and EGL has seen a big fix. It isn't perfect yet - kmobs notes that there may be some "lingering GPS issues on the EVO and the N1 call audio bug hasn't been fully fixed" - but it's still worth the update. </p>
<p> While the owners of HTC Wildfires have known for a while now that their devices would be eventually receiving Froyo, and that it probably wouldn't happen until Christmas, they were still secretly hoping HTC wouldn't take over 6 months to accomplish the feat. At least it looks like the company is keeping its word, which is refreshing nowadays, to say the least. </p>
<p> Starting this week, HTC will be rolling out Froyo to European Wildfire variants, with the rest of the world following sometime between now and February 2011. Better late than never, I suppose, although by then, we could be seeing Honeycomb and forgetting all about Froyo, let alone Gingerbread. </p>
<p> Today is obviously the day for popular applications to add QVGA support. As Rovio did only hours ago, Skype have added support for the increasingly-common 320x240 resolution in their application. That's good news for owners of the HTC Wildfire, Motorola Charm, Huawei IDEOS and LG Optimus T/S, who were left out in the cold until now. Skype for Android has had some nice bug fixes and improvements added, too: </p>
<p> Improvements: </p>
<p> 320*240 and 240*400 screen resolutions are now supported. </p>
<p> While the UK has had the Desire HD since early last week, the EVO look-a-like model and its sibling are only starting to trickle into Irish stores. Currently Vodafone appears to be the only carrier offering one of the new Desires, with the Desire HD available on pre-pay for €479 or €229 on an 18 month €35 contract. However, many Irish Android users appear to be holding out for their network of choice, Meteor, to announce the Desire HD and to a lesser extent the Desire Z. </p>
<p> Today Meteor released a press statement indicating that an end to that torturous wait is coming, although perhaps not as soon as hoped. </p>

<p> Wink recently caused an uproar when it launched a mandatory subscription plan out of nowhere, hindering anyone unwilling to pay from controlling their smart home hubs after a meager 14-day heads-up. The troubled company since backtracked and gave an indefinite extension of its free service, but of course, the business still wants to tap into a recurring income stream. It has announced that the $4.99-a-month subscription will become mandatory starting July 27, though this time around, free users will be able to retain some extremely limited functionality — if you even want to call it that. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/07 7:00am PDTon May 7, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/22 1:30am PDTon May 22, 2020. </p>
<p> Earlier this May, Wink announced out of the blue that it would charge customers $4.99 a month to continue using its services, or else their hardware would stop working. Following understandable customer backlash, the company first extended the cut-off deadline by a week, and has now indefinitely back-paddled, saying that it'll look for a new start date of the subscription. </p>
<p> Wink is a name that's decently well-known in the smart home space. Previously owned by the ill-fated Quirky, the home automation company got pawned off to Flextronics. Now, Wink will be joining i.am+, the firm founded by entertainer will.i.am. The sum of the acquisition is unknown right now, however, i.am+'s PR has confirmed the purchase. </p>

<p> The low-cost Sprint MVNO FreedomPop just launched its freemium phone service last month, but now it's expanding phone selection by letting users bring their own handsets. However, that doesn't mean you can take just any Sprint device over the FreedomPop and kiss your bill goodbye – there are some restrictions. </p>
<p> Spending too much on your phone service? You could maybe cut that bill down a bit, if you're willing to make a few sacrifices. How does free sound? FreedomPop, which previously started offering free mobile and home internet access, is expanding into phone service. For $0 per month, you can get 200 voice minutes, 500 texts, and 500MB of 3G/4G data. </p>
<p> This is obviously not a plan for heavy data users, but 500 MB might be workable if you're on WiFi most of the day. </p>
<p> In a post to the Android Building group earlier today, Jean-Baptiste Queru announced that Samsung's Nexus S 4G has officially and fully been brought into the AOSP fold. The device is now fully supported by AOSP, meaning its CDMA – and WiMax – binaries can now be "properly" distributed. Here's the full text of the announcement: </p>
<p> We've been able to resolve the issues around Nexus S 4G, and we can now properly distribute its CDMA and WiMAX binaries. </p>
<p> Sprint has long been the refuge for data-hungry users that don't want to deal with caps or overages. While Sprint's regular 3G and 4G data usage on phones is still unlimited, back in October the Now Network started capping the mobile hotspot feature at 5GB per month. Starting last Friday, May 18th, that plan is gone. In its place are two pricier options. </p>
<p> The low-end option comes with 2GB of monthly bandwidth and costs $19.99 per month. </p>
<p> If you've been looking to jump ship from the carrier juggernauts and get in on Sprint's promised "truly unlimited data", may we suggest now might be a good time to do so? From now until March 26th, all of Sprint's 4G phones (read: Sprint's best phones) are available for a penny with a new activation. Sorry upgraders. </p>
<p> Update 4/20/12: All Sprint Android phones are free again thanks to the Sprint Through Spring promotion... </p>
<p> It's only been a couple years since the EVO launched as not only the first WiMax phone, but the first "4G" phone (by carrier reckoning). Now, though, Sprint says that not only will there be no more WiMax phones, which we knew earlier, but no more WiMax devices at all. That means hotspots and tablets will also lack any WiMax antennae. Don't worry, though. Sprint has promised 15 LTE devices by year's end. </p>
<p> Sprint posted its fourth quarter earnings this morning, and they definitely painted a mixed picture of the company's financial position. On the one hand, the Alamo of unlimited data increased its subscriber base by 1.6 million in the last quarter, with big thanks likely owed to the addition of the iPhone to Sprint's lineup - giving them a significant advantage over their primary price point rival, T-Mobile. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, also because of the iPhone, the company managed a $1.3 billion net loss for the quarter, owed in large part to the massive cost of providing the device ($15.5 billion over 4 years) to customers at heavily subsidized price points. </p>
<p> It would appear that Sprint plans on going full speed ahead in focusing on product development for its 4G LTE lineup this year. David Owens, Sprint's VP of Product Development made clear at CES Wednesday that Sprint "won't be introducing any more WiMax smartphones," adding "April, May, June, July, August, those will be very aggressive times for us." This may be a hint that we could begin seeing LTE devices as early as April, which is great news for customers holding out for a new device (like Samsung's Galaxy Nexus, which is poised to be Sprint's first LTE device). </p>
<p> Update: Dow Jones Newswires apparently left out a key piece of information from Hesse's statement on throttling, in an example of truly stellar journalism and attention to detail (unfortunately, we have no audio or video record to verify Hesse's statements). Hesse was discussing throttling of those who are on networks that Sprint has roaming agreements with (which, admittedly, Sprint has a lot of - including with Verizon). While this still makes Sprint's ads technically misleading, the throttling really only applies to those who live in areas where Sprint's data network relies chiefly on roaming - not to those using primarily Sprint towers. </p>
<p> And so it begins - Android Police's First Annual Mega-Holiday Giveaway Series. For the next ten days, you'll have chances to win all sorts of awesome Android phones, tablets, and other goodies. (As a note to our international readers, this first contest features prizes that don't work outside the US, but don't worry, we have some more stuff coming for you later today.) </p>
<p> This contest is now over. Here are our winners, selected at random: </p>

<p> Remember when Google used to make its Android Easter eggs fun? My personal favorite is the Flappy Bird knockoff that was in Lollipop. If you, too, are a fan of Google's simple little Easter egg games, you may want to take a look at what it's drawn up for Wimbledon — a pixelated little tennis game. </p>
<p> For those looking forward to 2012's playing of what is widely considered the oldest (and most well-known) tennis tournament in existence, the official Wimbledon app hit the Play Store recently, bringing live scores, results, schedules, and more. </p>
<p> The app, despite its somewhat all-over-the-place UI, provides a ton of functionality, not only giving users information about the games, but also about players – Wimbledon's official app gives users player profiles, video previews, highlight reels, features, interviews and "golden moments" photos. If that isn't enough, players can tune in to three "Live @ Wimbledon" radio channels – one providing general "Daily Coverage" and two channels dedicated to Centre Court and No. </p>

<p> winamp </p>
<p> The internet got all sad and nostalgic in November when AOL announced with little fanfare that Winamp was shutting down. The music player and streaming service had been whipping llamas for 15 years, and it seemed like a depressing and inauspicious end. AOL smartly held off on the shutdown when there appeared to be interest in buying Winamp, and that's just what happened. Winamp is being sold to Belgian online radio purveyor Radionomy. </p>
<p> Winamp has been around since 1997, and though it has amassed a large and faithful following in the years since, the good times are coming to an end. The software will cease to be available come December 20th. Anyone who visits the download page is now greeted by a message warning that they better grab the goods while they're still available, because they won't be a month from now. </p>
<p> The page doesn't explicitly mention the Android version, and there isn't yet a warning on either the Play Store or the app's website. </p>
<p> The variety of software that I've had installed on my different Windows computers over the past decade and a half has changed dramatically throughout time. However, there is one piece of software that I have had on every PC I've ever owned: Winamp. I first used Winamp at version 1, and have just stuck with it ever since; no matter how many other media players I tried, I always went back to Winamp. </p>
<p> Nullsoft, creator of WinAmp, a favorite media player for over 10 million Android users, is adding its premium track directly to the Android Market. Users have previously been able to download the Pro version via an in-app purchase, but now the Pro license is also available directly from the Android Market. So, what do you get for your $5? Here's a look at the feature list: </p>
<p> Customizable home screen </p>
<p> Browse by Folder </p>
<p> Crossfade </p>
<p> In what seems to be its biggest update since the initial release, the Winamp team just pushed some pretty major changes to Winamp for Android. For starters, this update now allows Mac users to sync with Winamp -- something that has previously been missing. Aside from that, there is now a pro version available, offering enough new features to easily justify the $5 pricetag: </p>
<p> 10-band graphic equalizer </p>
<p> A customizable home screen </p>
<p> The ability to navigate or browse your music by Folders </p>
<p> Crossfade between tracks </p>
<p> Gapless playback </p>
<p> Support for FLAC playback in Browse by Folders nav (lossless audio playback) </p>
<p> Replay Gain Support (configurable in Settings menu) </p>
<p> Personalized SHOUTcast station recommendations (based on music in your Android device) </p>
<p> The ability to play any streaming audio URL in SHOUTcast (supported formats only) </p>
<p> Ad Free </p>
<p> The update is available now in the Android Market -- hit the widget to grab it. </p>
<p> Listening to tunes on your Android device is serious business - no doubt about it. </p>
<p> It's so serious that many of us are pretty well set in our ways for what we consider the "choice" Android music-listening application, and we aren't willing to budge on it. </p>
<p> PowerAMP users, for example, swear by the application's seemingly endless list of customizations and options. On the other hand, Subsonic devotees like myself are advocates of what is probably the most configurable music streaming experience in existence. </p>
<p> Winamp feels incomplete without Shoutcast radio streaming support, and 2 weeks ago, some folks at DownloadSquad got their hands on a private beta version that had just that. Fast forward to today, and you can finally download the new Shoutcast-enabled v0.9.2 from the Market. </p>
<p> Top stations, search, favorites, recent, and genre browsing are all there and work exactly as expected. Now if only we could play custom .pls playlists, such as the one di.fm </p>
<p> Winamp, one of my favorite desktop music players, recently landed in the Android Market, and has since become one of my favorite mobile players as well, at least until PowerAMP came along. One glaring omission, however, has been the absence of Shoutcast streaming, meaning thousands of online radio stations (such as DI.fm) that are easily accessible via the desktop version, weren't available on mobile. I don't like having to use a whole different app just for radio, but, alas, I had to resort to using TuneWiki or XiiaLive, neither of which I was a fan of. </p>
<p> There is no shortage of media applications for Android - in fact, Winamp that came out last week was the most serious and robust media offering I've seen so far. However, when it comes to strictly the media player functionality, even Winamp can't touch what I'm about to show you - a new beta app called PowerAMP. </p>
<p> PowerAMP is an Android media player developed by a cool Russian dude by the name of Maxim Petrov (Max MP). </p>
<p> Have I gotten a treat for you music lovers? Winamp, the very first good music player for Windows - and one I still use religiously to this day - hit the Android Marketplace today, largely unnoticed in the Androidosphere. </p>
<p> It's still in Beta, but after using it for 15 minutes, I was so impressed that I set it as my default player and uninstalled the others. Let me tell you why, in the order of importance. </p>

<p> Wink Lookout </p>
<p> If you're interested in a new security kit for your home or a way to get started setting up a smart home, Wink has a nice offering that's pretty much foolproof for newbies. I reviewed the hub a while ago, and though I moved to SmartThings for its more advanced features, I can still recommend Wink because it makes the basics a lot easier than SmartThings. And Wink's new Lookout takes that one step further by providing sensors and a siren that are pre-paired with the included hub, requiring even less setup. The system may not be as sturdy as other home security offerings from Nest and SmartThings + ADT, but it costs much less and requires no monthly fees. </p>
<p> Following the recent onslaught of home security systems from Nest, SmartThings, and Ring, Wink is throwing its name into the game and announcing Wink Lookout. The Lookout kit will cost $199, which is more in line with Ring's pricing, but it doesn't ask for any monthly subscription fees. That's both a plus and a minus. </p>
<p> But before we get ahead of ourselves, let's look at the kit. It comes with the Wink Hub 2 ($99), two open/close door and window sensors ($29 each), one motion sensor with adjustable sensitivity ($39), and one siren and chime with a built-in ring of LED lights and 10 selectable sounds ($39). </p>

<p> winners </p>
<p> In Late 2014, Google - along with Adidas, Polar, and Withings - opened a Google Fit developer challenge, hoping to get more apps into Google's burgeoning fitness ecosystem. </p>
<p> Today, the winners of that challenge have been announced. The twelve grand prize winners will get special promotion in the Play Store, greatly increasing their visibility to potential users. Additionally, winners (grand prize and runners up) will receive the X_CELL and SPEED_CELL from Adidas, an unspecified "new" Android Wear device, a Loop activity tracker from Polar, and a Smart Body Analyzer from Withings. </p>
<p> Last week, we took a look at the nominees for Ouya's 10-day developer competition, Create. Today, we have the winners! These game devs will receive some undisclosed amount of money (out of a pot of $45,000) and almost certainly end up on the launch version of the Ouya console. So, what are they? Well, let's break them down by category. </p>
<p> "Pop Your Eyes Out" Award: Pipnis </p>
<p> We covered this one in our roundup last week, though we're at a loss to explain how it didn't win the "Best Couch with Friends" Award. </p>
<p> Our inaugural Monthly Home Screen Challenge for the month of October was a great success. So much so that we decided to keep the challenge going, and we got some awesome submissions for November. As always, it was tricky picking a winner, and after much deliberation we finally settled on Hotmann, who came up with an interesting take on the periodic table. </p>
<p> Just like last month's challenge, we have taken the winning submission and broken it down into its basic components for your reading/designing pleasure. </p>
<p> There were a ton of excellent entries for our first Home Screen Challenge, and whittling down all the home screens was no easy task. That's why we've chosen two winners this month - Xal and Austin C, who each showed us their own twist on a visually stimulating, yet practical home screen layout. Our winners will be contacted shortly to claim their AP shirts. </p>
<p> As promised, we've prepared a full overview of each of our winning home screens, highlighting each of their elements so that you too can create a home screen design that is both beautiful and functional. </p>
<p> O'Reilly's Android Open conference, which is happening October 9-11, is our first real media sponsorship of an Android event (yay!), and as media partners, we were given 2 free tickets to the event, along with an exclusive 20% off code: AN11AP. </p>
<p> Since nothing would make us happier than giving away the 2 free tickets we've gotten (worth $1295 each) to the most deserving AP readers, I had Cameron immediately fire up the giveaway last week. </p>
<p> Wow, you guys sure like Android figurines - with almost 1,100 entries, the giveaway post is now our most commented post ever. After letting a whirlwind of randomness and chaos work its magic on the list of entries, I'm now ready to congratulate the following folks who will be getting a free figurine from VinylFigurines.com shipped to their doorsteps: </p>
<p> We've passed your emails to Omar from Vinyl Figurines, so you should be getting some info from him shortly. </p>
<p> Remember our Out of Milk giveaway? Come on, it was like, a few days ago. If you don't, we gave away 25 copies of the Pro version of this absolutely fantastic shopping and pantry organization app to the comments here and on Google+ that we enjoyed the most. Here they are. </p>
<p> When milk is what you need and shopping warnings were not heed Then You, my friend, are out of luck and in the doghouse surely stuck </p>
<p> You need to shop with care and plan your trip with flair </p>
<p> Can’t decipher illegible doodles will end you up buying noodles </p>
<p> Don’t bring home salami knowing everyone eats pastrami </p>
<p> And when all that’s needed is a bit of oats you better not come rolling home with goats </p>
<p> No listed item should be carelessly omitted or for sure you will be deemed nit-witted. </p>
<p> The WakeVoice license giveaway attracted over 600 entries, and after sorting through all of them and picking 20 at random, we're ready to congratulate the following folks and send them free licenses: </p>
<p> We've passed your emails along to WakeVoice, so you should be getting your codes shortly. </p>
<p> Last week, we took the wraps off a new accessory contest sponsored by Seidio, in which five lucky winners will be the recipients of a case and desktop charger of their choosing. </p>
<p> After reading through all 170+ entries - some funny, some tragic, some that make you feel awful for the story teller, and some that were just downright crazy, we've reached a decision on who the winners are. </p>
<p> So, without further ado, here they are (in no particular order): </p>
<p> The Winners </p>
<p> Ryan Duncan </p>
<p> First up is a tragic story of a love almost lost thanks to a dead battery, but fortunately, it has a happy ending. </p>
<p> You may not remember the contest we had last month for the JLabs J4M ruggedized headphones, but I suggest you check the review out - they're a pretty good set of very tough earbuds. We gave away three pairs of J4Ms, courtesy of JLab, as part of the review. And the winners are: </p>
<p> Jason Taylor, from Texas, who entered via Twitter. </p>
<p> Bruce Cheek of Illinois, who entered via Google+. </p>
<p> Keith McCrory of Ireland, who entered via Google+. </p>

<p> OnePlus hyped the Nord up for a long time, so it's a good thing that the phone lives up to expectations. For £379, this is one hell of a phone, but those of us that don't live in European or Indian markets have been left out. We have some good news, though; according to OnePlus cofounder Carl Pei, a Nord phone of some sort will be coming stateside soon. </p>
<p> Chasing like counts on social media and seeking approval from your friends are known to have a toll on your mental health and self-esteem. Instagram took it upon itself to curb such prevailing behavioral ramifications when it began hiding likes from posts for some of its users earlier this year. This change is being tested in seven countries worldwide, and the US will join the list as soon as this week. </p>
<p> While OnePlus fans eagerly await the upcoming announcement for the company's next flagship, early takes continue to trickle out. On the heels of DisplayMate's "A+" grade for the 7 Pro's display, Wired was able to take a look at a pre-production unit's camera performance, revealing a 3x zoom camera. The publication tested the OnePlus 7 Pro's camera at a recent Baku F1 race in Azerbaijan, pulling a handful of (compressed and downscaled) samples. Let's take a look. </p>
<p> OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei recently confirmed that the company's forthcoming 6T won't have a headphone jack. It'll include an adapter in the box, but what kind of self-respecting company would OnePlus be if it didn't also sell you a solution? Enter the Type-C Bullets, a new pair of wired earbuds that'll plug right into the new phone's only remaining port. </p>
<p> It's tough to choose a good security camera nowadays. Hundreds of brands are releasing their own and almost all of them offer a similar featureset. What I look for, personally, is integration with other smart home systems — namely Google Home — and whether or not a monthly fee is required to get the basic features. For those two reasons, the Logi Circle 2 has been on my watchlist for a long time, and its temptation is getting harder to resist with these two discounts. </p>
<p> The Kindle Fire is just about ready to launch, and not since the launch of the Motorola XOOM has an Android tablet been so hotly anticipated. With a little help from the mainstream media, consequent consumer excitement, and - last but certainly not least - Amazon's front page (all things manufacturers like ASUS could only dream of), it has skyrocketed to the top of many tech enthusiasts' holiday shopping lists. And at $199, it won't break the bank, either; the only thing that could possibly hold it back now would be, well, an underwhelming user experience. So has Amazon ironed out the kinks? </p>

<p> wireless android auto </p>
<p> BMW was one of the last automakers to add Android Auto to its vehicles, and owners with compatible cars still have to go to the dealer to get the update. That's changing soon, though; BMW has just announced that an over-the-air update will start rolling out "over the coming weeks." </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/09/05 8:05am PDTon Sep 5, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/08 8:06am PDTon Sep 8, 2020. </p>
<p> While compatibility with wireless Android Auto is expanding on phones, there are still many in-car head units and media players that are stuck using tethered connections. That's where a device called 'AAWireless' comes in, which aims to add wireless support to as many Android Auto units as possible. </p>
<p> Android Auto has traditionally required connecting your phone to a car with a USB cable, but a wireless mode was introduced in 2018 for some Pixel phones. Samsung devices were later added to the compatibility list, and starting with Android 11, every Android phone that supports 5GHz Wi-Fi should be capable of running wireless Android Auto. </p>
<p> Some cars and head units are capable of displaying Android Auto from your phone wirelessly, but there are additional restrictions to the functionality — other than owning a compatible handset, you also need to live in one of the regions where the wireless connection is available. Luckily, the list of supported countries is expanding, and now you can use wireless Android Auto in almost all locations where the wired version is available, with only two exceptions: Japan and Russia. </p>
<p> Android Auto is handy to have in your car, but one of its main caveats is the requirement to have your phone plugged in at all times. Wireless Android Auto aims to solve that problem, and JVC and KENWOOD have collectively announced seven units that support it. KENWOOD's five units, all of which are understandably pretty pricey, are now shipping in the US. </p>
<p> We knew it was coming but it's now official: JVCKENWOOD has debuted 7 new car head units under its JVC and Kenwood brands with support for Wireless Android Auto. This means no more fussing with the USB cable and plugging your phone in every time you get in the car: the Auto interface will work wirelessly. This will be great for short trips, but you're still better off charging your phone during long drives, especially if you're using GPS for navigation, lest the battery die prematurely. </p>
<p> Android Auto makes the in-car experience a lot nicer (at least when it's not bugging out), but it's tedious to have to plug your phone in every time you get in the car just to use it. We've been hoping for a wireless solution for some time now, and it seems like it's finally becoming a reality. JVCKENWOOD will have two receivers capable of wireless Android Auto on display at CES 2018. </p>

<p> wireless charger </p>
<p> Wireless charging is certainly handy, and it's also becoming more widespread. Heck, even OnePlus phones have wireless charging now. Right now, Amazon is offering up a selection of Anker charging solutions for up to 44% off as part of its Deal of the Day — including wireless chargers, wall chargers, and even a power strip. </p>
<p> Looking to pick up a sleek Qi wireless charging pad that can fill your phone up pretty fast? Aukey has one that can bring up to 15W to your phone (depending on model and wall charger) and it's on sale with promo code for more than half off! </p>
<p> Wireless chargers come in several shapes and sizes over the years, from stands to pucks and even orbs, but the mechanics behind how they work can make them kind of a pain. Positioning needs to be just so, or the coil on your gadget won't line up with the coil in the charger, and nothing happens. Multi-coil chargers have been a thing for a while, but the new Zens Liberty steps things up drastically, with sixteen coils stacked and staggered across its face. You can pretty much just dump your phone wherever, and it'll charge. It even looks pretty dang snazzy if you opt for the glass-topped version, but you'll pay €199.99 (around $215 right now) for that privilege. </p>
<p> If you've been spending more time at home lately, you may have started to notice gaps in your home charging setup. Whether you're perfecting your sourdough in the kitchen or improvising a new space to work from home, a well-placed wireless charger is a perfect way to ensure you'll always have a full battery. Right now, you can grab a two-pack of Anker's PowerWave wireless charging stands for only $25.49 at Amazon, saving yourself $7.50 off the MSRP. </p>
<p> After months of hype and more than a few leaks, OnePlus finally unveiled its latest smartphones at a live-streamed online-only event today. The OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro are the company’s most advanced ever phones, with the Pro model introducing a couple of long-awaited features in wireless charging and an IP rating. </p>
<p> Logitech probably isn't the first name that comes to mind when it comes to charging accessories, though the company has dabbled with wireless docks in the past. Today Logitech announced its new series of 'POWERED' charging accessories, but they're a bit pricey. </p>
<p> Do you happen to own a car without Android Auto support? Or maybe just a car without a great place to put your phone? Thankfully, there are plenty of third-party retailers ready to help solve that particular problem with a variety of mounts and cradles. If you happen to be looking for a new or upgraded phone holder for your car, you can save up to $14 on select phone mounts and home wireless chargers from iOttie during Amazon's latest deal of the day. </p>
<p> Wireless chargers are pretty great, especially when they don't cost a lot of money. Right now, you can get Anker's PowerWave wireless charging stand for just $11.99 from Newegg. That's $7 cheaper than the current Amazon price. </p>
<p> It's finally here! After all the speculation, photo leaks, and contradicting details surrounding its revolutionary camera system, the brand new Samsung Galaxy S20 series has arrived. To keep your new phone safe while also looking great, Spigen has a new case lineup for Samsung Galaxy S20, S20 Plus, and S20 Ultra, with styles ranging from a bold matte black, to simple and crystal clear, and even your favorites that pack the most protection. </p>
<p> Hey there! The dust hasn't even settled from the deals roundup we brought to you earlier this week, and we've already pulled together a fresh batch of goods that are ripe for the taking. Today, we're featuring discounts on Bose headphones, Amazon Echo Dot 3rd gen, additional Pixel 4 offers, and more. Check it out! </p>

<p> Whether you're tired of fumbling with wires to charge your favorite smartphone, or you've already converted to wireless power and you're in need of more charging pads, you're going to want to take a look at this affordable option from Anker. Available now through the end of this month, Amazon Prime members can snatch up an Anker PowerPort Wireless 5 Pad for just $7.99 ($10 off) with promo code. </p>
<p> This isn't a drill. Christmas is only five days away, and you're in need of some last-minute stocking stuffers to round out your holiday haul. It just so happens that the Anker PowerWave Pad wireless charging system has just dropped to an all-time low of only $9.59 ($2.40) on Amazon. If you order it now, it can even arrive before Christmas day. </p>
<p> Mobile accessory maker (and maker of other things like mini projectors) Anker has a boatload of products on sale right now on Amazon and its flash deal site, Woot. You can save a whole bunch on car chargers, wireless chargers, Bluetooth speakers, AA batteries, and so much more. But where should you go to save the most? </p>
<p> It's the week before Thanksgiving and you're probably about to head off to the relatives or to a friend's apartment to share in a meal, some laughs, and maybe a good dose of anxiety. One source of anxiety you'd want to nip right from the bud is power sourcing — you've got gadgets, after all. Fortunately, Anker has a few good deals running today only on Amazon to satisfy your needs. </p>
<p> If you are looking for a reliable way to wirelessly charge your phone or keep some extra juice tucked away in a pocket when away from home, then look no further than BESTEK's Wireless Charging Pad and Power Bank. Not only does this combination of products ensure that you'll never have to worry about your phone running out of power at home or on the go, but you can snag them both from BESTEK Mall for 60% off their retail price while supplies last. </p>
<p> The era of ubiquitous wireless charging isn't quite upon us. With metal bodies blocking the connection and fast charging reducing how much time we spend tethered to a wall, most of us don't expect to see all that many people (even those with high-end devices) dropping their phones on pads </p>
<p> This isn't really so much news as "I thought this was kind of cool and wanted to share it with all of you." I just received an evaluation unit of Samsung's new wireless fast charge pad for the Galaxy S6 edge+ and Note 5, and upon opening I noticed immediately that it was quite a bit thicker than Samsung's old Galaxy S6 wireless charging pad. I then spied an array of what looked like (and as it turns out, are) ventilation openings all along the bottom of the charging puck. Could it be? Did Samsung build a phone charger with a fan inside it? </p>

<p> If you're in the market for a new smartphone, Verizon's pixel-packing Droid DNA is hard to beat. It offers a whopping 440PPI in its 5" 1920x1080 display, along with a quad-core Qualcomm S4 Pro and 2GB of RAM under the hood. Top all that off with Android 4.1.1, and you have an absolute monster of a phone. </p>
<p> But if you want to get all that and save a bit of cash, Wirefly has your number So long as you're willing to sign a new two-year agreement with Verizon right now, you can grab the DNA for $50. </p>
<p> So, you want to jump over to Sprint, but don't need the fastest device on the planet? Both Amazon Wireless and Wirefly have a good deal going on the just released EVO Design 4G by HTC: $50. Update: It's still $50 at Wirefly, but Amazon Wireless just dropped the price to $30. Of course, this requires a new two-year contract, so all current Sprintsters will be stuck paying $80, which still saves about $20 over the in-store price. </p>

<p> withings body cardio </p>
<p> When I reviewed the Withings Body Cardio scale just this past Saturday, I came away impressed by most things it could do, but rather let down by its price. At $179.95, I didn't think there were enough reasons to get the Body Cardio instead of the regular Body scale, which cost $129.95. I found the heart rate monitoring rather pointless while standing up and the Pulse Wave Velocity measure an interesting feature but with limited usefulness and accuracy. </p>
<p> My last sentences of the post were, and I quote, "Withings smart scales do drop their prices sometimes, so if you happen to find the Body Cardio around the same price as the regular Body, go for it. </p>
<p> My arsenal of smart health and activity trackers has been missing a body composition weight scale. The Fitbit Aria always looked appealing to me because I've been wearing a Fitbit for more than 3 years, but it's getting a little outdated. Several months ago, I was looking at the Polar Balance Scale, the Withings WS-50, the Garmin Index Smart Scale, and a few others. Eventually, I settled on the QardioBase because I already had a good experience with the QardioArm and liked the company's no-nonsense approach to design and health. However, I was unlucky enough to get the first generation, which turned out to be a complete failure from the get-go. </p>

<p> wonderboom </p>
<p> Sometimes, the best places to sit back and kick up the music are also a bit perilous for fragile electronics. Whether you're heading to the beach, hiking a nearby trail, or taking a float trip downstream, you're going to need a rugged Bluetooth speaker that can withstand the journey ahead. The Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 2 for just $69.99 ($30 off) on Amazon and other retailers was built to endure all of these challenging environments and more. </p>
<p> The sheer abundance of Bluetooth speakers on the market can be overwhelming, but a few brands have managed to rise to prominence — Ultimate Ears, better known as UE, being one of them. Over-sized volume controls and an emphasis on cylindrical designs have helped the brand achieve recognizability in a crowded category. Today, both Amazon and Best Buy have the first-generation UE Wonderboom available for as little as $40. </p>
<p> A couple years back, Ultimate Ears released the Wonderboom, a squat little speaker that delivered great sound at a good price. With some attractive color pairings, and big, easy-to-use controls, there was a lot to like about the speaker, though there was also clearly still room to grow. Now UE’s ready with its follow-up, launching the Wonderboom 2 earlier this summer. </p>
<p> The original Ultimate Ears Wonderboom was a tiny and cute little portable Bluetooth speaker that could float on water and sounded pretty decent — all for just $100. There was little not to love about it, a sentiment echoed by Jeff in our review. It must have been a good seller for UE owner Logitech, too, as it's seen fit to bring out an updated version with better sound and more features. </p>
<p> Bluetooth speakers are usually a good idea for gift giving, and UE's offerings are often a strong bet. The Wonderboom is currently on sale for $69.99. Costco has a two-pack for $109.99, making each speaker $55. Either way, you get $30 off the full price. </p>

<p> The Moto X has been making headlines as of late for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is the astoundingly versatile Motomaker. Motomaker lets you to customize your phone to a degree that we've never seen before, allowing for a staggering total of 504 unique color combinations. Don't gasp in amazement at that number just yet, though. It looks like Motorola is preparing Motomaker to include the wooden backs we saw last month at the phone's unveiling. </p>
<p> Arcade cabinet mods are certainly nothing new. Ever since the kids of the late 70s and early 80s grew up into the adults of the late 90s and early aughts, the internet has been filled with folks building wooden boxes around computers and joysticks. Today's example, though, uses an Android tablet and a Tatsunoko vs. Capcom fight stick for what might be one of the cheapest, easiest-to-replicate Arcade cabinets around. </p>

<p> Samsung's bean-shaped Galaxy Buds Live were only released a couple months ago, but we're already starting to see decent sales. Now you can get the earbuds for as low as $135 from Amazon-owned Woot, a discount of $35 from the typical price. </p>
<p> Google may have given up on tablets, but Amazon is still holding on for dear life. The company's Fire tablets have always been about providing value to customers for low price points, and right now Woot is offering some of the lowest prices around on older generation Fire tablets — including the 2018 Fire HD 8 for just $49.99. </p>

<p> JBL produces dozens of speakers and other audio products designed for outdoor/water use. One of them is the JBL Charge 4 speaker, which is a bit old at this point, but is still an excellent portable Bluetooth speaker. Now you can get it from Woot for just $89.99, and other JBL audio products are on sale too. </p>
<p> We'd like to think Mother Nature can take care of our lawns just fine on her own, but unfortunately, that's not true in most locations. Luckily, you can be your own Mother Nature with the Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller. Once connected to your existing setup, you'll be able to schedule waterings optimized for your lawn that help save water and money. Today on Woot, you can grab a factory reconditioned 2nd generation unit for just $79.99. </p>
<p> The OnePlus 7T has been discounted to $399.99 several times in the past couple of months, and the same deal is back again if you missed out on it previously. The 7T may no longer be the newest OnePlus phone, but it offers a ton of bang for the buck at this price point. </p>
<p> Android 11 is here, and we're sure you want to try it out — the only issue is it being limited to the Pixel series and a few beta releases right now. What if you don't have one of those? Well, if the Pixel 4a is still out of your price range, or you're looking for a phone with a bigger screen, you're in luck: Woot has the Pixel 3a XL on sale for just $300. </p>
<p> The fall semester's starting up, and with many schools opting for remote learning, Chromebooks are hotter than ever. Unfortunately, that means that most are out of stock. If you're fine with a refurbished unit, Woot is offering some higher-end Chromebooks right now for decent prices. </p>
<p> If you missed out on the Galaxy Buds+ deal from around a week ago, you're in luck. Woot is currently offering the same (well, technically a dollar pricier) deal: the Buds+ for $99.99. If you're an Amazon Prime member, you get free shipping as well. </p>

<p> The original Google Wifi system was first released in late 2016, and even though it has been replaced by the slightly-better Nest Wifi, the first-gen system is still an upgrade over many mesh networks available today. Today, Woot is selling both the single and 3-pack models at some of the lowest prices we've seen yet. </p>

<p> Once upon a time, you could view and edit Google Docs files from a single Drive app, but Google later split them up into multiple editing applications. Microsoft is now doing the reverse: it's combining the Android versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into one app to rule them all. </p>
<p> Microsoft has been testing a new Office mobile app for Android since this spring, which combines Microsoft's mobile variants of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into one. The relatively new app gives you a convenient, cloud-synchronized central point for Microsoft Office document creation and management, plus scanning, notes, and more. It's an all-in-one, on-the-go Microsoft Office solution, and now it's available in public preview. </p>
<p> Even though cloud-based productivity suites like Google Docs are incredibly popular, many people (and large corporations) still operate on good ol' Microsoft Office. The Word text processor was Microsoft's first Android app to pass 500 million installs on the Play Store, and a little over a year later, it has now passed the 1 billion mark. </p>
<p> Cloud-based services like Google Docs have replaced old-fashioned word processors for some of us, but plenty of people still want to open Microsoft Word files. So many, in fact, that Microsoft Word for Android has hit the 500 million install milestone in the Play Store. That's the first app published by Microsoft (not counting Skype) to reach that number. </p>
<p> For years, one of the most common complaints about Chromebooks was that they couldn't run the Office suite of applications. Microsoft has offered Android apps for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for a few years now, but they weren't made available to all Chromebooks for some reason. </p>
<p> After Google improved the Docs, Sheets, and Slides apps a few weeks ago, Microsoft is responding with updates to the Android apps for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The update adds small, incremental improvements which won't matter to the vast majority, but for a little subset of users, might be the thing that gets them to use one or all of the apps. </p>
<p> Microsoft PowerPoint </p>
<p> The major thing that's new in PowerPoint is the ability to share only one slide. It can get really annoying when to send one slide in a presentation of many slides, you have to send the entire thing and say 'look at slide 22,' or whatever. </p>
<p> Third-party cloud storage platforms like Dropbox and Box have been available in desktop versions of Microsoft Office for a few years, but the mobile versions have been much more limited. Oh, they supported OneDrive, but who uses that? Starting today, you have new storage options and a few more on on the way. </p>
<p> Microsoft has long since abandoned the strategy of keeping its apps and services confined to its own platform. Windows Phone didn't really work out, so it's not like there's another option. Microsoft's Word, PowerPoint, and Excel apps are getting a nice update today on Android that makes them better at handling shared content. PowerPoint also gets some UI tweaks. </p>
<p> In the latest series of updates to Microsoft's Office apps for Android, the headlining feature is inking support with a couple of other minor additions. Of those, the one most likely to affect your day-to-day use is that each app now allows for saving to SD cards. </p>
<p> Still, the most exciting part of these updates is inking. As the name suggests, this is digital ink. You can draw with your finger or stylus, as I did in the image below. If you have a phone or tablet with an active digitizer like the Samsung Note series, they will support those pressure-sensitive features as well. </p>

<p> Squarespace is a one-stop-shop allowing you to build your own website with practically no prior experience: Changes in the editor show you an exact representation of the final product. While the desktop back end has worked great for many users for a long time, the rise of smartphones and the shift to our always-online culture might require you to edit your website on the move. This is where Squarespace's completely reworked Android app comes into play, allowing you to edit posts, manage blogs and galleries, and access basic analytics. </p>
<p> While personal blogs aren't really the thing they once were, Google believes they "add to the vitality of the web." To that end, the company has introduced Blog Compass, a new platform for managing blogs. The app is currently only available as a beta in India, but it could come to more regions depending on its popularity and user feedback. </p>
<p> This post is a bit meta, as Android Police itself is a WordPress-powered site. But anyone who uses WordPress will appreciate the massive, much-needed feature introduced in the beta version of the Android app today: finally, a true visual editor. </p>
<p> You see, previous versions of the WordPress Android app have offered a semi-functional visual editor when publishing or editing content, but this editor was extremely basic. Certain formatting and content like bolding, italicizing, underlining, strikethrough, quote blocks, hyperlinks, and images could be previewed live in the editor - but only when publishing a new post. When editing an existing post, the shortcuts for these tools were still available on the toolbar at the bottom of the screen, but they inserted the naked HTML markup into the editor, because the editor was, to use the technical term, janky as hell. </p>
<p> The WordPress Android app probably won't have you closing your laptop to go do most of your blogging from the backseat of a car, but it does a decent enough job, and the app looks pretty. The latest version of the app continues the march towards both replicating the desktop experience and integrating with Android's design language. </p>
<p> Version 4.9 spruced up the screen that tells you the size of your images and their file names. You can also upload multiple images and video clips at a time. </p>
<p> The changelog mentions unlocking the screen using your fingerprint, a feature that presumably only appears on devices with the necessary hardware. </p>
<p> The WordPress developers have bumped the Android app up to version 4.4, introducing a number of visual tweaks in the process. Some of them are better for phones than they are for tablets. Whether they're an improvement is for you to judge. </p>
<p> For starters, the page and post list page has changed from two panels into a list of floating titles. You can see the headline, a few lines of text, and a featured image. Edit, Preview, Stats, and Trash options line the bottom. </p>
<p> This change results in less information displayed on tablets in landscape mode than we saw in previous versions. </p>
<p> WordPress went material in version 3.5. Now in 4.1, the app has undergone what may be an even larger design change. Say goodbye to the navigation menu you're used to sliding out from the side of the screen. Now everything you need is tucked away inside four tabs spread along the action bar at the top. </p>
<p> The first tab, which also serves as the landing screen, provides just about everything you'd expect in the side menu. From here you can view your site and open posts. When you click the back button, it takes you back to this page. </p>
<p> The second tab shows posts from Freshly Pressed, WordPress's blog. </p>
<p> Folks editing their WordPress blogs from an Android device running Lollipop are in for a treat. The latest version of the app applies a fresh taste of material design. At the end of the day, the experience doesn't look fundamentally different, but you get a full hamburger menu, a floating action button, and a sidebar that slides out on top of everything else. </p>
<p> The WordPress Android app isn't the most feature-rich means of editing a blog, but it's arguably the quickest. The latest version of the software brings about a number of improvements that round out the experience. The list of a site's posts now refreshes automatically, but there's still the option to refresh manually either through the menu or by pulling down on the screen. This update also brings in the ability to infinitely swipe through posts. In addition to that, the QuickPress widget has been fixed, though you're not missing out on much if you haven't used it before. All it does is link to the app's new post page. </p>
<p> The official WordPress app for Android got a significant bump to version 3.0 today. Users who host a free blog on WordPress.com will see the greatest benefit from the added features, but just about everyone will see something new, and the bug fixes don't hurt either. The app doesn't have much to show in the user interface department, though it's been pretty solid since the Holo redesign in any case. </p>
<p> First of all, you should now be able to swipe left and right to advance or go back between individual posts in the "View site" option on the sidebar. </p>
<p> Like most tech blogs, Android Police uses WordPress. And since the web interface still leaves a lot to be desired on phones and tablets, we rely on the WordPress app to make quick adjustments when we're out and about. The latest update to the official app isn't exactly revolutionary, but anyone who uses it on a regular basis will probably find a few things to like. </p>
<p> First: the refresh button is no more. It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to its designer. Instead, users can now refresh the list of blog posts and drafts by dragging down on the list, a la Gmail and lots of other trendy apps. </p>

<p> wordpress for android </p>
<p> This post is a bit meta, as Android Police itself is a WordPress-powered site. But anyone who uses WordPress will appreciate the massive, much-needed feature introduced in the beta version of the Android app today: finally, a true visual editor. </p>
<p> You see, previous versions of the WordPress Android app have offered a semi-functional visual editor when publishing or editing content, but this editor was extremely basic. Certain formatting and content like bolding, italicizing, underlining, strikethrough, quote blocks, hyperlinks, and images could be previewed live in the editor - but only when publishing a new post. When editing an existing post, the shortcuts for these tools were still available on the toolbar at the bottom of the screen, but they inserted the naked HTML markup into the editor, because the editor was, to use the technical term, janky as hell. </p>

<p> We all remember Tiny Thief, but let's set those memories aside for a moment. Rovio Stars is back with another Android title. Word Monsters is a puzzle game that's so social, it requires players to sign in using Google or Facebook immediately after completing the initial tutorial. The game itself is an adorable take on word search. Look for words on-screen and swipe them to get points. Doing so will cause them to disappear, sometimes removing letters needed for future words and adding some degree of strategy to the experience. </p>
<p> When it comes time to learn a new language on a mobile device (what, you haven't?), Duolingo is the first that comes to mind. But let's say you've completed everything that app has to offer - what then? Lingua.ly has arrived for Android, and it's ready to help newcomers learn any of over twenty languages. </p>
<p> As a writer, I pretty much like words. That's my job. Well, it's not my job to like words, but it helps. It's my job to write words in a coherent and entertaining manner. But I digress, this isn't about stringing words together into sentences; it's about stacking words on top of each other in a Tetris-like game for the aspiring wordsmith. Sure, it may sound a bit confusing, but in reality the concept appears to be relatively simple. </p>
<p> Over on the iOS side of things, W.E.L.D.E.R. has made quite a name for itself with unique word-based gameplay and a real sense of humor. Now you too can get in on the fun with W.E.L.D.E.R. on your Android device of choice. Make sure you check out the video below so you know what you're getting into. This is serious business. </p>
<p> W.E.L.D.E.R. is a bit like a combination of Boggle, Scrabble, and Bejeweled. </p>
<p> There are two things I know about chess for sure: I like playing it and I hate playing against computers. Computers are cold, calculating, and just generally smarter than me. They don't make mistakes. They want to take over my planet with their cold, metal claw-hands and laser eyes. If something is going to make me feel stupid, it damn well better be a person. This is why I like Chess-presso. </p>

<p> work chat </p>
<p> Email client? Work chat client? Why not have one app for both? So thinks Ginger Labs — the people behind iOS annotation app Notability — who have come up with a new messaging medium cheekily called Twobird. This metaphorical single stone, which lets users craft notes, to-do lists, spreadsheets, and accumulate replies all on an in-line thread, is now available for early access on the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> If you're one of the select few who work for a company that uses Facebook for Work, then Facebook has just released the messaging app for you. Work Chat is Facebook's take on work-based communication apps like Slack and Hipchat — although it does feel slightly barebones for now. </p>
<p> Work Chat joins Facebook's other work-related app, aptly named Facebook at Work, released back in January. It is pretty much identical to Facebook's regular Messenger app, with the exception that you can only chat with your "work friends." The first version of the app allows users to message coworkers, create work groups, place VoIP calls, and send stickers. </p>

<p> workout headphones </p>
<p> Along with three new true wireless earbuds, Plantronics introduced last month a new over-ear headphone model. The BackBeat Fit 6100 offer a unique proposition for gym goers and workout aficionados who don't like in-ear buds: they're over-ear cans made specifically to withstand sweat and exercise, but they suit your commuter lifestyle or desk job just as well. The $180 price is on the high side, though. </p>
<p> If you work out a lot like I do, you know how important it is to have the right headphones during your session. I've learned that the hard way: Five years ago when I started lifting, I would use the cheap earphones that came with my handset, but I quickly gave up because the wires would get caught in different things or an earpiece would fail in the middle of a workout. They eventually drowned in my sweat and died, so I decided to get a pair of wireless earphones especially designed for athletes that cost me about $180 back then. </p>

<p> Workout Mix </p>
<p> YouTube Music is due to become Google's only music service by the end of this year. In anticipation of taking the spotlight, the platform has been rapidly adding features and making tweaks lately, such as the ability to swipe between tracks and start playback directly from the album art. Last month, four new Mix playlists were spotted in the wild, and now it looks like those are becoming more widely available. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/20 2:50pm PDTon May 20, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/16 10:55am PDTon Jun 16, 2020. </p>
<p> YouTube Music already has a few Spotify-like dynamic "Mix" playlists, but more might be coming in the future. A new (but, sadly, non-functional) "Focus Mix" playlist has been spotted in the wild, plus a "related" tab loaded with similar artists and other music nestled inside the new pull-out section now-playing interface. </p>

<p> workplace by facebook </p>
<p> Over a year ago, Facebook began testing their internal communication tool, Facebook at Work, with a number of organizations. Not only has Facebook renamed the platform to 'Workplace by Facebook,' they are finally publicly releasing it. Starting today, any company can use Workplace. </p>
<p> In the same vein as Google+ for Work, Workplace tries to adapt social networks for internal use at businesses. Facebook's news feed, search, trending posts, live video, and more have all made the jump. Workplace also features unlimited file, photo, and video storage, monitoring tools, team and project groups, and Single-sign on (SSO) support. Integration with G Suite (the new name for Google Apps for Work), Okta, OneLogin, Ping, and Windows Azure AD is also supported. </p>

<p> Google Workspace is replacing G Suite, and anyone interested in the new features can sign up or switch over to the service right now (unless they're managing an Education or Non-profit organization). But if you're one of the many people relying on G Suite's $12/month unlimited storage "hack," you might be better off sticking to your current G Suite plan — if you want unlimited storage on the new Workspace tiers, it will cost you at least $20 a month. </p>
<p> Google Drive is the place to save your files and collaborate on them. If you're anything like me, however, your data will clutter until the place looks like it's been hit by a bomb. Luckily, Google knows us and is adding a Priority page to Drive that will show you the documents it thinks are the most relevant to you right now. </p>
<p> Friday evening brought us another update to the Google app. Unlike the previous version, there are a fair number of topics to discuss from a teardown. Google is preparing a screen for viewing your image searches from Lens, Collection sharing, a few changes to the layout of settings, and there are even hints of a mystery feature named Workspaces. </p>
<p> Every week, I examine somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred app updates while looking for changes. The most interesting things turn into APK Teardowns or Download posts. Many of the remaining updates are unremarkable, amounting to a few bug fixes, routine updates to libraries, or even just pixel-level adjustments to layouts and images. However, there are usually a few updates that land somewhere in between. I don't want to spam readers with dozens of short posts, but I hate to ignore things that people might want to know about, so I'm going to wrap up the leftovers for a little weekend reading and call it Update Notes. </p>

<p> Works with Google Assistant </p>
<p> When Google decided to deprecate its Works with Nest API, there was a litany of questions left behind of what would happen. Some of those answers came when third parties started sending notices to Nest product owners saying that their apps and routines would not work with their cameras, thermostats, and other appliances past August 31 (or earlier). At the same time, as Nest account holders begrudgingly move their roots to a Google account, there are questions as to if all the Works with Nest integrations will be carried over. Google has come back today with answers. </p>
<p> If you ask my neighbors, they'll probably tell you they've heard me shout "OK Google; I'm leaving" at least once. This isn't because I like everybody to know I'm headed out, but rather to turn every smart device off using Assistant. You could argue that since I'm carrying my phone with me, I could set up a routine that does it for me, but I would need to do that for every single app that can control my IoT objects, and I'm not comfortable sharing my location with some of these companies. Lastly, not all of my smart plugs work with IFTTT, so that's not an option either. </p>

<p> If there is a parallel universe in which World War 2 didn't occur, I'd bet there are far fewer games there. Well, like it or not Hills of Glory 3D is a WWII-themed title that's part strategy and part "castle defense." On the upside, it's pretty enjoyable. </p>
<p> This is a follow up to the original Hills of Glory, but this time with a whole extra dimension. The graphics are clean and cartoon-y – it actually looks surprisingly good for only being a 49MB download. </p>
<p> Popular Android game developer HandyGames has released a sequel to its well received Guns'n'Glory tower defence game called Guns'n'Glory WW2. The original Guns'n'Glory was a Wild West themed game that put you in charge of mobile units which you had to place in strategic position in order to ambush settlers, stagecoaches and "the gold train". The original game took the concept of a tower defence game and put an intriguing spin on it by allowing the enemy units to fight back. </p>

<p> We've already run down the five best things about the Galaxy S20 Ultra, so now it's time to look at the ways in which it disappoints. It's not unreasonable to expect a $1,400 phone to be damn near perfect, but the S20 Ultra sadly has a few negatives points that bring its overall score down. You can check out our full review to see what Ryan thought about it, but here's a summary of the least appealing aspects of the S20 Ultra. </p>
<p> There's a lot to like about the OnePlus 6. It looks great, its got that genius alert slider, and it charges really fast. It isn't perfect, though; to hit an appropriately OnePlus price point, some corners invariably must be cut. Last month, we shared with you six things we liked about the OnePlus 6. Now, here are five things we don't. </p>
<p> 2011 was a great year for Android - Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich was announced. The Galaxy Nexus was released. A whole truckload of Android tablets came out. The first 4G LTE smartphones appeared. But there were some significant speed bumps as well. Here are, in no particular order, the five things in the world of Android in the last year that really got our hopes up, but ended up being a little disappointing. </p>
<p> 1. HTC ThunderBolt / All Early Verizon 4G LTE Phones </p>
<p> It's really hard to know where to start with the ThunderBolt. It wasn't actually a terrible phone in terms of usability or performance, but the delayed release, abysmal battery life, overheating, and seemingly endless wait for Android 2.3 drew more angst from owners than probably any other device we've ever seen. </p>
<p> The upcoming 3D phone from LG, Optimus 3D, may be cool, with its glasses-free 3D and a dual-core CPU, but it certainly didn't stop the company from producing one of the cheesiest/worst commercials we've ever seen. </p>
<p> The premise is decent - a girl is doing yoga, and her 3D-capable phone provides her with 3D training videos, but the execution... well, you decide, because I'm out of words: </p>

<p> wp7 </p>
<p> I want to ask everyone a question - well, everyone who owns an Android tablet, that is - how often do you instinctively reach for it, as opposed to your phone or laptop? I don't care what the reason is, I'm just genuinely curious how much of a "tweener" role your Android tablet has taken in your life. And after you read this editorial, share that story with me in the comments, because I'd really like to have a discussion with people on this. </p>
<p> It certainly seems like it. Yesterday, Microsoft announced via blog that it had concluded negotiations with Samsung and reached a licensing deal for the same seven patents it previously licensed to HTC for Android (along with other, smaller Android manufacturers). There were rumblings about just what royalty rate Samsung is paying, but the guess is anywhere from $5 to $15 per handset (it's likely on a percentage-of-MSRP basis - so think about 1-3% per $500 MSRP phone). </p>
<p> For every Windows Phone 7-inspired app, launcher, or theme we've written about, a half-dozen more, often clones, go unmentioned. But every now and then we find something we haven't seen before, and this is one of those times. It's called WP7Contacts, and as you would surmise, it's a contact manager inspired by Windows Phone 7. </p>
<p> It's official: Nokia and Microsoft have formed a strategic alliance. Which, in layman's terms, means Nokia smartphones will be powered by Windows Phone 7, and search across all Nokia devices will be powered by Bing. What does this mean for Android, though? </p>
<p> Well, who knows. On the one hand, this is a move by Nokia to try to stop hemorrhaging customers, especially from the highly profitable smartphone segment. </p>

<p> wpa3 </p>
<p> CES 2020 gave the networking device market a solid head start for the rest of the year. We not only saw a more capable Wi-Fi standard come into being but also mainstream brands jumping in with a pile of new routers and mesh systems. Besides an expanded security camera lineup, D-Link’s CES announcement includes a long list of routers and range extenders that integrate the EasyMesh and Wi-Fi 6 standard. </p>
<p> With the launch of Nest Wifi, we've learned that this new mesh system is backward-compatible with the existing Google Wifi, but if you're happy with your setup and have no plans to get a new Nest router or access point, you can still get a little benefit out of adding your old Wifi to the Google Home app. That lets you manage a few things from a central location and adds WPA3 security to the Wifis. </p>
<p> The vast majority of people out there don't know much about network security, if at all, but thankfully there are talented groups and individuals out there who are on constant lookout for flaws and vulnerabilities. Each security protocol we've seen has had some kind of issue (sometimes crippling), but the still-young Wi-Fi Protected Access protocol version 3, aka WPA3, remains vulnerable to attack, thanks to some pretty serious design flaws. </p>
<p> We're likely a couple of months away from the first developer preview build of Android Q, but already we know a fair amount about what to expect from the next major version. Most excitingly, we could be finally getting a system-wide dark mode. We can now say with a greater degree of certainty that Android Q will carry the version number 10, plus we've learned a few more tidbits. </p>
<p> The Wi-Fi Alliance has announced additional measures to secure wireless devices, following revelations last year about an oversight in the WPA2 specification which left devices vulnerable. </p>

<p> wristband </p>
<p> Sony, LG, and Razer all announced fitness bands at this year's CES, but we shouldn't let this distract us from the options already on the market. The Jawbone Up app has been available on Google Play for quite some time, and now the company is bringing support for its newer Up24 band to Android via an app update. </p>
<p> We're well into the holiday season here in the US, and I know new electronics aren't the only things many of you have picked up lately. If you have some new pounds you're looking to shave, Best Buy has a deal that may just make doing so a little bit easier - or at least more fun. The Fitbit Flex fitness bracelet is currently on sale for $79.99, a savings of $20 from its usual price. </p>
<p> When Jawbone's UP wristband was released in late 2011, I was excited. Then I was disappointed. The motion-tracking band seemed like a perfect step into wearable tech at the time, but its companion app wasn't available for Android. Whether and why Jawbone didn't see fit to invest resources in developing for Android was a mystery, but now – thankfully – it's immaterial. Just over a week ago, Jawbone released an official UP app to the Google Play Store, and I wanted to be first in line to try it out with Jawbone's updated 2012 wristband. </p>
<p> Did you enter 2013 with visions of eating healthily, becoming more active, and staying fit? Not so easy a few months down the line, is it? The good news is that Jawbone may have just provided you with that extra boost that you needed, as the UP app is finally available for Android. </p>
<p> On the surface, the Jawbone UP wristband is comparable to the Nike+ Fuelband, although with the app in tow it allows you to take a more holistic view, tracking your sleep patterns, looking at how you eat every day, and how much exercise you do. </p>

<p> writing </p>
<p> Repeating the same words makes for sub-par writing, which is why most authors employ synonyms to diversify the vocabulary they use. Even though writing is usually done on computers, a lot of it happens on our mobiles, and finding synonyms should be as simple as when you're working on your laptop. Thankfully, Grammarly's keyboard can now suggest analog words as you type, so your messages can be more remarkable than ever. </p>
<p> I have been trying to write about Medium's 2.0 update for a few hours, but I got lost using the app, enjoying it, and I even decided to sign up and write one of my first non-Android stories in years. That's how you know the app is not just good, it's great. I have always thought about joining Medium, but I never felt compelled to. I guess this update was the final push I needed, and I decided to pull the trigger and dive deep in the service. </p>
<p> But let's get back to Medium's update. You may recall that the app was released mere months ago, but it has seen a steady stream of improvements since then. </p>
<p> Do you long for the simpler days of pen and paper? Do you need direct pen input to your tablet or phone for drawing or equations? Do you just want a really nifty folio case to make all the other board members jealous at the next meeting? In all three cases, Wacom has you covered. The famous graphics tablet company is branching further into mobile accessories with the Bamboo Paper, a folio that combines some impressive technology to let you write on standard paper and save your work digitally to Android or iOS. </p>
<p> Here's how it works. The Spark includes a specialized Bluetooth-enabled pen, but it's writing in old-fashioned ink - there's no stylus, powered or otherwise, in the package. </p>
<p> I love JotterPad. I've said it before, but I thought I'd preface with this disclaimer and then convince you why you should love it too. I'm not in the business of coercing anyone, but I think we'd all be better off if we did more writing, be it regular note taking, prose, poetry, journaling, or anything that involves putting a series of words in an order that makes sense with a decent serving of imagery and correct grammar sprinkled on top. </p>
<p> If words are your passion too, then you'll be happy to know that JotterPad X dumped its Roman numeral and got a kick up to JotterPad 11. </p>
<p> You probably know Squarespace as a paid what-you-see-is-what-you-get website creator, which is the main focus of the product. But the company has been working on a few mobile apps as of late, and today two of them are available on Android. Well, they were available before, but now you can use them without having to go through the somewhat convoluted Google+ beta community system. Meet Squarespace Blog and Squarespace Note. </p>
<p> Blog is basically Squarespace's oh-so-pretty version of the official WordPress app. It lets you log into any Squarespace account or site to add textual posts or edit the ones you've already completed. </p>
<p> Traditionally word processors have tasked themselves with producing nice, printable documents. Mobile versions have followed up with the unenviable task of replicating this functionality on much smaller screens. Quip throws this entire concept out of the window, instead creating a writing experience built for the ground up for mobile devices. The team released an alpha version over the summer, but it was little more than a demo of the iOS version of the app. Now the full version is available, and it looks right at home on Android devices. </p>
<p> I'm going to be really honest about this one: I had no idea that anyone still uses LiveJournal. Much to my surprise, though, it has been going strong all this time - it's even ranked #71 in the world according to Alexa. After realizing that tidbit of information, it's not surprising at all that there is now an official LiveJournal App for Android. </p>
<p> For a mobile blogging app, I must say that this one seems quite feature rich: you can post new journal entries and photos, create polls, edit entries, create drafts, and manage settings. From just a quick look, I think that this may be the best on-the-go blogging app that I've seen thus far. </p>
<p> When Gingerbread was launched back in December of last year, we learned that one of its main selling points was Near Field Communication (NFC) support, which allowed for NFC-enabled devices to communicate when placed near each other. </p>
<p> Using your Android phone as a credit card or sharing information by bringing 2 devices close to each other seemed like a dream come true until we found that NFC support in Gingerbread was actually quite limited - writing/transmitting was not possible and only a limited subset of reading APIs was available. </p>
<p> Today, Google announced a new Gingerbread update bearing version number 2.3.3. The update is concentrated mostly around NFC, introducing writing/transmitting APIs and support for a wider range of NFC standards. </p>

<p> WSJ </p>
<p> Nintendo is reportedly encouraging its smartphone game development partners to focus on fun instead of maximum revenue. It would appear that Nintendo sees the smartphone gaming market as a way to increase interest in its properties with the hope that its smartphone customers will find their way to the console market, the company's bread and butter. </p>
<p> A possible merger between T-Mobile and Sprint has been a topic of discussion and rumors for years. Last month, it was revealed that the two companies were (again) in talks of a merger, with T-Mobile's parent company Deutsche Telekom having majority ownership of the new carrier. </p>
<p> The Wall Street Journal has just released a new Android app called WSJ AR. It is an augmented reality app that allows you to navigate a visualization of the US stock market via your Tango phone. In addition to overall market representations, you can zoom in to look at individual stock details, view headlines related to the selected stock, and save your favorites. </p>
<p> Quite a lot of us have done away with the landline telephones that used to be a staple of homes in the developed world. A 2013 survey concluded that over 40% of US households had ditched their standard landlines phones, driven by younger users relying exclusively on their cell phones. But according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, both Google and Amazon are looking to revive the landline (well, VOIP line anyway) as a bonus feature in their voice-controlled Wi-Fi speakers, the Google Home and Amazon Echo/Tap/Echo Dot. </p>
<p> Google, for all its skill in the realms of mobile search, advertising, email, and even operating systems, has never been particularly good at the social thing. Even now, I suspect, someone at Google is fuming at the notion that the company "isn't very good" at messaging or social networks and pointing animatedly at the tens of millions of Google+ and Hangouts users. The problem is and has always been that for whatever success Google has had in social and messaging platforms, it is constantly undercut by the actions of Google itself that say otherwise. There is near-yearly reworking, redesigning, or branching off of these products in ways that very strongly suggest they aren't getting the results Google's Alphabet overlords consider acceptable. </p>
<p> According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is working on a few things. They are, according to the world's most infamous tipster "People Familiar With The Matter," working on an Android-powered video game console. And a smart watch. And a new Nexus Q. And the possibility of Android-powered appliances (like refrigerators). And Laptops. And, oh yeah, low-cost phones for developing markets. </p>
<p> Typically we avoid reporting on too-good-to-be-true rumors, but today's alleged revelation is a real whopper. Since it comes from the Wall Street Journal – which often comes through on rumors – it might just be worth keeping an eye on. </p>
<p> If you thought Google Fiber sounded like a game changer, you may want to keep an eye on this story. According to the Wall Street Journal, which has a history of having well-placed sources, Google has held talks with Dish Network discussing the possibility of partnering on a wireless carrier to compete with AT&T, Verizon, and all the rest. At first, it sounds like a pipe dream. The kind we've been hoping for since the G1. Thing is, this time, it has a shot of not being complete bupkis. </p>
<p> Before we get into why this might be true, though, let's take a look at why it might be false: for starters, according to WSJ's own sources, the talks are not very advanced and "could amount to nothing." </p>
<p> The rumor mill giveth and the rumor mill taketh away. Late Sunday night, a commenter on our site posted a surprising confession: he was the source of several rumors regarding Android 4.2. Initially, we confirmed that this commenter was the same who had sent us some different yet equally fantastic stories. Our batch hinted that Robert Downey Jr. might have been hired to introduce the new Nexii for the next couple years, for example. Now, Android & Me has posted a retraction of the initial article stating that Android 4.2 would contain a Customization Center and Project Roadrunner. </p>
<p> However, the commenter known as Peter claimed that a certain set of Android rumors were not a part of his elaborate and entertaining ruse. </p>
<p> Just last week, Sprint finally lit up its LTE network. Not before selling a number of LTE-equipped phones, however. If you were worried about Sprint's ability to keep up with the big dogs in the race to expand LTE coverage, the WSJ has some comforting words for you. Wait, did I say "comforting"? I'm sorry, I meant worrying. Very, very worrying. </p>
<p> The long and short of it is, Sprint simply doesn't seem to have enough spectrum to keep up. The initial LTE rollout covered 15 markets, compared to Verizon's 330 and AT&T's 47. Despite the rather distant third-place position, Sprint hopes to have coverage in all areas by the end of 2013. </p>
<p> I know the subject of Twitter buying another company is not directly related to Android, but considering the importance of the social service in our day-to-day operations and the target of the rumor being TweetDeck, a crowd favorite when it comes to Twitter clients, I thought I'd give this one a mention. </p>
<p> According to a report published today by The Wall Street Journal, Twitter is reportedly in talks to buy TweetDeck for $50 million. This comes after relatively recent news of UberMedia's $30 million bid in cash and stock. As we've seen, UberMedia and Twitter don't have the best rapport, so keeping TweetDeck out of UberMedia's hands may well be in the best interest of Twitter itself. </p>

<p> wtf </p>
<p> What's this? A bonus round of app sales... on a Thursday? Still your beating hearts, dear readers of mine, because while I have more apps for you today, I've decided to take a different approach. Due to the volume of yesterday's post and the amount of questionable applications in it, I am trying something new today. </p>
<p> The dating simulator genre is still somewhat niche, so here's a quick breakdown if you haven't heard about it. In a typical anime-style dating simulator, you play as a young man or woman (often high school or college age) looking for love. This usually means talking to a bunch of different characters and potential romantic interests in branching dialogue. It's like an old-school adventure game, but the stakes are your love life instead of saving the world. Hatoful Boyfriend [sic] is like that, except that all your suitors are pigeons. </p>
<p> I recall with fondness the endless speculative arguments I heard around the elementary school lunch table in the 90s: who would win in a fight between Batman and Wolverine? Goku and Superman? Bill Clinton and Emilio Estevez? (There was always that one weird kid.) Imagine the same arguments happening in a university zoology department, and you might just find the inspiration for Animelee, an old-fashioned one-on-one fighter recently published in the Play Store. It's all about animals beating the crap out of each other. Check out the eye-popping trailer below: </p>
<p> It has now been over two months since the Lollipop OTA updates for Nexus devices began rolling out en masse. So far, every Nexus and Google Play Edition device has received the bump to Google's latest sweet treat...except the cellular Nexus 7s. If you own a 2012 3G or 2013 LTE model, you've been left out in the cold, remaining on KitKat unless you want to venture into the world of custom ROMs. </p>
<p> Update delays when you own a Nexus are quite annoying when you consider that bleeding edge versions of Android are the reason most of us buy them in the first place. </p>
<p> Following on the success of the original xkcd Phone (which featured a blend of Android and iOS, a side-facing camera, and the ability to scream when falling), a successor has arrived that offers some of the best tech that 2014 has to offer. </p>
<p> The xkcd Phone 2 includes a revolutionary always-on front-facing speaker, which the phone will use to automatically cry when lost. With a built-in, ribbed, auto-rotating case made of 3D materials, the handset should feel comfortable in any hand size. And in a year where phones argued that HD wasn't HD enough, the xkcd Phone 2's MaxHD display competes by cramming over 350 pixels onto its screen (and doubling as a cheek toucher). </p>
<p> Not all new features are created equal, and this particular change has us kind of scratching our heads wondering why Google would consider it a good idea. In Lollipop, you can now access your quick settings straight from the lockscreen. This way you can toggle Wi-Fi, cellular data, and Bluetooth without unlocking the device, even if it's secured behind a passphrase. </p>
<p> Google's developers are notorious for including little jokes and easter eggs throughout all of their products. When your job consists of writing thousands of lines of code and testing obscure bugs, you're going to lose your mind without some kind of outlet. We usually see their sense of humor show up in Google Doodles, easter eggs, and even in the occasional bug report. </p>
<p> This time we're diving straight into the Android SDK to check out a function called isUserAGoat. This is for real, people. And as a few Android developers could tell you, it's actually been there since Android 4.2 (API 17). </p>
<p> Perhaps you recall back in 2012 when Google caught some flack for its 10-device limit on Play Music access with only four deauthorizations per year. It was forced to backpedal and allow users to deauthorize unlimited devices, and all was well with the world. Well, until now. It looks like Google has started enforcing a limit of four deauthorizations per year once again. Support docs and the Play Music settings list the limit. That means even regular users could suddenly find themselves unable to use All Access or get to their own stored tunes. </p>
<p> Classic American diners and 70s-era video games go hand in hand. No, wait a minute. That's an insane statement. Those things don't have anything to do with one another... until now. Denny's, the after-hours haunt of college students and cross-country travelers all over the United States, has launched a special version of three Atari video games. The app icon has Denny's bacon strips in place of the iconic stripes in Atari's logo. That tells you pretty much all you need to know. </p>
<p> The three games in question are Hashteroids, Centipup, and Take-Out, and no, you don't get any extra points for figuring out which classic arcade titles those titles are lampooning. </p>
<p> Some characters have to be shoehorned into an endless runner, but for Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog, the genre is a natural fit. Now Sega is offering a Nintendo-style promotion that's only available for Android. Here's your chance to take our lovable green Bugdroid out for a spin, as the developers have dropped it into the game and are daring players to see if machines really are better at everything. </p>
<p> But that's not all. Players who play as Bugdroid fifty times can permanently unlock "Andronic," a disturbingly deformed version of Sonic that looks as though it has been crammed into a soda can and given pills for limbs. Dr. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/wunderlist/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17483604" filename="wunderlist">
<p> Today is finally the day Wunderlist dies, years after the Microsoft acquisition. Former users are encouraged to switch to Microsoft To Do, Wunderlist's spiritual successor as a Redmond product. To make the jump smoother on the last possible day, the company has added some more features known from Wunderlist, like overviews of your tasks for today, tomorrow, or the week ahead as well as new All and Completed smart lists. </p>
<p> Today's the day we say goodbye to Wunderlist, a beloved productivity app for many. The service was bought by Microsoft back in 2015, and the company preferred to replace it with a new app instead of keeping it alive. Sadly, To-Do, the in-house successor, didn't live up to several people's expectations, including myself, who turned to alternative solutions. It seems the developers are aware of their disappointment and have used the opportunity to announce a new productivity app called Superlist. </p>
<p> If you're a Wunderlist user, you're probably aware the app is set to disappear next month. I've personally used it for years and swore by it. I gave Microsoft's in-house replacement a try, but it wasn't good enough for me, so I had to turn to another solution. However, there's a new player on the market that might be the perfect replacement for Wunderlist, called Zenkit To Do. In fact, it looks so similar to Wunderlist that you might actually think it's just an updated version. </p>
<p> Microsoft has announced that it's finally killing the well-known and much-loved productivity app Wunderlist on May 6th, 2020. One app's end is another's "new beginning" according to the company, with all efforts now focused on Microsoft's descriptively titled "To Do," which was explicitly labeled at launch as a replacement that would ultimately result in Wunderlist's retirement. </p>
<p> It's looking like a busy week for the app devs at Microsoft. After yesterday's announcement that Groups is being added to the Outlook mail app, today sees another interesting addition to the company's productivity suite on Android. To-Do is Microsoft's attempt at an intelligent task management app, in much the same vein as Wunderlist, which was acquired by the Redmond giant back in 2015. </p>
<p> Microsoft wants Outlook to be the one destination you have to visit to know what's going on. It also wants to make use of the talent it acquired when it purchased Sunrise. So the company is delivering on old promises by introducing Calendar Apps, which let you see tasks and notes from different sources. The opening salvo of supported services consists of Evernote, Facebook, and Wunderlist. </p>
<p> Late yesterday, the Financial Times reported that SwiftKey was in talks with Microsoft about a potential acquisition that could be officially announced during the week. The report was right and this morning both Microsoft and SwiftKey have made the news official on their respective blogs. </p>
<p> The financial details of the acquisition weren't disclosed, but yesterday's report mentioned a $250 Million figure — or about a quarter Instagram if you want. The rest of the deal's terms aren't perfectly transparent either, but SwiftKey's co-founders Jon and Ben made it clear that the keyboard will continue to be developed for Android and iOS. </p>
<p> Our number one focus has always been to build the best possible products for our users. </p>
<p> Getting bought by Microsoft hasn't hindered the productive folks over at Wunderlist. They're now ready to roll out an update to their Android app with a revamped interface that finally looks good enough to deserve a Material Design adjective. Its previous update had claimed that, but it was actually the bastard child of some iOS and Android design elements. This one, on the contrary, does away with the clunky design, reduces a few shadows, flattens a couple of boxes, cleans some icons, and generally looks shiny, in a faded pastel kind of way. </p>
<p> The update isn't just superficial though. It adds a shortcut to create new tasks from the notification bar and a Quick-Add function to send tasks to their lists and assign dates to them (type "tomorrow at 9am" and Wunderlist will schedule your task for that time). </p>
<p> According to the Wall Street Journal, Microsoft has agreed to pay between $100 million and $200 million for 6Wunderkinder, the German company behind the to-do list app. </p>

A solar-powered personal telepathy machine for the eco-friendly supervillain? The answer is none of the above: it's a giant plastic dome that, according to creator Silentium, cancels out surrounding ambient noise. </p>

<p> WWII </p>
<p> It might be tempting to think that there's nothing new under the sun for top-down airplane shoot-em-ups. After all, the genre has been kicking around since the 1970s. But you'd be wrong - in fact, the vertical layout and touch controls on smartphones make them ideal for this sort of title, as exemplified by Air Attack way back in 2011. The original game was one of our favorites during the initial Android boom, and now the sequel has arrived. Air Attack 2 is free to download on the Play Store today. </p>
<p> There were many real world ramifications from World War II, but one of the more relevant to our coverage on Android Police is that it gave developers material for no fewer than a zillion games. HandyGames saw success with its last WWII title, 1941 Frozen Front, and now the sequel known as 1942 Pacific Front is available for download. It's essentially the same thing but with less snow. </p>

<p> Wyze Bulb </p>
<p> Smart home and camera accessories brand, Wyze, is celebrating its 2-year anniversary since releasing the first Wyze Cam in 2017. To mark the occasion, the company is giving its customers free shipping on its entire portfolio of products, but only for today with a special promo code. </p>
<p> Wyze is on a mission to convert your house into a full-blown smart home, even if it has to do so piece by piece. The company started out selling very affordable surveillance cameras, which have only become more powerful as they pick up new functionality. </p>
<p> Wyze has just revealed its latest smart home gadget, and this time it's a light bulb. The new Wyze Bulb is LED-based, works over Wi-Fi, doesn't need a hub, spits up to 800 lumens, and has both a tunable white point and adjustable brightness. While Wyze has opened early access pre-orders today, they don't ship until June. The official launch is nebulously set for "later this year." Prices will run $30 for four, or $8 for one. </p>

<p> LineageOS is the most popular custom ROM around, with official support for dozens of devices and a huge community. The project relies on the work of contributing developers, which means phones can just easily be dropped as they are added. Since we last covered LineageOS, a few new devices are now supported, while a handful of fan favorites have been dropped. </p>

<p> Sony Ericsson posted profits of 35 million euros ($47.14 million) in Q4 of 2010, due largely to major downsizing combined with a shift towards Android-based smartphones. Although Sony Ericsson sold fewer phones overall, Android enthusiasts will be happy to hear that they managed to sell over 9 million Android-based Xperia phones, including the X10, X10 Mini, X10 Pro, and X8, since their launch. </p>
<p> In the last year, Sony has made significant changes after reporting losses of 836 million euros in 2009 ($1.13 billion). </p>
<p> This morning Sony Ericsson posted a teaser video on YouTube explaining to X10 users the differences they will find in the update from Android 1.6 to 2.1. As painful as it is to watch a video of someone demonstrating five homescreens, slide-to-unlock and live wallpapers like they're brand new features, the video underscores the growing expectation that an update will be released for the X10 within the next few days. </p>
<p> (Note – It does have some wording on getting the update now – that is not yet really valid and it wasn’t scheduled to be released until the update is out there. </p>

<p> This week at MWC, Intel revealed its 2015 and 2016 mobile chipset lineup, as well as the fact that the company is adopting a similar naming scheme to its Core line of processors with these new chips. They've been dubbed x3, x5, and x7, and as with the Core processors, bigger is generally better. </p>
<p> Intel has long been something of a dark horse in the mobile industry. The company has seen negligible penetration in smartphones to date (though not none) and competes almost exclusively in the low to mid-range segment in Android tablets. Of course, as the ultraportable market changes and small, super-thin laptops and convertibles become more common, Intel is swooping in with design wins left and right, keeping the likes of Qualcomm, NVIDIA, MediaTek, and Samsung out of a lucrative market. </p>

<p> Vivo's impressive gimbal camera system was first announced with the Apex 2020 concept phone in March this year but made its way into a handset people can buy soon after. The flagship series unveiled in China last month consisted of an X50, X50 Pro, and X50 Pro+. The priciest Pro+ model is still only available in China, but the other two are set to come to global markets over the coming months. </p>
<p> At the company's "5G Day" event in San Diego yesterday, Qualcomm announced that it had secured 18 OEM partners to build 5G devices using its new X50 5G modem in 2019. Notable among them are handset makers Nokia (HMD), Sony, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, HTC, LG, ASUS, and ZTE. Conspicuously absent at the time of this writing is Samsung, though the two companies did just announce a long-term cross-licensing agreement, so you'd have to think they were on track to build a phone with this new modem, too. </p>
<p> Other companies in the list can be found in the press release below, though most of the others are in the component or supply chain side of the business. </p>
<p> 5G is still a few years away for most of us, but networks and tech companies are laying the groundwork for it right now. One year ago, Qualcomm announced it was developing its first 5G-capable mobile modem, the X50. If you're not familiar with mobile SoCs, the modem is the component of a phone that connects to a cellular network. Qualcomm promised speeds of up to 5Gbps, with an expected ship date of 2018. </p>

<p> Remember back in December (and January) when Packt Publishing gave away a couple free ebooks focused on Android development? The one-a-day promotion has been going strong since, but the books haven't exactly been targeted at the OS on our phones. But great news: this whole week is dedicated to mobile development! </p>
<p> The current freebie is all about showing love to both sides of the phone war – it's Xamarin Cross-platform Application Development. But you better hurry over and claim it, this particular book will expire in just over 5 hours. (Sorry, we saw this one a little late). </p>
<p> While the free book is enough reason to drop by, there's something more interesting afoot in this promotion. </p>
<p> Microsoft makes a lot of apps for multiple platforms. It also makes a lot of tools that are used by other developers to build apps for multiple platforms. It only makes sense then that the company would be interested in buying Xamarin, one of the leading platform providers for mobile app development. </p>
<p> While you may not have heard of Xamarin, its solution counts as one of the invisible threads that play a role in running the Internet nowadays. The platform helps developers use a shared codebase in C# to build, test, and monitor native apps for iOS, Android, and Windows, all with the same IDE, language, and APIs. </p>

<p> Android Auto is pretty cool, but the requirement of an expensive headunit for your car (or a new car that shipped with Android Auto support) set the barrier of entry pretty high. Thankfully, Google added the ability to use the Android Auto interface on your phone last year. Still, if you want the full Android Auto experience, a compatible Sony head unit is currently $398 ($100 off) from select sites. </p>
<p> Android Auto is starting to pick up a little bit of steam, which is nice to see for us car audio nerds. Recently, Auto hit v2.0 which brought with it some changes, including an on-phone mode. For those of us who do not have a fancy new car that includes the smartphone connectivity, aftermarket headunits are our next best bet. That brings us to Sony's first dip into this particular arena, the XAV-AX100. Announced back in August, we only got some news about features. Well, now this bad boy is up for pre-order at $499. </p>
<p> Sony has a new Android Auto head unit - its first, actually - the catchily-named XAV-AX100. The main draw of the device seems to be the sound quality, with four "55-watt Dynamic Reality Amp 2" amplifiers and Sony's EXTRA BASS low-boost circuitry supposedly overcoming engine noise to deliver crystal clear sound. </p>
<p> On the Android side, Sony says the XAV-AX100 has Android Auto 2 installed. If you're not overly sure what that is, you're not alone. Maybe it's the things Google announced at I/O this year for Auto? That would include things like OK Google hotwording and OEM apps, but possibly the most important announcement, WiFi projection mode - which means the Android Auto connection from your phone to the head unit is wireless - is not mentioned in the blog post Sony published today. </p>

<p> GDC 2019 is next month, and in preparation for the event, the official schedule has been made available on the GDC Conference website. Notably, one of the sessions on the calendar is supposed to cover a first look at a new SDK from Microsoft that will allow mobile game developers to integrate the Xbox Live service into their titles. </p>
<p> Microsoft has already dabbled around with expanding the Xbox Live experience to mobile devices, but if a recent report from The Verge is to be believed, the company may be about to ramp up its efforts significantly. Our good friend Sources, who is familiar with Microsoft's plans, claims that Microsoft is building a platform that would extend Xbox Live functionality to Android and iOS. Instead of using Google Play Games or Apple's Game Center to track achievements, find other players, and compete with one another, you would be able to use Xbox Live instead. </p>
<p> Your contribution will have direct impact on how we win back our game developers from our competitors. </p>
<p> There's a startling amount of crossover between people who use Android for their mobile needs and Windows and Xbox for their desktop and console gaming. The SmartGlass app has been a definite hit for Xbox 360 users who also have Windows Phone 7 devices... all eight of them. Now Android users can join the fun: Microsoft's released the official SmartGlass app for Android, available for free in the Play Store. </p>
<p> If you're not familiar with SmartGlass, it controls just about every aspect of the media-friendly Xbox 360 aside from actual game control. The app will let your navigate though your Xbox's menu, pause and play music and videos, or even purchase new content right from your phone. </p>
<p> Well, this sure came out of left field. Microsoft has released an official Xbox LIVE app for Android! The app can be used to view and modify your 3D Xbox avatar, track your achievements, connect with Xbox LIVE friends, and even get news and information from the Xbox Spotlight feeds. Color us surprised at how fully featured this app is. </p>
<p> The app has a distinctly Metro UI feel to it, which is unsurprising as Redmond has been keen to slather the vector-based UI on all of its properties these days, but the theme definitely clashes with Android. Functionally, however, it's very robust. </p>
<p> After many weeks of speculations, Nokia and Microsoft finally announced minutes ago that the 2 companies are entering a strategic partnership "to build a new global mobile ecosystem." </p>
<p> Nokia has been struggling to keep up with the exploding smartphone market in the past years, and it was clear that something needed to be done. </p>
<p> MeeGo, Nokia's latest bet at replacing its aging Symbian system with a new, open sourced, Linux-based OS, has been in development since 2010, but no phones running this OS have been released by the company yet. </p>
<p> In an effort to regain market share, Nokia had to pick - either join forces with Android, a giant growing at incredible speeds, or side with the newcomer - Windows Phone 7 from Microsoft, a company Nokia can trust (their current CEO, Stephen Elop, spent almost 3 years as a Microsoft VP of BizDev). </p>

<p> If you're an Xbox Insider in the Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead rings in the US and UK, you can now start testing out Microsoft's Xbox Console Streaming service, which streams any Xbox One game to an Android device. The prerequisites for the service are a bit restrictive, but going through the steps will let you put in some Gear 5 gameplay during your work or school commute. </p>
<p> We've known since June that Microsoft was working on integrating Alexa and Google Assistant with Xbox in lieu of its own voice assistant, Cortana. With Alexa support already up and running on Xbox One, it's now time for Google Assistant to get in on the action. </p>
<p> Xbox One users, here's a piece news for you on Android Police, of all places. According to Windows Central, you may soon be able to control your gaming/entertainment console with voice commands, thanks to the addition of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant support. </p>
<p> Minecraft could be considered this generation's Doom - it runs on everything. Beyond the original Java-based game, there are versions for the Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, New 3DS, Nintendo Switch, Wii U, PS Vita, iOS, Android, Windows 10, Amazon Fire TV, and Apple TV. This is made even more confusing by some editions having different features. Minecraft's 'Better Together Update' is the first step in addressing the feature fragmentation and implementing cross-play support. </p>
<p> One of the major problems with Minecraft is the number of different editions, with varying level of multiplayer cross-play. This stems from different code bases - the console versions are based on the original Java game, while Pocket/Windows 10 Edition use the same C++ code base. But the upcoming Minecraft PE 1.2 update, nicknamed the 'Better Together Update,' aims to address this. </p>
<p> The Xbox 360 controller has been the de facto standard for years (NVIDIA copied it almost exactly for the SHIELD line), and the Xbox One has a refined and streamlined version of that design. So when Microsoft announced that a shiny new revision of the Xbox One controller would not only let you choose your colors and engraving Moto Maker-style, but also include a Bluetooth connection for easy dongle-free pairing with PCs, I couldn't help but get excited. Might Android gamers finally get access to the best controller around without any USB frippery or root-enabled work-arounds? </p>
<p> The Xbox Smartglass app has been available on Android for a while, letting users control the Xbox's media functions, such as play, pause, and menu navigation, directly through the app. Today, at Microsoft's E3 press conference, the app is getting a big update, being renamed to just 'Xbox' and with features comparable to the equivalent on Windows 10. With the app, you can use Xbox Live, buy games, or watch game content shared by other users, making it the ultimate companion to the Microsoft-made box sitting near your TV. </p>
<p> WHAT'S NEW </p>
<p> Updated home – The Activity Feed is the home of the Xbox app </p>
<p> Added Trending content – Find out what's popular on Xbox Live </p>
<p> Facebook friend finder – Add your Facebook friends who are also on Xbox </p>
<p> Contact list friend finder – Use your phones contact list to add friends to Xbox Live </p>
<p> Real name sharing – Be able to share your real name with your friends </p>
<p> Game hubs – Game Hubs now added to Xbox app </p>
<p> Updated profiles – Redesigned user profiles in Xbox app </p>
<p> The banner features of the update are mostly to do with Xbox Live, Microsoft's online gaming network. </p>
<p> Microsoft's SmartGlass app is a smartphone-based manager for the Xbox One, and it gets some surprisingly frequent love from the developers for a product intended for a direct Google competitor. The latest beta version is a significant bump, 2.4 to 3.16, though the changes aren't immediately obvious beyond a few cosmetic adjustments. The new user interface moves quite a few elements around, and if it isn't completely "material" then at least Microsoft is trying to make it look like an Android app instead of a tiny Xbox window. </p>
<p> Microsoft has pushed out an update to the SmartGlass beta app that lets users turn their Xbox One consoles on and off from their Android devices. This way you can start streaming content directly to your tablet without having to reach for a separate controller beforehand. </p>
<p> This update has also expanded the ability to stream live TV in 19 countries. Unfortunately the changelog doesn't list them, and the full list hasn't yet appeared on the Xbox TV Tuner's support page. </p>
<p> Microsoft's Xbox One SmartGlass Beta lets owners of the console try out a few new features before they reach the release version of the app. In the latest Beta update, SmartGlass gained two new options that must be exciting for Australian TV fans, and just one for Dutch users. </p>
<p> If you live in Australia, Xbox' OneGuide should now be functional for you. This TV guide shows the schedule for various Australian terrestrial channels, letting users browse the programming for a few days and maybe plan some of their entertainment accordingly. The more interesting news, however, is that Australia is getting the Xbox One Digital HD Tuner, now available for pre-order on the Microsoft Store for AU$39.95 with a release date slated for March. </p>

<p> The XDA forums are the capitol of all Android root/ROM development efforts these days, and from its multitudes of developers and endless pages of posts come most of the homebrew software that provides us with root access, liberates draconian device restrictions, and keeps older phones ticking. Android enthusiasts aren't the only ones making use of the software there, though. Turkish OEM General Mobile recently rolled out its own Android Q beta program for two of its phones even though it isn't among the manufacturers Google lists as participating in these early Q tests. </p>
<p> Most Android enthusiasts have probably heard of XDA Developers. And if you're reading this post, then you're likely interested in what their Forums and Portal offer in terms of new customizations, development advances, and more. But if you don't want to use the full XDA app with the entire forum experience, and you'd prefer to just have the important news from the different device sub-forums reach you instead of having to dig for new threads here and there, then this new XDA Feed beta app might be the thing for you. </p>
<p> It gives a customized feed for certain devices (or a general feed for all other phones) of the latest news coming from XDA. </p>
<p> Anyway, this super duper new app differs from the previous legacy app in the fact that it's coded in-house and based on XDA APIs, not on Tapatalk. </p>

<p> xe19.1 </p>
<p> The Google Glass developers are at it again; they keep coming up with new ways to burn through that tiny battery. Today, the Glass Development Kit changelog was updated to detail the addition of USB webcam support for developers looking to add access to views outside of the standard forward-facing perspective. Webcams must be attached via On-The-Go (OTG) cable, and Plug 'n Play isn't supported, so Glass must be rebooted before the attached camera can be recognized. </p>
<p> A minor OTA update is now rolling out to the small population of people who happen to own Google Glass. This release, XE19.1, brings improved network connectivity, so Glass should now do a better job of handling spotty network issues when issuing voice commands. This is good considering how much Google's voice search relies on the web. </p>
<p> XE19.1 also brings in a slight visual revamp, as Glass now has a cleaner look for voice actions. </p>

<p> XE5 </p>
<p> Man, Google Glass moves at the speed of light. This is crazy. </p>
<p> The big XE5 update just hit the interwebs, so that means it's time for a teardown! XE5 is still Android 4.0.4 based, but now we're up to build 4.0.4-665738; the old version was 4.0.4-625737. </p>
<p> The Glass Team is still extraordinarily messy; any new file usually has copies in a million different locations. Basically, everything ships in every APK. </p>
<p> Have you tried finding a Glass system dump? It's impossible. A Google search turns up the same thing, over and over again: Me, talking about system dumps or begging for one. </p>
<p> So, to rectify this great injustice of the Internet (and because people keep asking me, personally) we've decided to hit you up with the Glass system dump. The Explorer program seems to be all about hacking and experimentation, so hopefully Google adopts an open policy towards posting Glass code. </p>
<p> Wow. So when Glass was first making the rounds, we heard a few rumblings about a ridiculously fast update cycle; something like monthly updates. Sure enough, it seems like Google is delivering on that sort-of rumored promise: </p>
<p> Today, less than a month after the Glass unit left Google HQ, there's a new update: Version XE5. There's no public change log, but Phandroid says they emailed Google and got back the following list: </p>
<p> New features in XE5: </p>
<p> Change to sync policy: require power + wifi for background uploads </p>
<p> Crash reporting </p>
<p> Incoming G+ notifications (direct shares, comments, +mentions), including ability to comment and +1 </p>
<p> Incoming Hangout notifications </p>
<p> Transcription of queries & messages is now wicked-fast </p>
<p> Long-press to search from anywhere in the UI (no longer just from off) </p>
<p> International number dialing + SMS </p>
<p> New On-Head Detection calibration flow </p>
<p> Show device Serial Number on Device Info card </p>
<p> More reliable estimation of battery charge remaining </p>
<p> New recipient-list mosaic </p>
<p> Google+ integration sounds awesome; the only problem is it doesn't actually work right now. </p>

<p> XFINITY TV GO </p>
<p> The Xfinity TV Go is Comcast's way of letting customers take some of the channels they're already paying for and stream them to an Android device. For something that doesn't cost extra—thankfully, considering the high price of cable—it's a nice perk. Comcast has recently brought the list of supported channels up to over 70 with the addition of AMC, BBC America, FOX Deportes, MOVIEPLEX, Showtime, Univision Deportes, and The Weather Channel. The full list is available to browse through online. </p>
<p> For people who have a Comcast cable subscription, the Xfinity TV Go app is quite the nice piece of software. Rather than just providing shows for immediate streaming, which is less groundbreaking these days than it used to be, Comcast provides quite a few channels for live streaming. Now many more networks are available, including A&E, Cooking Channel, DIY, Food Network, HGTV, History Channel, MUN2 (companion to Telemundo), Sprout, Starz, TBS, TRUtv, TNT, and the Travel Channel. </p>
<p> Comcast's XFINITY app has undergone a name change with its latest update, and it now only answers when referred to as XFINITY TV Go. Does the latest version, in fact, make TV go? If we're referring to live content, then the answer's yes. Comcast customers with an Android device or two lying around can now stream the news, sports, kids shows, and other content live. </p>
<p> Live streaming works on both cellular and Wi-Fi data, which means you are not tied to your own home network as was the case with some apps in the past. </p>

<p> XGIMI MoGo </p>
<p> Summer is here, which means kicking off your shoes, relaxing outdoors, and exploring new places... hopefully while still social distancing. If you want to take your entertainment with you on the go, a portable projector is a great all-in-one solution, but you need something that's bright, works well with a remote, supports apps, and has some decent sound. Those are all qualities I enjoyed about the Xgimi projectors when I reviewed them last year, and now three of the brands' models are discounted up to 25% as Amazon's deals of the day. </p>
<p> Portable projectors have been the fantasy of entertainment enthusiasts for decades. Over the past years, the image quality, tech, and price have become better and more reasonable, but most devices either run a sloppy OS or don't run one at all. If you want a TV-centric platform on your portable projector, you should consider this XGIMI MoGo projector, which comes with Android TV and is now down from $400 to $340 on Amazon. </p>
<p> Until recently, most portable projectors either ran no software at all, relying on HDMI and USB for input, or offered a regular version of Android that wasn't suited for TVs or navigation with a remote. Then Anker's Nebula Capsule II launched with Android TV and the game changed drastically. It was the first projector to provide a seamless experience thanks to an optimized interface made specifically for TVs and official access to the Play Store. </p>
<p> XGIMI, a projector maker, is now dipping its toes in the same market with the new MoGo. With Android TV, Google Assistant, Harman Kardon audio, 210 ANSI Lumens, and an appealing price tag, the MoGo has everything going for it, but you should keep an eye open for a few quirks. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/10/19/xiaomi-announces-ridiculous-80w-wireless-charging-technology/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17484001" filename="xiaomi-announces-ridiculous-80w-wireless-charging-technology">
<p> Fast charging has been one of the key battlegrounds in the smartphone wars in recent years, and Xiaomi has often been at the forefront. Last year, the Chinese OEM announced that it was working on a 100W wired charger that could fully fill a 4,000mAh battery in just 17 minutes. It's now going one step further with 80W Mi Wireless Charging that takes almost as little time to do the same job sans wires. </p>
<p> If that sounds insane, that's because it is. Most phones with wireless charging support somewhere between 10 and 15W. The OnePlus 8 Pro made a big deal out of its 30W wireless charging, and both Huawei's P40 Pro+ and Oppo's Reno Ace can do 40W. Xiaomi's own Mi 10 Ultra wirelessly charges at 50W, which is already very fast, but this new 80W solution would blow that out of the water. </p>
<p> According to Xiaomi, its next-generation tech can take a 4,000mAh battery from 0-100% in around 19 minutes. It reaches 10% in 1 minute and 50% in just eight minutes. The company's 30W wireless charging takes 25 minutes to go to 50% and 69 minutes to reach 100%, so this is a substantial improvement. Wireless power has long been deemed more convenient than plugging in, but it's always been slower and less efficient. With these kinds of speeds, we can expect to see portless phones become the norm sooner rather than later. </p>

<p> On many Android devices, Google Search lets you view tons of 3D models like animals, pets, skeletons, cells, Neil Armstrong's spacesuit, and much more. With the tap of a button, you can move these objects into your home and see them as though they were in your camera's viewfinder. It's even possible to snap photos and take videos. The list of supported phones is ever-expanding — devices like the Sony Xperia 1 II, the Poco X2, the Xiaomi Redmi K30, and Samsung's Galaxy Tab S6 Lite made the cut we when checked in at the beginning of June, and now a few more are popping up, including the flagship Galaxy S20 series. </p>

<p> The popular Energy Ring app, which gives you a pretty ingenious and fun battery indicator around the so-called "punch-hole" camera cutout, was just updated with support for twelve new phones, including two technically unreleased ones.

<p> xiaomi mi 6 </p>
<p> A long time coming at this point, but Oreo is rolling out to Xiaomi's early-2017 flagship. In addition to the Android version bump, this update brings along a whole slew of new features, fixes, and optimizations – all under MIUI 9 – for the Mi 6. </p>
<p> Xiaomi has an interesting history that I recommend you read up on if you don’t already know it. The company, while known to mostly enthusiasts here in the States, has a huge presence in its homeland China, as well as India and other parts of Southeast Asia. Despite a general decline in size and influence in the past year or two, Xiaomi continues to push the envelope of affordable, feature-packed phones. The Mi line represents the best that the manufacturer has to offer. For 2017, Xiaomi has created the Mi 6, a small phone full of the latest and greatest specs. </p>
<p> As great as LineageOS and other ROMs are, they wouldn't be possible without a custom recovery available for the device. TWRP is usually pretty quick to support new devices, with older phones and tablets being added to the list frequently too. Since our last post, TWRP has added support for 17 more devices, including the LeEco Le Pro 3 and Xiaomi Mi 6. </p>
<p> After a lot of speculation, leaks, and plenty of teasing, Xiaomi has officially unveiled its latest flagship, the Mi 6. The Chinese company packed in some top-tier specs into a small-bodied, glass sandwich phone, with an attractive price to boot. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi 8 Explorer Edition </p>
<p> A few months back, Xiaomi attracted attention for the transparent Xiaomi Mi 8 Explorer Edition. Of course, it wasn't all positive attention. The phone has an improbable window on the back with components neatly arranged in a grid. We were skeptical from the start because that's not how real circuit boards look, and now a picture of the actual component confirms this is just a fake model of a PCB. </p>
<p> Xiaomi announced some new phones today, which I'm sure will sell in huge numbers (just not in the US). Among the new devices was the Xiaomi Mi 8 Explorer Edition. This phone is like the regular M8 except it has a transparent glass back that shows off suspiciously pretty internal components. Really, there's a little Snapdragon logo on what purports to be the SoC. This could all be smoke and mirrors. </p>

<p> Xiaomi Mi A1 </p>
<p> A couple of months ago, my brother in law came to me with a question: he needed an affordable $200-300 Android smartphone that he could purchase from the UAE or Lebanon and that would do the basics right. My ready-made answer in the category in the past few years has been Samsung's A/C/J series. You get nice hardware, decent software with less bloat nowadays, excellent after-sale support no matter which mom-and-pop repair store you stop at, easy accessory purchase, and it's super fast to sell it on when the time comes to part with your phone. But that's only because Samsung's presence in Lebanon is huge, LG's midrange devices are too costly for the features, Moto and HTC essentially don't exist, Nokia/HMD hadn't begun selling phones again yet, and Huawei started breaking into the market about a year or so ago. </p>
<p> Xiaomi's mixed record for releasing kernel sources continues, as the company has still not posted sources for the Mi A1. While Xiaomi has previously stated their internal goal for releasing kernels is "within three months," according to XDA-Developers, the Mi A1 is well past this mark, as it was released last September. With the apparent end of the Nexus device program, the Mi A1 would be a prime candidate for custom ROM development, in place of the 2+ year old Nexus 5X. </p>
<p> The Mi A1 was the first Android One device from Xiaomi, meaning it ran completely stock Android. It turned out to be an excellent phone, and Xiaomi promised it would receive Oreo before the end of 2017. It looks like the company just barely delivered on that promise, because Android 8.0 is now rolling out to the device. </p>
<p> Team Win Recovery Project, or TWRP for short, is just about the only custom recovery worth using in 2017. It does everything most people need, works on a massive number of devices, and can be themed. The last time we covered TWRP, it added support for the Pixel 2 and a few other phones. Now the recovery is officially available for some of ASUS' new phones, and Xiaomi's first Android One device. </p>
<p> Xiaomi phones always have the same problem. While the company's devices have generally great specifications and design for the price, the software experience is usually not very good. If you've read one of our Xiaomi device reviews, or used one of the company's phones yourself, you probably know what I'm talking about. </p>
<p> All of Xiaomi's phones and tablets ship with MIUI, a heavily modified version of Android that has countless problems. Some of these include Bluetooth connectivity bugs, terrible notification handling, and over-the-top power management that can outright break notifications for many apps. Jordan went in depth about MIUI's issues here, if you're interested in details. </p>
<p> We haven't heard a lot from Android One lately, but it seems that the program is catching on in several countries like Japan and Turkey. You can add India to that list, as well as several dozens other countries thanks to the announcement of the new Xiaomi Mi A1. </p>
<p> Xiaomi had teased a new "flagship dual camera" on Twitter a few days ago, and just like the rumors predicted, this is the Mi A1, the latest Android One (A1, geddit?) phone. And I have to say, Xiaomi pulled all the stops there. It's an impressive device for an impressive little price. </p>

<p> xiaomi mi a3 </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/08 7:16am PDTon Apr 8, 2020 and last updated 2020/05/08 2:33am PDTon May 8, 2020. </p>
<p> You would think that Android One phones are usually among the first to get new OS releases, but many Nokia devices and the Xiaomi Mi A3 prove this wrong, as a lot of them still run Android 9 to this day. That's bound to change for the Mi A3, though, as Xiaomi has started to roll out Android 10 to the handset. </p>
<p> Google is always hard at work on adding ARCore support to new devices. This time around, those include the brand-new Note10 and 10+, but other than that, a bigger shift has occurred on the company's AR front – that is, if you count marketing and naming schemes as big shifts. The catchy ARCore Play Store listing makes way for the cumbersome phrase "Google Play Service for AR." The change has already been visible for a while, but the company only introduced the new name in the app's changelog last week, along with announcing support for 60fps rendering on capable devices. </p>
<p> Xiaomi's first stock Android device was the Mi A1, released back in 2017. It was a very good phone, especially for the low price of ~$230, and the company released a sequel last year. There wasn't much doubt that a Mi A3 was on the way, but now we have the first pictures of the device. </p>

<p> Xiaomi / MIUI </p>
<p> In China, Xiaomi's custom Android interface MIUI 11 has been in beta since last month, and now the company is ready to deploy its software to more locations internationally. The MIUI India Twitter account posted an animation featuring the new interface along with the date October 16. We can expect the international version of the UI to start rolling out then. </p>
<p> MIUI, one of Android's most popular custom ROM flavors, has been limited to purely software for existing devices... until today. Made by a Chinese company Xiaomi which has been in charge of MIUI's software development, the MIUI phone was just announced in China (where Xiaomi is based), and I must say - it's no hush puppy and leaves us highly impressed. </p>
<p> First and foremost, the MI-ONE, or Millet, sports a whopping 1.5GHz dual-core MSM8260 Scorpion CPU (from the 3rd generation Snapdragon family). </p>
<p> Dissecting the beefy specs further, we find the Adreno220 GPU, 4GB of ROM and 1GB of RAM, a 4" Sharp screen (854x480 - not qHD), 8MP rear camera, and a juicy 1930mAh battery. </p>

<p> xiaomi redmi 9 </p>
<p> While flagships are getting ever more expensive, midrange and entry-level phones are giving us ever better hardware at the same affordable prices. The Xiaomi Redmi 9 is no exception and offers great value at €150 (or ₹10,000 as the Redmi 9 Prime in India). If Xiaomi had invested more in a better processor and less in the heavily-marketed but poorly executed quad-camera setup, I could recommend this phone with no reservations. As it stands, this phone is still a good option for some people. </p>
<p> Xiaomi introduced a plethora of products in an online-only event today, including the much-leaked Mi TV Stick and a new pair of wireless earbuds, but the company also launched a new lineup of budget phones, the Redmi 9 series. It consists of three devices costing between €100 and €170, the Redmi 9, the Redmi 9A, and the Redmi 9C. They all come with 6.53-inch screens and are powered by MediaTek silicon. </p>

<p> xiaomi redmi note 4 </p>
<p> The most popular custom ROM available, LineageOS, keeps on getting better and better. Since we last covered the project, two more devices are now supported, and a number of great features have been added. The project recently posted a new changelog, highlighting recent improvements and device changes: </p>
<p> We already covered the TWRP 3.1.0 update, which brings several new features and bug fixes to the massively-popular custom recovery. TWRP is also expanding official support to several new devices, including the HTC U Ultra and Xiaomi Mi Max. </p>
<p> Straight after the global release of MIUI 8, Xiaomi is back with its newest device: the Redmi Note 4. Featuring a 5.5-inch 1080p display with 2.5D curved glass, a 4100mAh battery, and a full metal unibody design with chamfered edges, it's pretty clear the Chinese consumer electronics company is hoping that this one will be a big seller. </p>
<p> Other specifications include a 10-core MediaTek Helio X20 processor with clock speeds up to 2.1GHz, an 'ultra-fast' fingerprint scanner, and a 13MP f2.0 camera. 16GB will cost ￥899 ($135), while the 64GB model will cost a wallet-clenching ￥1199 ($180). It also has expandable storage through a hybrid SIM/storage tray, supporting up to 128GB microSD cards. </p>

<p> xkcd </p>
<p> Google has been using CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA for years now to crowdsource information from images it has found online. On the one side, you prove to Google you're a human, on the other, Google gets humans to see small images of text from a book, numbers on a house, or various objects and animals and provide OCR for the text and numbers plus logical grouping and categorization for the objects/animals. </p>
<p> That's the main dig that XKCD's comic today is based on. It's a CAPTCHA but it's asking the user to say if there's a stop sign, just so it can properly use that data to control its self-driving vehicle. </p>
<p> Many of you have probably seen yesterday's XKCD comic about the laughably terrible state of volume controls on mobile devices. The issue is particularly bad in Android apps, and developers really need to do something about it. Quite honestly, it's embarrassing that this is still a problem in 2017. </p>
<p> As I'm sure many of you know, Android has three distinct 'volumes' - one for media, one for the ringer, and one for alarms. Each has its own volume level, but unless you're playing media, adjusting the volume just changes the ringer - leading to the problem XKCD nailed in today's comic. </p>
<p> Every developer has gone through a long afternoon of making a bunch of tiny changes to their app, rebuilding and running it, then repeating the same steps just to get back to a point where they can test the changes they just made. Forget it, those days are done! Android Studio 2.0 just hit the Canary channel and its headlining feature allows you to push changes from your computer to an app while it's running and see results right away. Also joining the latest release is a brand new GPU Profiler tool that can make OpenGL ES development significantly easier. </p>
<p> Instant Run </p>
<p> The Instant Run feature has been mentioned previously during Google I/O 2015, but it has been under wraps until now. </p>
<p> In the grand scheme of the Internet, alt texts don't really matter. FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT, WHATCHA TALKIN' 'BOUT? I mean, they're only little blurbs of text that show up when you hover over an image on the web. YOUR MOM IS A BLURB. Usually, they're just the file name of the image or some insignificant gibberish tacked by WordPress or whatever online publishing tool the website you're visiting uses. THAT'S A BUNCH OF FJAFJKLDSKF7JKFDJ! I mean, in almost all cases, they don't add anything to what you're seeing. STOP USING APPROXIMATIONS. Ok, </p>
<p> Following on the success of the original xkcd Phone (which featured a blend of Android and iOS, a side-facing camera, and the ability to scream when falling), a successor has arrived that offers some of the best tech that 2014 has to offer. </p>
<p> The xkcd Phone 2 includes a revolutionary always-on front-facing speaker, which the phone will use to automatically cry when lost. With a built-in, ribbed, auto-rotating case made of 3D materials, the handset should feel comfortable in any hand size. And in a year where phones argued that HD wasn't HD enough, the xkcd Phone 2's MaxHD display competes by cramming over 350 pixels onto its screen (and doubling as a cheek toucher). </p>
<p> Too bad xkcd doesn't have a crappy app we could make fun of. That guy thought of everything! </p>

<p> X-Mas </p>
<p> The creators of such marvels as My Beach and Celtic Garden, DualBoot Games, have outdone themselves this holiday season with Christmas HD - what I believe to be the most intricate live wallpaper I've seen on Android in a long time (ever?). </p>
<p> Customizable lights, gifts, tree topper, snowflakes, garlands, and a Christmas countdown are just the tip of the iceberg. Wait till you see your own photo above the fireplace, your family's names embroiled on the stockings, and a note to Santa signed by the same guy or gal who's looking back at you in the mirror every morning. </p>
<p> Just as promised, Rovio, the maker of the oh-so-popular Angry Birds, released a separate game called Angry Birds Seasons today, which contains 45 Halloween levels, previously only available on iOS, as well as 25 Christmas levels. </p>
<p> I haven't spotted any new birds yet, and I doubt they've added any, but I'm sure a few hours later, when you all finish every level, you will let us know. Oops, I take that back - the snow levels are available one per day, starting today, all the way through December 25th (see the last screenshot to see what happens if you try to click on day 2). </p>
<p> Rovio, the maker of Angry Birds, one of the most successful franchises to hit mobile gaming, is slowly starting to spread into our daily lives outside of our mobile devices. No, I'm not talking about all the Halloween awesomeness that we've been seeing today: </p>
<p> I am talking about the official Angry Birds plush toys that just dropped for pre-order. These furry little things are produced by Commonwealth Toys and come in 5 different versions. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/xoom/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17483924" filename="xoom">
<p> This story was originally published 2019/12/20 7:39am PSTon Dec 20, 2019 and last updated 2020/05/23 9:07am PDTon May 23, 2020. </p>
<p> Android's been around quite a while at this point (Google's Android turned 12 last year), and even Android phones have been around well over a decade now. And while obviously hardware like the HTC Hero matters in terms of where the platform got its start, and ones like the original Moto DROID mark its real entry into the marketplace in a big way, we think there are phones (and even A tablet) that are less remembered or less appreciated for their impact on the larger ecosystem. </p>
<p> After, when's the last time you thought of the Galaxy S2, or the HTC One M7? </p>
<p> It takes a lot of applications to build an ecosystem. Google has all the essentials down — email, calendar, contacts, productivity applications, and so on — but the company has always struggled with creative tools. Most notably, Google is still lacking a proper video editor for its own operating systems, which is becoming even more of an issue as high-end Chromebooks gain momentum. </p>
<p> Although development of Android for tablets has largely stagnated, mid-range media consumption tablets are still cheaply produced. The AT&T Moto Tab (stylized as 'moto tab') is technically Motorola's first tablet since the Xoom 2 (known as the Xyboard in the United States), though the design strongly resembles that of the Lenovo Tab 4 10. You can now buy the Moto Tab from AT&T for $299.99 upfront, or for $15/month for 20 months. This is $120 more than the Lenovo-branded tablet, though the two share more similarities in appearance than power. </p>
<p> Yesterday PayPal updated its Android app to take advantage of Xoom, a service that allows you to transfer money internationally. PayPal acquired Xoom back in 2015 and only began integrating Xoom's features into its own services late last year. With Xoom users can send money to people in over 62 countries via a few different means, including topping up prepaid phones. Anyone who may be regularly sending cash to friends or family abroad will likely welcome the new Xoom integration. </p>
<p> Of all the Android ROMs out there, few receive even a fraction of the love that CyanogenMod does. For users that like to flash ROMs and experiment with all Android has to offer, getting official Cyanogen support can be like Christmas morning. Today users of the HTC One XL and the old Verizon Motorola XOOM get to do a little happy dance as CyanogenMod 10.1 nightlies have become available for the XOOM, while an experimental build is up for the One XL. </p>
<p> Definition: A "nightly" is a bleeding edge release that is built on a daily basis, usually at night after a full day's worth of new code has been committed. </p>
<p> Don't you just love when your device gets a new version of CM? It's like getting an update from the Android gods, because who knows when the manufacturer/carrier is going to send one out. </p>
<p> Today, four new devices are added to the CM10.1 list: </p>
<p> XOOM Wi-Fi (wingray) </p>
<p> XOOM 3G (everest) Note: Not compatible with the Verizon variant! </p>
<p> Samsung Fascinate (fascinatemtd) </p>
<p> ...and a newcomer to the scene, the ODROID-U2 (odroidu2) </p>
<p> That's excellent news for the owners of those devices, but we're sure there's one question on everyone's mind here: what the hell is an ODROID-U2? We wondered the same, but a little digging turned up the answer: it's an Exynos4412 dev platform with a couple gigs of RAM and a Mali-400 GPU. </p>
<p> Earlier this evening, CyanogenMod's Google+ page published an announcement that read "Who says Everest is in Nepal?". That's right – the Motorola Xoom 3G (GSM) variant has joined the list of CM-supported devices, getting its first experimental build dated 10-17. </p>
<p> Steady Hawkin, in a comment to the announcement, notes that the experimental build is "still a WIP," and encourages users to report any issues they may encounter. </p>
<p> If you're a Xoom GSM owner looking for some CM10 action, just keep an eye on the CyanogenMod download center's Everest page (linked below) for the latest builds. As CM's announcement notes, mountaineers need not apply. </p>
<p> Well, that was fast. Android 4.1.2 was just released to AOSP last week, and Motorola has already started pushing the Wi-Fi XOOM's update out to soak testers. This isn't a huge jump in terms of functionality, and the incremental update will bump the XOOM from build JRO03H (4.1.1) to JZO54K (4.1.2). </p>
<p> Of course, those who aren't soak testers are probably wondering how they can get this update now. The beauty of Google-supported hardware like the Wi-FI XOOM (which is, for all intents and purposes a Nexus device), is that Big G makes updates likes this one available almost immediately. Therefore, it can be downloaded and manually applied right now. </p>
<p> In a post to Google's Android Building group today, Jean-Baptiste Queru once again acted as the bearer of good tidings for developers and tweakers everywhere, announcing that "a new set of proprietary binaries for Jelly Bean are available." </p>
<p> The new batch of binaries includes those of the Nexus S and Nexus S 4G (Crespo and Crespo4G respectively), the latter of which we just recently saw added into the AOSP fold. </p>
<p> The set also includes updates to the both the GSM Galaxy Nexus (maguro), and Verizon's Galaxy Nexus (toro, which itself is ever so close to full AOSP support). </p>
<p> Conspicuously absent from the party is Sprint's variant of the Galaxy Nexus, but there's no surprise there. </p>
<p> Update 7/26/12: It looks like the JRO03H update was final after all and has now started rolling out to everyone. Grab your XOOM and taste some Jelly Bean (thanks, @Fdiazreal and @iphilluv). </p>
<p> The Wi-Fi XOOM Jelly Bean update is almost here - after a brief delay it's finally rolling out to a limited group of soak testers who volunteer to provide feedback and test release candidates early. If all goes well, we should expect a wide release probably in the next few days, although if you're feeling brave, you can attempt to flash the update zip over your stock IMM76 build using a USB-OTG cable and these instructions. </p>

<p> Google Play Games doesn't get much attention these days, but that doesn't mean there haven't been some changes. We're wrapping together everything that's different in the last few versions, plus touching on some new things that are coming in the future. </p>

<p> xperia 2 </p>
<p> We've come to high season for high-pressure presentations in cavernous venues for little pieces of circuitry encased in glass, metal, and plastic again. IFA 2019 is just about underway in Berlin and tech companies are on rehearsals looking for the right words, notes, camera shots, and switches to hit. Unfortunately for Sony, someone in the control room flipped the wrong switch and briefly revealed the existence of the company's next big smartphone, the Xperia 5. </p>
<p> Sony is one of the few Android OEMs that still updates its flagship phone twice a year. Before prices can even come down on one Sony phone, there's a newer model. We expect Sony to replace the still very new Xperia 1 at IFA with the Xperia 2, and a handful of leaked images provide a sneak peek at that device. Spoiler: it looks like the Xperia 1. </p>

<p> Good news, Xperia Play, neo, and arc owners: the worlds greatest custom ROM, CyanogenMod, is coming soon to a device near you! Thanks to some newly submitted code, support for these devices can be expected to hit the CyanogenMod repositories soon, and nightlies will be available shortly after that. </p>
<p> Just a few days ago Sony Ericsson confirmed an early off-contract August launch for the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc. And now, on the eve of August, the official Sony Ericsson Online store launched a page allowing customers to pre-order the Android 2.3 device for $599.99 with an expected shipping date of 2 August. It is also possible to obtain an 18-month extended warranty for an additional $99.99. </p>
<p> Alternatively, for a better deal head over to Newegg.com </p>
<p> Once again, we find that the selection of Android phones available to those in Canada is increasing both in size and quality. The next two additions to that ever-growing range of devices available in the Great White North are to be the Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY and arc. According to a press release from Best Buy Canada, as of April 28th, these two great new handsets will be available on Rogers. </p>
<p> Thanks to the hardworking devs over at the XDA-Developers forum, the Xperia arc(sic) has been rooted. The pair responsible for the breakthrough, Bin4ry and zdzihu, released the how-to info early this morning (or late last night for you insomniacs). It seems like a pretty simple process: Unlock the bootloader, download Bin4ry's file, and flash it with fastboot. </p>
<p> This currently only applies to the UK version of the device, but it is expected to be ready for phones running the global firmware sometime tonight. </p>
<p> What better way for Sony to promote its newest line of Xperia Arc smartphones than by hiring the little (big) green robot to dance? This Android has some pretty slick dance moves, giving a whole new meaning to the phrase "doing the robot". </p>
<p> Sit back, turn up the volume, and check out this awesome video: </p>
<p> If rumors are to be believed, NEC's newest Android phone - the MEDIAS E-04C - will be the world's thinnest smartphone at 7.7mm when it launches this Thursday. It has only been a short time since Sony Ericsson launched the razor-thin Xperia arc and Samsung crowned its Galaxy S II phone as the "world's thinnest smartphone," but at 8.7mm and 8.49mm at their thinnest points, respectively, these phones look positively obese in comparison. </p>
<p> A couple of weeks ago at CES 2011, Sony Ericsson announced its latest Android handset - the sleek and sexy Gingerbread-running Xperia Arc. They've also invited the press, Android Police included, to attend a media breakfast where we ended up spending over an hour of quality time with the new device, documented in great detail here. If you have questions about the Arc, I highly recommend you dive into the above post, as it contains a plethora of useful bits and pieces, all wrapped in a convenient package. </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson posted profits of 35 million euros ($47.14 million) in Q4 of 2010, due largely to major downsizing combined with a shift towards Android-based smartphones. Although Sony Ericsson sold fewer phones overall, Android enthusiasts will be happy to hear that they managed to sell over 9 million Android-based Xperia phones, including the X10, X10 Mini, X10 Pro, and X8, since their launch. </p>
<p> In the last year, Sony has made significant changes after reporting losses of 836 million euros in 2009 ($1.13 billion). </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson has announced its first of a "new generation" of Xperia smartphones, christened the Xperia arc. The super-slim device measures 8.7 mm at its thinnest point and weighs just 117 grams. It packs: </p>
<p> 1GHz Qualcomm processor </p>
<p> 4.2" 854 x 480 display </p>
<p> 8.1 MP camera (with HD video recording and LED flash) </p>
<p> 8GB microSD (upgradeable to 32GB) </p>
<p> FM radio, Bluetooth, and GPS </p>
<p> Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) </p>
<p> Engadget managed to spend some time with the Xperia arc, and they highlighted the fact that it's "really thin." </p>

<p> Xperia owners, watch out. Lollipops are raining from the sky and smashing straight into your screens. If you welcome this phenomenon, don't do anything. These lollipops have heat-seeking sensors and will find your devices wherever they lay. If you prefer KitKat, you can swat the intruders away, but you'll never get to experience the future changes in store for your Android device. </p>
<p> Sony has confirmed that it is launching lollipops at Xperia Z3, Z3 Compact, and Z3 Tablet Compact devices all over the world (some of these updates were previously pushed out to smaller, test markets). </p>
<p> Sony is boasting its new Xperia C3 as the best smartphone for taking selfies thanks to its wide-angle 5MP front-facing "PROselfie" camera, soft LED flash, and a set of quirky apps. Hey, scoff all you want, but this is a big deal. Selfie is a real word now, and if I have to write about the subject seriously, the least you can do is read this with a straight face. </p>

<p> xperia e1 </p>
<p> Sony has shared in a blog post the beginning of its KitKat rollout for the Xperia E1 and E1 Dual. The update will include the usual goodies that come with Android 4.4 along with some changes to Sony's exclusive software. The company has provided a changelog of what to expect, and it's identical to the one it posted for the Xperia T2 Ultra. </p>
<p> To briefly recap what may soon hit an Xperia device near you, this update contains a tweaked status bar, revisions to quick settings, a theme that matches that of the PlayStation 4, and an improved ability to move files from internal memory to a micro SD card. </p>
<p> Two new devices are being added to the Xperia family today in the form of the Xperia E1 and Xperia T2 Ultra. These phones sit below flagship devices like the Z1 and Z1 Ultra, but they still have that slick Sony design and the OEM's custom build of Android 4.3. </p>

<p> xperia e3 </p>
<p> Sony hasn't always been the best at updating its phones, but the company does have a commitment to AOSP unlike most others. It contributes a lot of code to Android, and developers are encouraged to tinker with unlocked devices. In fact, Sony has just announced support for AOSP on the Xperia E3 and Xperia T3, meaning all Qualcomm-based phones from 2014 can run pure Android with very little hassle. </p>
<p> Here at IFA 2014 in Berlin, Sony is announcing new entries to its Xperia smartphone line at all levels. The flagship Z series, last updated only six months ago at Mobile World Congress, has been bolstered with the Xperia Z3. This device is the tip top of Sony's line, though in terms of sheer hardware it's an evolution rather than a revolution. The 5.2-inch 1080p screen, Snapdragon 801 processor (bumped up to 2.5Ghz), and 20.7MP rear camera are similar to the last iteration, but the body is much thinner at 7.3mm. </p>

<p> xperia ear </p>
<p> We've known about the Sony Xperia Ear since February when it was announced at MWC along with 3 other prototype projects. At the time, Sony said it was coming late in the summer, but the date was later postponed to November, and here we are. The Xperia Ear is now available for pre-order exclusively on the Xperia Store online in Europe. It'll cost GBP 179 in the UK and EUR 199 in France, Spain, Germany, and other European countries. </p>
<p> So what's the Xperia Ear? It's a Bluetooth headset, but it's not made for music as much as it's a personal assistant living inside your ear. </p>
<p> An ongoing issue with smartphones is that they pull people out of the world around them. Instead of interacting with others face-to-face or being aware of our surroundings, we increasingly spend our time tapping out tiny screens. </p>
<p> During Mobile World Congress, Sony announced a series of concept devices aimed at alleviating this issue. The idea is to keep us connected in a way that doesn't require staring down at a screen. Products include an earpierce, a clip-on camera, a projector, and a tiny robot. Only the first, the Xperia Ear, is coming out this year. </p>
<p> Today at MWC, Sony announced four new connected gadgets which it hopes will let people look up from their phone screens more and engage the world around them. The products include a bluetooth earpiece, a wearable camera, a vertical projector, and a friendly robot, which are respectively called the Xperia Ear, Xperia Eye, Xperia Projector, and Xperia Agent. </p>
<p> Three of those products are actually just concepts: only the Xperia Ear has an expected launch date, and it won't come out until later this summer. The remaining products — the Eye, Projector, and Agent — are nowhere to be seen here at MWC and it will likely take some time for them to get to market, if they do at all. </p>

<p> xperia ion </p>
<p> Sony has handed out Jelly Bean to a number of devices in the past month, but it has taken a while for the update to reach the Xperia Ion. That's now changing. Build number 6.2.B.0.211 has started to roll out to the device that, until now, was missing out on all the fun that its Xperia siblings were having. </p>
<p> Despite the wait, this is not an over-the-air update. Owners need access to a computer and the Sony PC Companion to update their device. </p>
<p> Good news for Sony fans: the company is finally starting to roll out Jelly Bean updates to some of its more notable 2012 smartphones. The former headliner Xperia S, its brother the SL, and the camera-focused SL all have Android 4.1 waiting for them. Users will need the a Windows PC and the Sony PC Companion to download and install the updated software, which includes a refreshed kernel as well. </p>
<p> I suppose you have to give Sony credit for at least keeping its customers informed. Today, the manufacturer announced an update to its plans for bringing its phones up to Jelly Bean. If you're rocking the Xperia T, Xperia TX, or Xperia V, you should see Android 4.1 "during February and March." Of course, this will depend on what market you're in or which variant you own. </p>
<p> Following those flagships, the Xperia P, Xperia J and Xperia go will start to receive their upgrades starting around the end of March. </p>
<p> Getting tired of running the stock OS on your Xperia Ion? If so, official CyanogenMod nightlies are now available for the device (codenamed aoba). The first CM9 build hit get.cm just a bit ago, so you're only a download away from having one of the smoothest, best supported AOSP ROMs on the planet. </p>
<p> Definition: A "nightly" is a bleeding edge release that is built on a daily basis, usually at night after a full day's worth of new code has been committed. </p>
<p> Back at CES in January we got a first glance at Sony's latest flagship phone, the Xperia Ion. In our time with it, the device made an impression with its 720P display and 12 megapixel camera. As expected, this device is finally showing up on AT&T with an announcement today of the device's availability later this month. </p>
<p> Sony, you really confuse me sometimes. The US is just about to get the Xperia Ion on AT&T, supposedly the Sony-branded flagship smartphone. The problem is that the Xperia GX just took that crown from the Ion - before it even came out. I'm not sure what Sony's grand master plan here is, but looking from the outside in, it seems like the company (that lost $5.7 billion last year - most of it in the fourth quarter alone) is flying completely and utterly blind. </p>
<p> An eager, eagle-eyed XDA member spotted a Google ad while searching for "xperia ion" that may be showing AT&T's hand concerning the release date of said device. One of a few ads that appear when searching for the device states that the Xperia Ion is "Coming Exclusively to AT&T in June." Well, that narrows it down a bit! </p>
<p> The ad doesn't give a specific date, but it does narrow down the date range significantly. </p>
<p> We stopped by the Sony booth earlier this morning at CES, and got some hands-on time with the very first Sony smartphones (Sony-Ericsson is no more, subject to regulatory approval) - the Xperia Ion and the Xperia S. While these devices were designed before the Sony Ericsson breakup, they'll be marketed as Sony devices when they hit retail channels. </p>
<p> AT&T embraced the go big or go home motto like a boss today at CES -- it announced six new Android devices. Three premium phones, two budget phones, and a budget tablet. Not only that, but every single one of these new devices will run on its 4G LTE network. Let's take a look at what we know so far, and we'll update as more info shows up. </p>
<p> Update: I would like to note that just because all of the phones are shown running Gingerbread, that doesn't mean they won't ship with ICS. </p>

<p> I suppose you have to give Sony credit for at least keeping its customers informed. Today, the manufacturer announced an update to its plans for bringing its phones up to Jelly Bean.

<p> Following those flagships, the Xperia P, Xperia J and Xperia go will start to receive their upgrades starting around the end of March. </p>
<p> Sony's just dropped a batch of bombshells on us today during an IFA press conference. Among the headlining new devices, the Xperia J which is being billed as an affordable smartphone with a "standout screen size." That "standout" size is 4", by the way. We're not entirely sure who Sony thinks they're going to impress with four inches, but the rest of the specs actually seem like a pretty good deal if the price is right. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/xperia-m2-2/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17483540" filename="xperia-m2-2">
<p> Sony has announced the Xperia M2 Aqua, a variant of the M2 that it's marketing as "the waterproof smartphone for everyone." It's Sony's first water-resistant phone with mid-range specs, and it's apparently ready to swim with the best of them. </p>
<p> In the small print, we see that the Xperia M2 Aqua is IP65 and IP68 compliant, meaning that it can withstand dust and survive being kept under 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. </p>
<p> We've been seeing quite a lot of Sony's "Xperia Sirius," and it looks like Sony is ready to take the wraps off of it here at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. As expected, it's the flagship successor to the Z1, somewhat disappointingly named the Xperia Z2. Sony is also announcing the Xperia M2 today, a more midrange phone with Sony's standard industrial design and dual SIM card slots. </p>
<p> The Z2 improves on the Z1 with a 5.2-inch 1080p LCD display, matching LG's G2. </p>

<p> xperia m5 </p>
<p> The Xperia Z series has marked the high-end of Sony's smartphone line for years. The M5 sits somewhere lower on the food chain, but not much lower. You're looking at a 5-inch 1080p display, 3GB of RAM, a 21.5MP camera, plus both water and dust resistance. </p>
<p> Now you also get Android 6.0. Sony has begun pushing out an over-the-air update to this device. </p>
<p> Sony has been rolling out Android 5.1 updates intermittently ever since last July... up to and past the point where Android 6.0's AOSP code has been available to manufacturers. The last few devices that received bumps to 5.1 were the Xperia C4 and C5 Ultra earlier this month, and today the Xperia M5 gets the same treatment. Users can wait for the over-the-air update alert in the usual manner, or use Sony's PC Companion computer program to download and install the update manually. </p>
<p> This "super mid-range" M5 was launched back in August, running Android 5.0 at launch, much to the consternation of Android fans who would have preferred the latest software. </p>
<p> After leaking last week, Sony has made the Xperia M5 official. This device is the spiritual successor to the Xperia M4 Aqua, but it has a more impressive camera. The 21.5MP sensor is joined by Sony's customary waterproof design and a 5-inch 1080p display. </p>
<p> Sony's smartphone division isn't doing great right now, but the company is still pumping out devices like there's no tomorrow (and maybe there isn't). The mid-range Xperia M5 and C5 Ultra have been leaked in full by Hi-Tech.Mail.ru, and one of them has some interesting design ideas. </p>

<p> If tiny smartphones that pack a punch are your thing, then today is your lucky day. Sony Ericsson just officially announced the new Xperia Mini and Xperia Mini Pro, which are both essentially the same phone, except the latter has a full slide out QWERTY. The new line succeeds last year's X10 Mini and X10 Mini Pro, but drops the X10 moniker and heavily beefs up the specs. Here are the details: </p>
<p> 3 Inch 320x480 display </p>
<p> 1GHz Snapdragon processor </p>
<p> 320MB internal storage (ouch), SD Card slot with 2GB card included </p>
<p> 5MP rear camera with 720p video capture and face detection </p>
<p> Sony BRAVIA engine </p>
<p> Android 2.3 </p>
<p> While the pair may not be the hottest thing to hit the streets lately, they definitely have the whole smallest-HD-smartphone thing going for them. </p>

<p> xperia neo v </p>
<p> There must be something weird going on with manufacturers lately - first Huawei released an alpha build of ICS for the Honor, and now Sony Ericsson (soon to be just Sony) has released an ICS ROM for certain unlocked Xperia devices, including the Arc S, Neo V, and Ray. </p>
<p> Since it's an alpha ROM, it's not made for day-to-day use, as it is limited to just a few functions at the moment. </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson has taken a lot of flak in the past for its slow roll-out of Android upgrades, however this no longer appears to be the case as today they have announced that alongside the launch of their newest Android device, the Xperia neo V, all 2011 Xperia smartphones (i.e. the Xperia arc, Xperia PLAY, and Xperia neo) will be upgraded to Android 2.3.4. </p>
<p> The update will bring a number of new features to the Xperia phones including video chat support for Google Talk, easier Facebook integration with "Facebook inside Xperia", swipe text input, screen capture support, and the ability to connect USB peripherals through the Sony Ericsson LiveDock. </p>

<p> Sony announced today on it's official Sony Mobile Developer blog that the Xperia S "experimental AOSP support" project, first announced by JBQ back in August, is no more. It was an interesting idea, to be sure - a non-Nexus device that would be supported both with the help of members of the Google developer community, as well as AOSP maintainer JBQ, on the AOSP main branch. </p>
<p> The project did see some success, too - Android was booting, and according to Sony, Wi-Fi and sensors were up and running. </p>
<p> In a gesture of good faith, Sony, on its developer blog, has announced the company is releasing the software binaries for the Xperia S. It has done so explicitly in support of Android developer JBQ's "experimental" support for the device in AOSP (found here). If you're unfamiliar with the project, we covered it earlier this month when it was announced. </p>
<p> The software binaries Sony released consist mainly of drivers for the hardware on the Xperia S's chipset. </p>

<p> I suppose you have to give Sony credit for at least keeping its customers informed. Today, the manufacturer announced an update to its plans for bringing its phones up to Jelly Bean. If you're rocking the Xperia T, Xperia TX, or Xperia V, you should see Android 4.1 "during February and March." Of course, this will depend on what market you're in or which variant you own. </p>

<p> Smartphones are great; they organize our lives, provide us with news and information, and keep us in touch with friends no matter how far away they may be. Smartphone gloves on the other hand? Not so much. They don't do a great job of keeping your hands warm in the cold weather, and they aren't exactly renowned for their comfort. </p>
<p> Fortunately for Xperia sola users, Sony has you covered. The Ice Cream Sandwich update for the sola, which began today, includes a new feature called "glove mode" which, you guessed it, allows you to wear any pair of gloves and still use your smartphone. </p>
<p> The rollout for all three devices is beginning today and continuing over the next few weeks in global markets, so keep an eye on your notifications if you're eager to update your software. </p>
<p> As well as updating users' devices to Ice Cream Sandwich, this latest update also comes with new Sony media applications, including a new Walkman app. </p>
<p> How often do you hear this? Sony has started to roll out Ice Cream Sandwich to the Xperia P ahead of schedule, beating its own date of August 19th. </p>
<p> According to a post on the Sony Mobile blog, the upgrade process is beginning today and continuing globally "over the next few weeks", so if you're an Xperia P owner, keep an eye out for any upgrade notifications on your phone. When ICS is ready for your device, you will be alerted, but Sony says that some users may have to use their PC Companion software to perform the update. </p>
<p> When touchscreen phones first became mainstream, countless people talked about how "impractical" a touch-only device was. Since then, touch devices have become the norm in the smartphone realm, with basically every modern high-end phone packing at least some sort of touch input. </p>
<p> Sony is taking the touch revolution to a whole new level with the Xperia sola, though, by bringing a new feature to the table called "floating touch" that allows the user to simply hover their finger over items in the browser and highlight them, much like using a mouse. </p>

<p> xperia tl </p>
<p> Ice Cream Sandwich may have been good enough for James Bond, but the Android die-hards who nabbed Sony's Xperia TL on AT&T want more. And by "more," we mean "an update to a newer version of Android." Fortunately, that's finally available. </p>
<p> Update: Looks like AT&T just started pushing the update over-the-air if you don't want to deal with flashing it manually. Head into Settings > About Phone > Software update to grab it. </p>
<p> If you head on over to Amazon Wireless this morning, you'll find the Xperia TL has had its price dropped to a mere penny on contract (new subscribers or upgrades). </p>
<p> The Xperia TL is Sony's current flagship smartphone, and packs a 4.6" 720p display, 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 processor, LTE, and a 13MP Exmor rear camera. At the low, low, price of "basically free," this is a pretty decent deal - $100 less than what you'd pay at an AT&T store. </p>
<p> It's a big day for AT&T devices! For starters, the headlining LG phone that's managed to grab our attention as the best not-a-Nexus device the company has put out in recent memory. The LG Optimus G goes on sale today on the nation's #2 carrier for $199 with a two-year contract. Of course, for $100 more you can pick up a Nexus 4 from the Play Store, though you'll lack LTE. </p>
<p> At the beginning of October, AT&T announced the Xperia TL would be available "in the coming weeks." If you've been waiting with bated breath to get your hands on the James Bond phone, November 2 looks like the day to mark on the calendar. </p>
<p> Android 4.0.4 (will be upgraded to 4.1 "following launch") </p>
<p> The Xperia TL will be available for a mere $99 with a two-year agreement, and runs on AT&T's up and coming LTE network. </p>
<p> AT&T just announced the James Bond phone, otherwise known as the Sony Xperia TL, will be the newest edition to its 4G LTE lineup. First announced back at IFA, the Xperia TL is Sony's newest offering to the high-end world: </p>
<p> 4.6" 1280x720 "Reality Display" </p>
<p> 1.5GHz dual-core processor </p>
<p> 13MP fast capture camera </p>
<p> NFC </p>
<p> Android 4.0.4 (will be upgraded to 4.1 "following launch") </p>
<p> The press release is pretty scant on release details, stating only that it will be available "in the coming weeks." </p>

<p> xperia tx </p>
<p> CyanogenMod 13 is the latest version of the popular open source custom ROM. It delivers Android Marshmallow to hundreds of devices, many with no hope of ever receiving an official update. On other hardware, CyanogenMod offers a chance to remove heavy skins and enjoy a mostly stock Android experience. The latest wave of devices receiving version 13 represents both types. </p>
<p> Team Win Recovery Project is the de facto standard for Android custom recoveries. While the open-source project often makes its way to disparate Android phones and tablets by the efforts of interested indie ROM developers, the maintainers of the project work tirelessly to bring official builds out as well. Today no less than seven new devices get the official treatment, and most of them are more niche, low-volume hardware that might not get major attention otherwise. </p>
<p> Owners of the Xperia T, TX, and V had a little hope before today that their beloved devices would see some of that KitKat goodness, but now their hopes lay dashed to bits at the feet of Sony's heartless engineers. These devices won't be making the jump to Android 4.4 KitKat, but will continue to live on with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. </p>
<p> Let's forget about KitKat for a moment. A large number of Android devices out there still need an update to the latest version of Jelly Bean, and while many of them will never receive such an OTA, four of Sony's handsets are receiving one this week. The company is rolling out an update to the Xperia T, TX, SP, and V. </p>
<p> In addition to Android 4.3, the OTA brings updated Sony pre-installed apps, more integration between the company's media apps, and the launch of the new "Xperia Themes" custom interface. These are joined with the security enhancements that typically come with newer versions of software. </p>
<p> Back in early February when Sony started pushing Jelly Bean to the Xperia T and V, it promised the same update for the TX by "the end of March." Here we are, with four days left in the month, and Sony has made good on that promise. You hear that, all other manufacturers? </p>
<p> At this time it's not completely clear what enhancements this brings outside of stock Jelly Bean's improvements, but it's likely similar to that of the Xperia T, V, and TL. Here's a look at that changelog: </p>
<p> Updated, more intuitive versions of Sony Media apps: WALKMAN, Album and Movies Lets you view and access all your photos, videos and tunes in one place. </p>
<p> I suppose you have to give Sony credit for at least keeping its customers informed. Today, the manufacturer announced an update to its plans for bringing its phones up to Jelly Bean. If you're rocking the Xperia T, Xperia TX, or Xperia V, you should see Android 4.1 "during February and March." Of course, this will depend on what market you're in or which variant you own. </p>
<p> Following those flagships, the Xperia P, Xperia J and Xperia go will start to receive their upgrades starting around the end of March. Following that release, the Xperia S, Xperia SL, Xperia ion and the Xperia acro S will be updated "in the subsequent weeks." </p>

<p> The rollout for all three devices is beginning today and continuing over the next few weeks in global markets, so keep an eye on your notifications if you're eager to update your software. </p>
<p> As well as updating users' devices to Ice Cream Sandwich, this latest update also comes with new Sony media applications, including a new Walkman app. </p>
<p> How often do you hear this? Sony has started to roll out Ice Cream Sandwich to the Xperia P ahead of schedule, beating its own date of August 19th. </p>
<p> According to a post on the Sony Mobile blog, the upgrade process is beginning today and continuing globally "over the next few weeks", so if you're an Xperia P owner, keep an eye out for any upgrade notifications on your phone. When ICS is ready for your device, you will be alerted, but Sony says that some users may have to use their PC Companion software to perform the update. </p>
<p> Sony's portfolio of non-Ericsson branded phones has just received two more additions, though they aren't much more than variations than the already-announced Xperia S. </p>
<p> The Xperia P features: a 4-inch "WhiteMagic" display, optimized for viewability in direct sunlight (for comparison, the Xperia S has a 4.3" display). It also features a 1 GHz dual core processor, 8 megapixel camera, NFC, and HDMI connectivity. The Xperia P will also launch alongside the SmartDock, which allows content on the phone's screen to be streamed to a TV. </p>

<p> Xperia X10 (es209ra) </p>
<p> Update: It looks like someone in Sony's camp got a little overzealous concerning this update, as it's actually not available just yet. According to the Sony Ericsson Product Blog, the launch is coming, but "[they] just need more days before [they] can push the button." We'll keep you posted of any developments on this front -- like, you know, when it's actually available. </p>
<p> Owners of the Sony Erricsson Xperia X10, make ready your computers - the official Gingerbread update is ready and available to download. </p>
<p> We first told you back in March that Sony would be bringing Gingerbread to non-carrier-branded Xperia X10 units, with a late Q2/early Q3 arrival. With the end of Q2 quickly approaching, Sony posted a new entry on its Product Blog this morning stating that "the current plan is [to] start the roll-out [at] the beginning of August," which hits the early Q3 target date right on the head. </p>
<p> This update will include the same camera app that is found in the Éclair version (this has apparently been a pretty big issue amongst X10 owners), as well as a lot of features found on the newer Xperia phones - like Facebook inside Xperia, the updated UI with pinch-to-overview, and an integrated EQ in the music player. </p>
<p> In this line of work, I get the chance to write about things that are new and exciting. Other times, however, that's just not the case. There are times when writing about certain subjects just makes me sad... and this is one of those times. Sure, it may be good news in a sense, but the fact that I am sitting here, on May 31, 2011, reporting an update to Android 2.1... </p>
<p> Owners of the Sony Xperia X10 around the world are rejoicing, because after a long wait, the previously locked bootloader has finally been cracked. What does this mean, you ask? In a nutshell, it means that the X10 can now handle custom features that other Android devices have had for some time, like kernels that allow for overclocking/undervolting, native USB/Wi-Fi tethering, removal of the 32fps cap, and a myriad of other tweaks. </p>
<p> Sony Ericsson has confirmed that it will not be updating its Xperia X10 line of smartphones to Android 2.2 Froyo. So, owners of the Xperia X10, X10 Mini and X10 Mini Pro will be stuck on Android 2.1 Éclair for the foreseeable future. However, Sony Ericsson has promised to provide some minor software updates, with features such as multitouch, later this year. </p>
<p> If you were looking for another reason to buy Google's Nexus S, here it is. </p>
<p> Amazon Wireless, Amazon's mobile arm, launched a big sale on all AT&T Android phones today in a weekend promotion that could easily rival even the upcoming Black Friday deals (BF is happening on Nov 25th). All of the AT&T Android phones Amazon Wireless carries are temporarily exactly 1 penny: </p>
<p> Motorola Flipout </p>
<p> Motorola Flipside </p>
<p> In addition to the above, a few other Android and some Win Phone 7 (if you're into that sort of thing) phones are also bearing the sweet sticker price of a mere cent: </p>
<p> Motorola Droid 2 </p>
<p> Motorola Citrus </p>
<p> HTC Surround (Win Phone 7) </p>
<p> Right on time, Sony Ericsson's begun rolling out the update to Android 2.1 Eclair (build number 2.0.A.0.504) for the Xperia X10, X10 Mini, and X10 Mini Pro. Judging by what we're seeing on Twitter and from what our tipster told us, it's only available in Scandinavia for now, so we can only hope that other regions will get to join in on the fun soon enough. </p>
<p> Our tipster also mentioned that Universal Androot does not work, although a bit of digging through the forums revealed that SuperOneClick does indeed root the phones, even after the update. </p>
<p> This morning Sony Ericsson posted a teaser video on YouTube explaining to X10 users the differences they will find in the update from Android 1.6 to 2.1. As painful as it is to watch a video of someone demonstrating five homescreens, slide-to-unlock and live wallpapers like they're brand new features, the video underscores the growing expectation that an update will be released for the X10 within the next few days. </p>
<p> (Note – It does have some wording on getting the update now – that is not yet really valid and it wasn’t scheduled to be released until the update is out there. </p>
<p> Who thinks strictly black and gray phones are gloomy and boring? I do and, thankfully, so does Best Buy. A few months ago, the retailer announced an exclusive white EVO 4G, and today we got word of not 1 but 2 more white Android phones arriving on October 24: Verizon's Samsung Fascinate and AT&T's slightly outdated Sony Ericsson Xperia X10. While the exact pricing on either of these is unknown, you can head over to Best Buy today and reserve the device of your dreams with a $50 deposit. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/xperia-xa1/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17483507" filename="xperia-xa1">
<p> xperia xa1 </p>
<p> The Xperia XA1 debuted back in February of 2017 as one of Sony's latest "super mid-range" phones. It's since been succeeded by the XA2, but that means that the XA1 can now be found for not a lot of money. Amazon currently has the XA1 for $180 with free one-day shipping, and Focus Camera has it for $189.99 with no tax depending on where you live. </p>
<p> Sony is usually quick to update their phones to the latest version of Android, but like many other manufacturers, it usually leaves the budget devices for last. The Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra were launched a year ago, both with MediaTek Helio P20 chips and impressive 23MP back cameras. Now the XA1, XA1 Plus, and XA1 Ultra are being updated to Android 8.0 Oreo. </p>
<p> It's Sony-day at MWC today with the introduction of the new flagship XZ2 and XZ2 Compact, but if you love the company's phones and can't wait for these devices to be available and you're on a limited budget, now is a good time to take a hard look at the Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra. Both phones are being discounted through several retailers and are now, if you ask me, much more realistically priced. </p>
<p> These days, many manufacturers include some sort of blue light filter or "night light" in their phones' ROMs. Google, Samsung, OnePlus, and some other companies are on the list, and Sony was as well with its "Good night actions" function in Xperia Actions for phones in the XA1 family. However, following the impending Oreo updates, no Sony phone will have a built-in blue light filter. </p>
<p> Back in February, Sony announced two new budget phones - the XA1 and XA1 Ultra. Comparable to the Moto G and G Plus respectively, Sony calls these devices "super mid-range." Now the XA1 has showed up for pre-order on Amazon and Best Buy for $299, in Black, Gold, Pink, and White. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/xperia-x-performance/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17483502" filename="xperia-x-performance">
<p> Every month or so, an update to ARCore rolls out to add the augmented reality framework to a whole new set of phones, tablets... and now Chromebooks? Yes, the first Chrome OS device has been found among the list of profiles included in the ARCore APK, and that is the recently released Acer Chromebook Tab 10. Also joining the list are the codenames associated with the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, blueline and crosshatch, which are due out this Fall. </p>
<p> Sony's new Xperia X line of phones was considered a bit overpriced when it launched. However, as all phones tend to do after time, they've since dropped in price. Today, you can grab an Xperia X Performance for only $299.99 - a full $200 off the sticker price. If you've been looking to grab a cheap Sony with mid- to high-end specs, now may be the time. </p>
<p> It's been a few months since Android 7.0 hit the AOSP code repository, and this is about the time of year that owners of non-Nexus (non-Pixel, now) flagships start to ask why their upgrades are taking so long. Well if your flagship just happens to be the latest high-powered Sony smartphone, you're in luck. The Xperia X Performance is receiving its Nougat update starting today, according to XperiaBlog. For the record, that's just a little over three months of waiting for the upgrade - not bad by current Android standards. </p>
<p> TWRP is by far the most popular custom recovery, and for good reason. Backing up your device, flashing ROMs, managing files in a pinch, and more are all possible through a customizable GUI. Now TWRP is expanding its reach to three more devices - the Sony Xperia XZ, Sony Xperia X Performance, and Samsung Galaxy J3 2016 Qualcomm (SM-J320YZ). </p>
<p> Considering the XZ was only released a week ago, this is pretty fast work from the TWRP maintainers. The other devices are a bit older, with the Xperia X Performance released in June of this year and the Galaxy J3 in January. </p>
<p> The Xperia X line is decent, but considerably behind competitors from Samsung and LG this year, with prices that border on the astronomical for their features. So what happens when you price your flagship phones too high and nobody buys them? Discounts, baby. Best Buy is already offering the mid-range Xperia X and flagship Xperia X Performance for considerably less than retail, and as unlocked GSM phones, too - no carrier shenanigans to be seen. </p>
<p> The beta, which Sony is calling the Xperia Beta Program, is currently only available to Xperia X Performance users in European countries (specifically Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands). Sony has not commented on whether it plans to expand the beta's reach. </p>
<p> When Ryan looked at the Xperia X Performance last month, his verdict was that it had a nice display, decent specs, but deal breakers like the lack of a fingerprint scanner and the poor camera left a sour taste in his mouth. That was nothing though compared to the shock of the price of the phone. $700. There are many, many better phones selling for that much and even less, so Sony's value proposition just seems ridiculous. </p>
<p> At a discounted price though, you could make a case for the X Performance. It does have a nice display after all, a solid build, a Snapdragon 820, IP68 water resistance (a bit of a rare feat still), 3GB of RAM, and if the camera's software is tweaked, it could yield good photos. </p>
<p> Sony is now accepting pre-orders for its line of Xperia X phones in the US, including the X and X Performance. We've already covered the Xperia X in detail, learning that it's a disappointing phone. But what of the top-of-the-line Xperia X Performance? It solves a few of the issues with the Xperia X, but it comes with a much higher $700 price tag. Is this the Sony phone you should buy, or should you buy none of them? Let's use the Xperia X as a thoroughly mediocre and overpriced yardstick to find out. </p>
<p> Sony has long been (rightly) criticized for ignoring the US market, opting to release phones here very late or not at all. In the case of the Marshmallow-powered Xperia X series, it's just a little late. These devices were announced at Mobile World Congress a few months ago with only vague talk about a US release, but now all four models are coming to the US in waves. It starts today with pre-orders for the Xperia X. </p>
<p> Pour one out for the Xperia Z series. It's served Sony well since 2013, going through a relatively rapid five generations in under three years, plus offshoots like the massive Xperia Z Ultra, the diminutive Xperia Z Compact and its well-regarded descendants, and even a tablet or two. But all things must pass away, and so it is with the Z moniker. Probably. There won't be an Xperia Z6 at any rate, at least according to the statement that the company gave to XperiaBlog. </p>

<p> Sony's phones don't have a working fingerprint sensor in the US, have confusing names, and are almost always expensive. But software updates is where Sony really shines, and now the company is updating two more phones to Oreo. </p>
<p> I think my favorite part of the holiday season is all of the sales that you can find on various items. Among those, phones are commonplace. It's a great time to pick up yesteryear's goodies at very low prices. This Deal Alert is just that: B&H has the black Sony Xperia XZ (F8331) for $304.99, saving you $70. </p>
<p> The Sony Xperia XZ debuted in the US with a rather astronomical MSRP of $700, but ten months later, the price has calmed down to more reasonable levels. This latest figure of $399.99 with a free 64GB microSD card is one of the best offers we've seen yet, and it's available for all three colors. </p>
<p> I've never actually seen anyone with an Xperia smartphone here in the United States, but presumably someone is buying them, because Sony still sells them here. The latest entry in Sony's line of devices, the Xperia XZ Premium, is now available to purchase in 'Murica for a penny shy of $800. </p>
<p> Did you like the Xperia XZ, but find it a crippling flaw that it couldn't shoot video in super slow-motion? Well, you're in luck, as the Xperia XZs is now available for purchase. It's capable of shooting a whopping 960fps with its new Exmor RS sensor. In the US, Amazon will sell you one of these bad boys for $699. </p>
<p> Sony has the tendency to significantly over-price its phones, with the Xperia XZ from last year being no exception. Since its launch a few months ago, it has steadily dropped in price. But now, you can grab one for $429.99, which a nice savings of $220. Oh, and you get free standard shipping and a U.S. warranty to boot. </p>
<p> The Sony Xperia XZ was announced at IFA last year, and later released in the United States in October. As you might expect from a phone initially costing $699, it's powered by a Snapdragon 820 CPU with 3GB of RAM. Now Xperia Blog has posted the first image of the upcoming XZ Premium, and it's very shiny. </p>
<p> One tradition with Sony smartphones is that they are nearly always overpriced at launch. Sony's latest flagship, the 2016 Xperia XZ, was no exception - it started at a whopping $699. Although the official MSRP has been marked down to $649 since then, you can now get it from Amazon for just $449.99. </p>
<p> B&H is one of my favorite stores. It is always dependable, most of the time has very good prices, and customer service is great as well. They are running a DealZone sale on a couple of Xperia phones and a JBL Pulse 2 Bluetooth speaker, among other things. Hurry up, it's a flash sale that will expire soon. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ hasn't been out for long in the United States, but its prices just keep dropping. Just a few days ago, this very phone went from its MSRP of $649.99 to as low as $581.98, but now, it's gone down another $80 or so to $499.99. That's a pretty damn good price for such a new device, even if you have to flash different firmware to get the fingerprint sensor to work. </p>

<p> Xperia XZ1 </p>
<p> Are you ready for a surprise? Paranoid Android/AOSPA, of long-standing ROM fame, has just pushed out a status update on the project's plans, as well as the first ever Oreo releases for the ROM. Unfortunately for the vast majority of us, they're only available for a handful of Sony phones. </p>
<p> Sony's Xperia XZ1 really isn't a bad phone if you can get over its 1080p display. The starting price of $699.99 was a little ambitious, but we've seen a couple of price drops since then. This latest deal marks the lowest price that we've seen thus far for the XZ1: $495, over $200 off the MSRP. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ1 was originally announced at IFA 2017, and it arrived in the United States in September. The original price was a whopping $699.99, but as usual, the price started to fall shortly after launch. The XZ1 dropped to $599 back in November, and now you can get the 'Warm Silver' model for $543.44 from Amazon. </p>
<p> Android phone buyers have been begging Google for years to do something about the platform's typically slow updates. As of this month, Android 8.0 Oreo only has 0.3% market share among Android devices, Marshmallow (released in 2015) is still at 30%, and Lollipop (from 2014) sits at 27%. Google's latest attempt to solve this problem is 'Project Treble,' a major restructuring of Android that is part of 8.0 Oreo. </p>
<p> Most of you may be under the impression that Google's Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL will be the first phones out with Android 8.0 Oreo. But it's not those two, or even the LG V30, that can claim that honor; it's actually Sony's Xperia XZ1. And now, you can grab one of these Oreo-toting phones for just a hair over $605 on Amazon through Focus Camera, with no tax charged unless you're in New York or New Jersey. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ1 is Sony's latest flagship, released less than a month ago in the United States. It's probably not the prettiest phone released this year, and it's fairly expensive (like all Sony phones), but it's not a bad device by any means. If you were looking to buy one, you'll be happy to know that it's already $50 off on Amazon (making the total $650). </p>
<p> We're in the thick of the holiday phone season, what with Apple's 2017 lineup on the table, Samsung's Note 8 available, and the Pixel announcement next week. Not to be deterred by all of that, Sony has opened up pre-orders for its next phone, the Xperia XZ1 Compact. </p>
<p> The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL may have leaked today, but we've still got around two weeks until they officially launch. So if you need a 2017 phone running Android 8.0 Oreo, you currently have one option: the Sony Xperia XZ1. That's right - the first phone to ship with Oreo isn't a Pixel, or even a Samsung or LG; it's a Sony. </p>
<p> In the past few months, Netflix has added HDR streaming support on a few devices including the Xperia XZ Premium and LG V30, and now two new phones announced in the past weeks have joined the fold: the Samsung Galaxy Note8 and the Sony Xperia XZ1. </p>
<p> The Note8 is the first Samsung device to be officially Netflix HDR compatible. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, despite having the required HDR displays, still haven't been officially green-lighted by Netflix to the dismay of many a user. The same can be said of Samsung's Galaxy Tab S3. It's good that those who put down almost $1k for the Note8 won't have to wait or wonder whether their shiny new phone will have it, but it'd be even better if those previous devices would get the official support soon. </p>

<p> xperia xz1 compact </p>
<p> Are you ready for a surprise? Paranoid Android/AOSPA, of long-standing ROM fame, has just pushed out a status update on the project's plans, as well as the first ever Oreo releases for the ROM. Unfortunately for the vast majority of us, they're only available for a handful of Sony phones. </p>
<p> Phones are getting massive, and even the smaller versions of Android flagships these days aren't all that small. The Pixel 2 has a 5.0" display, the Galaxy S8 a 5.8" unit (the 18:9 ratio skews that a bit), the P20 a 5.8-incher, and so on. Sony is the only holdout in the game with its 4.6" Xperia XZ1 Compact. If you long for a phone that you can easily use one-handed, this phone might be your match. It's currently down to an all-time low of $399.99 on Best Buy and Amazon, as well as $379.99 on B&H if you like pink. </p>
<p> Android phone buyers have been begging Google for years to do something about the platform's typically slow updates. As of this month, Android 8.0 Oreo only has 0.3% market share among Android devices, Marshmallow (released in 2015) is still at 30%, and Lollipop (from 2014) sits at 27%. Google's latest attempt to solve this problem is 'Project Treble,' a major restructuring of Android that is part of 8.0 Oreo. </p>
<p> Remember when we all thought the Galaxy Nexus's 4.65" display was enormous? Those days are long gone, but thankfully, Sony will still sell you a flagship with a screen about that large. The Xperia XZ1 Compact, originally priced at $599.99, has dropped to just $449 on eBay with a coupon code. Alternatively, you can grab one from Best Buy for $499.99 and get a free $50 gift card included. </p>
<p> Today, virtually the smallest mainstream Android flagship on the market is the 5.0" Pixel 2. That's a nice phone, but it's pricey and might still be too big for your liking. It's a good thing that the Xperia XZ1 Compact exists, then, and it's even better that it's currently discounted on Amazon to just $504.99. That's nearly $100 off on a still-new phone. </p>

<p> Sony is having a hard time in the smartphone business amidst declining sales and shrinking market share, but its users are likely more distressed right now. Many existing Sony users found that the recent Android 10 update broke their 2018 flagships almost universally, with no official communication from the company. In what appears to be a widespread issue, the affected Xperia XZ3 and XZ2 owners rallied on community platforms like Reddit complaining about a long list of bugs, including terrible RAM management, high battery consumption, app fails, and a generally sluggish UI. </p>
<p> Despite continuing losses in its mobile business sector, Sony still churns out phone after phone, much to the delight of its ardent fan base. It also maintains its existing lineup with new software updates and, just like many other manufacturers before it, the company has just shared when which of its devices will receive Android 10. </p>
<p> Today is another day for phone deals. Right now, you can pick up a Sony Xperia XZ2 from either Amazon or Best for $449.99, a savings of $50. That's a really decent price for a Snapdragon 845 device. </p>
<p> Unlike many OEMs, Sony is actually pretty good at launching its phones with the latest build of Android. The Xperia XZ1 was the first phone to ship with Android 8.0 Oreo, and the XZ3 was the first to ship with Android 9 Pie. The XZ2 wasn't as unique as its siblings in that regard, but it is among the first to receive the Android 9 Pie update. </p>
<p> ARCore's list of supported devices was just updated earlier this month, but with the introductions of so many new Android devices, a second revision for the month of August was required. Samsung's latest and greatest, the Galaxy Note9 and Galaxy Tab S4, are present, as are all three members of the Xperia XZ2 line and the Nokia 6.1 Plus. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ2 and XZ2 Compact were released earlier this year, and both are a significant design departure from Sony's previous devices. They have 18:9 displays, rear fingerprint sensors (that are actually enabled in the North America!), and glossy glass backs. Now you can get the XZ2 for $649.99 on B&H - a $150 discount from the MSRP, and about $50 lower than current prices at other retailers. </p>
<p> Every month or so, an update to ARCore rolls out to add the augmented reality framework to a whole new set of phones, tablets... and now Chromebooks? Yes, the first Chrome OS device has been found among the list of profiles included in the ARCore APK, and that is the recently released Acer Chromebook Tab 10. Also joining the list are the codenames associated with the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, blueline and crosshatch, which are due out this Fall. </p>
<p> It has been a big week for deals here at Android Police, and better still, a whole bunch of them are still going strong, as their savings continue to be available for shoppers looking to take advantage. Whether you're shopping for a new phone, some smart-home accessories, or just looking for a new source of entertainment, these deals have got you covered. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ2 and XZ2 Compact were announced less than two months ago, but they're already seeing some nice discounts. The larger XZ2 is down to $699.99, $100 off its MSRP, and the XZ2 Compact has dropped to $599.99 ($50 off). Amazon, B&H, and Best Buy are all offering these discounts. </p>

<p> One of the best parts of LineageOS (and its predecessor, CyanogenMod) is that it can breathe life into older devices. Some phones and tablets can end up with several more years of Android updates thanks to the ROM community. Since we last looked at LineageOS, a whopping 10 more devices have been added, most of which are a few years old at this point. </p>
<p> The lads and lasses on the open source CyanogenMod Team continue to bring their Android nightly ROMs to phones and tablets that have long been abandoned by uncaring manufacturers. This week a handful of new devices get builds for CM13, based on code from Android 6.0. All of them are nightlies (so possibly not ready for primetime), but I'll bet their respective users are happy to get the attention anyway. Here they are: </p>
<p> Pour one out for the Xperia Z series. It's served Sony well since 2013, going through a relatively rapid five generations in under three years, plus offshoots like the massive Xperia Z Ultra, the diminutive Xperia Z Compact and its well-regarded descendants, and even a tablet or two. But all things must pass away, and so it is with the Z moniker. Probably. There won't be an Xperia Z6 at any rate, at least according to the statement that the company gave to XperiaBlog. </p>
<p> #Android 5.1, Lollipop rolling out for original #Xperia Z Series & T2 Ultra - please check locally & watch for notifications </p>
<p> According to Sony's official PR team, the Android 5.1 OTA will start going out to the original Xperia Z series and the T2 Ultra. </p>
<p> Some of Sony's older hardware (well, relatively speaking, anyway) is getting updated to Lollipop today. If you own an Xperia Z (LTE model), Xperia ZR (LTE model), Xperia ZL, or Xperia Tablet Z, all released in 2013, check your status bar for an over-the-air update. According to Xperia Blog and the always-reliable XDA, all four of these devices are being upgraded as of now. As usual, it may take a few days or even a week or two for the rollout to reach you. </p>
<p> The various models range from prolific to somewhat niche, but it seems like the updates are going out to most or all countries simultaneously. </p>
<p> Sony's relationship with "pure" Android is an interesting one. As a company they generally make it easy to root or otherwise modify their phones or tablets, with a few notable qualifiers. The AOSP for Xperia project, which provides the basic tools for building standard Android ROMs on popular devices, is also one way that Sony stays relevant for those who buy phones with the intent to add aftermarket software. Today it gets two new flagship options, the older Xperia Z1 and Z2. </p>
<p> You can find the binaries for both new phones on the SonyXperiaDev GitHub. They're classified by codename: "Honami" is the Xperia Z1 while "Sirius" is the Z2. </p>
<p> Sony has announced that the latest version of KitKat is now rolling out to many of its Xperia products with Z in their name. That includes the Z, the ZL, the ZR, and the Tablet Z. For the confused, no, I'm not talking about smearing chocolate all over a Wii U controller. Sony just really likes the final letter of the alphabet, and it's now delivering Android 4.4.4 to four devices all bearing Z in their names. The software version is number 10.5.1.A.0.283. </p>
<p> just in: #android 4.4.4 rolls for #Xperia Z, ZL, ZR & Tablet Z – brings fixes, battery, wifi & email improvements and more #SonyXperia </p>
<p> When the company rolled out Android 4.4.2 to this same set of devices four months ago, more than a few users were left regretting the upgrade. </p>
<p> Update: Xperia Blog has confirmed this update is, in fact, Android 4.3. I can confirm that T-Mobile does, in fact, suck at changelogs. The version has also been tweaked to 10.4.C.0.814. </p>
<p> It might not be the latest and greatest anymore, but the Sony Xperia Z on T-Mobile is still getting some update love today. That mysterious Android 4.3 update that was pulled a few months back still isn't back, apparently. Instead, you get some small tweaks. </p>
<p> When you gather all these devices together for an update, there's no doubt Sony really loves the letter Z. Apparently it also loves KitKat, because all these devices are about to get their Android 4.4. KitKat updates. It's more than a number in this case – Sony has made some substantial tweaks. </p>
<p> Update: It looks like T-Mobile got cold feet. The support page has been reverted to its previous state, showing only the Android 4.2 update from November. Sorry, folks. </p>
<p> Do you use a Sony Xperia Z? Did you buy it from T-Mobile? Then check that Settings menu - according to this T-Mo support page, you're getting a taste of Jelly Bean 4.3 starting today. Of course these things tend to go out in waves, so those without patience can follow the links on T-Mobile's site and manually download and flash the new software (10.4.C.0.797) using the Sony PC Companion software. </p>
<p> The last time T-Mobile's carrier-customized version of the Z got an update was way back in November, when it was upgraded to Android 4.2. </p>

<p> One of the best parts of LineageOS (and its predecessor, CyanogenMod) is that it can breathe life into older devices. Some phones and tablets can end up with several more years of Android updates thanks to the ROM community. Since we last looked at LineageOS, a whopping 10 more devices have been added, most of which are a few years old at this point. </p>
<p> The OTA has started rolling out to some Xperia Z5 and Xperia Z5 Premium users and will probably expand to the Z5 Compact soon. </p>
<p> Normally only Nexus and other first-party Google devices get a taste of an upcoming Android version before it's released, barring custom ROMs and other end user activities. But Sony has been offering experimental AOSP builds for some of its phones for some time, and today the company has surprised and delighted owners of the former flagship Xperia Z3 with a custom Android N developer preview. This is more or less the same as the preview builds for Nexus phones and tablets, and it includes the Play Store and Google Services - everything one needs for a full Android experience. </p>
<p> After updating more recent flagship devices to Marshmallow in March, Sony commenced its Marshmallow rollout for other phones and tablets in its range earlier this month, including the Xperia Z2, the Z3, and the Z3 Compact. Now the Japanese consumer electronics company is updating more of the Xperia line to Marshmallow, including the Z2 Tablet, the Xperia Z3 Dual, and other Z2/Z3 variants from around the world. </p>
<p> According to Xperiablog, the only devices which got the update earlier in April were those in the Beta Marshmallow (also known as the Concept builds) program. Naturally, it makes sense those were updated first, and then other similar devices follow suit. </p>
<p> I'm not going to mince words here: if you don't have a Nexus phone, odds are pretty good that you aren't running Android 6.0. The best that you can say of most manufacturers when it comes to this software cycle is that maybe they're kinda-sorta trying to update last year's flagship phones. Sony has been a little better than most in that regard - they've already updated several phones and tablets from the Z4 and Z5 series, and now even older models are getting in on the action. According to XperiaBlog, the Xperia Z2, Xperia Z3, and Xperia Z3 Compact are being updated to Android 6.0 starting today. </p>
<p> Few would be surprised to hear that the Xperia Z5, Sony's latest flagship, would eventually get Android 6.0. The question is when that update will arrive. </p>
<p> Few Android OEMs take their updates as seriously and as extensively as Sony does, and Marshmallow is no exception. Ever since the source code for Android 6.0.0 was released by Google, the company revealed which devices in its portfolio will get it (hint: they go as far back as the Xperia Z2), released AOSP binaries for a slew of devices including its new Xperia Z5 and Z5 Compact, and announced concept Marshmallow builds for the Z3 and Z3 Compact that are open for 10,000 testers. Now these builds are starting to roll to users who signed up for them and you have more opportunities to try them out if you own a compatible smartphone. </p>
<p> Sony's non-presence in the US smartphone market only seems to be accelerating of late, with the company having closed all of its retail stores in the country (apart from the one on Madison Avenue in NYC), shut down its online shop (it redirects all listings to 3rd party retailers), and cancelled its only known upcoming device. This, alongside increasingly dismal sales performance for Xperia phones even outside America, tends to paint a not-nice picture of the company's smartphone division. </p>
<p> But Sony Pictures lives on, and with it, the blockbuster Daniel Craig Bond franchise. The upcoming 007 film Spectre will, of course, feature a lot of Sony product placement, including the generally well-liked Xperia Z5... </p>
<p> Sony is ahead of most other OEMs when it comes to its support of open source. It contributes significantly to AOSP and even releases binaries for many of its devices so developers can build AOSP ROMs for them. Today, Sony is announcing support for the first three 64-bit devices in the Open Device project. </p>
<p> Sony is ready to take its Android phones to the next Lollipop level. The company is sticking to its previous word that the Z series devices will start getting Android 5.1 in July and is starting the roll-out today with the Z3 and Z2 series. So consider yourself lucky if you have an Xperia Z3, Z3 Compact, Z3 Tablet Compact, Z2, or Z2 Tablet, because you're among the first Sony owners to get Android 5.1... well, if we don't count the GPE Z Ultra. </p>
<p> You'll obviously get all the benefits of Android 5.1, like better volume control and plenty of design and usability tweaks, but Sony has also added a few improvements to its own software. </p>

<p> Sony is ready to take its Android phones to the next Lollipop level. The company is sticking to its previous word that the Z series devices will start getting Android 5.1 in July and is starting the roll-out today with the Z3 and Z2 series. So consider yourself lucky if you have an Xperia Z3, Z3 Compact, Z3 Tablet Compact, Z2, or Z2 Tablet, because you're among the first Sony owners to get Android 5.1... </p>
<p> Xperia owners, watch out. Lollipops are raining from the sky and smashing straight into your screens. If you welcome this phenomenon, don't do anything. These lollipops have heat-seeking sensors and will find your devices wherever they lay. If you prefer KitKat, you can swat the intruders away, but you'll never get to experience the future changes in store for your Android device. </p>
<p> Sony has confirmed that it is launching lollipops at Xperia Z3, Z3 Compact, and Z3 Tablet Compact devices all over the world (some of these updates were previously pushed out to smaller, test markets). </p>
<p> Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact, Z2, and Z2 Tablet owners around the world may soon have a reason to smile. According to XperiaBlog, Sony has started to roll out Android 5.0 to these three devices in various regions. This news comes shortly after the Japanese manufacturer started pushing out Lollipop to the Xperia Z3 and Z3 Compact yesterday. </p>
<p> If you live in a real-life version of the latest James Bond or Spider-man flicks, where absolutely every piece of electronics everywhere is made by Sony, then we've got good news: the PS4 Remote Play app is now available for download. This lets the Xperia Z3, Z3 Compact, and Z3 Tablet Compact use a PlayStation 4 controller and super-fast streaming video to play PlayStation 4 games over a home Wi-Fi network. </p>
<p> Tucked into the flurry of news around Sony's trio of new Xperia Z3 devices was the fact that they'll be the first non-gaming gadgets to use the company's proprietary PlayStation 4 Remote Play system. The flagship Xperia Z3, high-powered "mini" Xperia Z3 Compact, and the 8-inch Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact will be able to stream PS4 games and play them across a home Wi-Fi network later this year. The PS4 can already stream gameplay to the PlayStation Vita. </p>
<p> Here at IFA 2014 in Berlin, Sony is announcing new entries to its Xperia smartphone line at all levels. The flagship Z series, last updated only six months ago at Mobile World Congress, has been bolstered with the Xperia Z3. This device is the tip top of Sony's line, though in terms of sheer hardware it's an evolution rather than a revolution. The 5.2-inch 1080p screen, Snapdragon 801 processor (bumped up to 2.5Ghz), and 20.7MP rear camera are similar to the last iteration, but the body is much thinner at 7.3mm. </p>

<p> x phone </p>
<p> The leakiest and one of the most mysterious phones in recent history just got a little less mysterious as @evleaks dropped the first official press renders onto our sleepy heads late Friday night. The OS is close to stock (it's Android 4.2.2 for now, but we fully expect 4.3 soon after its release), the cameras are where they're supposed to be, the on-screen buttons make us happy, and overall, it's not such a bad-looker for a mid-spec, affordable device. </p>
<p> Google+ user Дима Прокопенко has just given us a tantalizing, more complete look at the Moto X, posting a Rogers "Tech Experts" demo video that shows off some of the hotly-anticipated device's unique features. </p>
<p> Before we get to features, it's worth noting that the video indicates a Rogers launch "in August," as an exclusive for the Canadian carrier. </p>
<p> The video also shows off the Moto X's always-on voice commands, allowing users to query Google Search with their voice regardless of whether they're in the search app. </p>
<p> The conferences put on by AllThingsD tend to be a bit sedate - Walt Mossberg gets on stage with some Very Important People and picks their brain in front of a live audience. Not so with tonight's interview of Motorola CEO Dennis Woodside and Research & Development head Regina Dugan. At the D11 stage, Woodside let loose with a flurry of information about the company's plans for the remainder of the year, starting with the much-rumored X Phone. </p>
<p> Intrepid leakster @evleaks has just dropped a few images of a black-boxed Motorola device that appears to be headed for AT&T. It's worth noting that this is the first Motorola product we've seen badged up for an American carrier since the RAZR HD / RAZR M last summer, quite a long time ago. </p>
<p> It's also a phone we've seen before. At least, it seems to be. Vietnamese blog Tinhte leaked a device with the codename "XT912A" (XT is Moto's typical device prefix for "DROID" branded devices), and it's pretty clear the two are one in the same in most respects, at least based on what we see in these photos. </p>
<p> Let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we? The year was 2012, the Galaxy S III and the HTC One X were still new, and some jerk on the internet suggested that maybe it's cool if people started appreciating their amazing phones instead of complaining about how their device wasn't revolutionary. </p>
<p> In the time since then, certain segments of the tech community have opted to go in the other direction. </p>
<p> Ever since the WSJ dropped a hint about the mythical 'X Phone' back in December, the rumors have not stopped flowing. Which is great because, according to Motorola's CFO, the 18 months of product pipeline that Google acquired weren't exactly wow-ing anyone. However, according to Moto's design chief Jim Wicks, the next generation of hardware will be fantastic. </p>
<p> The handsets have been in the works for the last eight months (so since around August, for those counting), and will target the segments of the market that's looking for a "just right" screen size. </p>
<p> Hey, so, this is crazy, but Google bought a smartphone company (Motorola), and now they're working on a smartphone together. Shocker. Snarkiness aside, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that, according to its sources, Motorola and Google are working on making a flagship phone specifically to compete with the iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy line. It is internally known as the 'X Phone,' and will allegedly be released in 2013. </p>
<p> At this point, if Motorola and Google weren't working on a high-end phone for 2013, I'd be worried. </p>

<p> Xtorm </p>
<p> Yesterday I reviewed some of Xtorm's USB-C products and came away pleased but not convinced by the prices. It then occurred to me that a little discount could go a long way in making these prices palatable so I reached out to Xtorm and got y'all a 20% coupon code discount. If you were interested in grabbing something from the company, this makes the products more competitive against other brands. </p>
<p> Xtorm makes EU-compatible (EU plug, 220V) hubs, chargers, and cables. The most interesting to me was the Vigor power hub since it marries one USB-C port, one USB QC 3.0 port, 4 regular 2.4A USB ports, and a Qi wireless charging pad on top. </p>
<p> There are many perks to living in the US: Google services availability, frequent Amazon deals, lower tech prices (on average), and the fact that many tech companies are based there, meaning you never have to worry about plugs and voltages when buying your gadgets. Cross the Atlantic and the story gets a bit more complicated. Each time we, the poor souls living in Europe and countries that follow the European electricity standards, want to buy something new that isn't officially available for us, we have to make sure it works on 220-240V and that as a bonus, it has an EU plug so we don't have to use a small adapter that will add weight and could cause the whole thing to fall off the wall at any time. </p>

<p> Hot on the heels of ASUS pushing out Jelly Bean to the TF300, Motorola has announced that ICS is now available for the Wi-Fi Xyboard 10.1 and 8.2. </p>
<p> The update should be rolling out OTA-style now, and brings a host of new features: </p>
<p> Updated Browser with faster rendering, zoom and pan: Users can also now save pages for offline reading and request desktop versions of websites. </p>
<p> Swipe to dismiss notifications and recent apps: You can now dismiss individual notifications and apps from the Recent Apps list with a simple swipe of a finger. </p>
<p> The first Droid-branded tablet duo, the Droid Xyboard 10.1 and 8.2, are both in line to receive an update from Big Red. The OTA includes basically the same features for both: </p>
<p> Device Features </p>
<p> Enhanced browser performance to improve scrolling. </p>
<p> Improved touch response. </p>
<p> Maintain data connection when switching between Wi-Fi and the Verizon 3G and 4G LTE networks. </p>

<p> Pricing aside, Sony phones are generally well-liked. That means that an event such as Black Friday could be the perfect time to pick one up. Currently, we're seeing some decent sales on the last-gen Xperia XZ2 and Xperia XA2 Ultra, with a $50 discount on the Xperia XZ3 as well, from multiple retailers. </p>
<p> For developers wishing to tinker with Sony phones, the Open Devices program is a welcome official point of entry. The Japanese company adds most of its high-profile Android handsets to the list of supported devices after a little while, and the Xperia XZ2 and XZ3 are the latest to join the ranks. </p>
<p> Unlike many OEMs, Sony is actually pretty good at launching its phones with the latest build of Android. The Xperia XZ1 was the first phone to ship with Android 8.0 Oreo, and the XZ3 was the first to ship with Android 9 Pie. The XZ2 wasn't as unique as its siblings in that regard, but it is among the first to receive the Android 9 Pie update. </p>
<p> The Xperia XZ2 and XZ2 Compact are arguably Sony's best-looking phones yet. Unveiled at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona in February, the latest Sony flagships have rear fingerprint sensors and sport 18:9 displays with far less bezel than we're accustomed to from Xperia devices. They both include the freshest Snapdragon 845 chip with 4GB of RAM and will ship with Android 8.0 Oreo. </p>
<p> I was impressed by them in my hands-on at MWC, especially in view of Sony finally embracing a more modern design aesthetic — even if the Compact is a little chunky. </p>
<p> Today at MWC 2018 in Barcelona Sony announced its latest flagship Android phones, the Xperia XZ2 and XZ2 Compact. Looking at them without context, you'd be forgiven for thinking they were released a couple of years ago. Yet these are Sony's most modern smartphone designs ever, with curved 3D glass and much smaller bezels than previous Xperia devices. </p>

<p> yahoo news digest </p>
<p> Android tablet users know what it's like to get stuck with a phone app stretched out to a large display. It's less of an issue today than it used to be, now that smartphones come with 1080p displays and apps sport visual elements that would look crisp on a television screen. But sometimes you're still left with an excess of white space or an interface that you can't spin horizontally, even though that's how you want to hold your tablet. </p>
<p> Well, Yahoo has updated its News Digest app to play along more nicely with Android tablets. The interface still looks similar to the highly stylized experience users have grown accustomed to on their phones, but now it's wider, and you get to swipe left and right. </p>
<p> Yahoo has released another Android app and - hey, come back here, this is actually cool - it's an attractive take on providing the news. Yahoo News Digest gathers bits of news from around the Internet (various reports, video, Wikipedia entries, Google maps, etc.) and puts them together to form a single story. The formula isn't quite the same as Circa's, but it should seem familiar to anyone accustomed to that bite-sized news app. Presentation is half the appeal here, and you may be pleased to know that Yahoo has done a good job creating an app that doesn't offensively ignore all of Android's taste in design. </p>

<p> Note: This is an adaptation of my Nexus 4 update/root post, so it has some duplicate content, but all the instructions and images are specific to the Galaxy Nexus. </p>
<p> A few days ago, Google pushed out the Android 4.2.2 (build JDQ39) update to the takju variants of the Galaxy Nexus. Takju Nexuses are the devices sold in the Google Play Store, whereas yakju ones can be found in other retail channels. Good news for those waiting on the latter - though a day after its sibling, we finally have the yakju OTA file that can be applied manually on any stock device, including unrooted ones with stock recovery. </p>
<p> About a week after the Takju variant of Samsung's Galaxy Nexus got its 4.2 update, it looks like the same is rolling out to the Nexus' Yakju variant. The update (build JOP40C), for those not willing to wait, is also available for manual download and flashing (check the link below). </p>
<p> It should be noted that this update is meant solely for the Galaxy Nexus Yakju – that's the international version not from the Play Store – and your device should be running build JZO54K before you try to install the update. </p>
<p> If you've been waiting for Android 4.1.2 to hit your GSM Galaxy Nexus (yakju), wait no more. Google has already begun the OTA process, but in case you haven't gotten yours yet, we've got the direct link for manual installation. Yay for you! Here's how to make it happen. </p>
<p> First and foremost, you'll need to meet a couple of prerequisites: </p>
<p> You must be using a yakju device. Not takju, yakjuux, yakjuxw, or any other variant. </p>
<p> In the last 2 days, we've seen a whole lot of Android 4.0.4 goodies. First, Google unleashed the Android 4.0.4 AOSP code, then followed up by sending out incremental OTA updates to the Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, and XOOM Wi-Fi. Maintaining the momentum, today our favorite Android release engineer JBQ today put together full OS images for the GSM Nexus S and GSM Galaxy Nexus, which can be used to completely restore compatible devices back to stock. </p>

<p> Last year the XBMC project changed its name to Kodi, giving the media manager a much-needed fresh start considering how it has long since expanded past its original Xbox roots. Yatse is a popular remote app for use with the platform that recently got a spiffy material redesign. </p>
<p> Kodi (formerly the Xbox Media Center) isn't the only piece of software attempting to find a new image. One of the most popular Android remote control apps for the media manager, Yatse, is getting a major visual overhaul. Version 5.0, now available in a Google+ beta, is showing off a shiny new interface that takes more than a few pages out of the Material Design playbook. Check out some comparison shots below. </p>
<p> If Yatse is your go-to XBMC remote on Android, this weekend's update should be a nice surprise. If you're still looking for a good remote solution, now may be the time to check this one out. </p>
<p> In short, Yatse got bumped to version 4.0, which brings a handful of new features to the already-powerful application, like Chromecast support, Muzei integration, a newly designed interface, improved speed and stability, an internal audio player, and offline media support. </p>
<p> Let's be honest, most of us will never get to live in a crazy futuristic home like the Jetsons, but that doesn't mean we can't strive for a few of the simple luxuries. To that end, Doug Gregory is on track to make his living room smarter than the bridge of the USS Enterprise, all with a few electronic controllers and extensive use of Tasker. There's no way around it, you really need to see the video for this one. </p>

<p> yeah mail in rebates suck but whatever </p>
<p> If a smartwatch is in the deepest desires of your heart, but you just can't stand the idea of coughing up $350(ish) to get one of the higher end models, Newegg may finally be the company to get that death grip off your wallet with a new deal on the LG Watch Urbane (which is arguably the best Android Wear watch out there right now). </p>
<p> This works by utilizing a small collection of discounts, coupons, and mail-in rebates to get the price down from $350 to just $240. Here's the breakdown: </p>
<p> $30 instant rebate (read: you don't have to do anything) </p>
<p> $60 coupon code: EMCAWKW92 </p>
<p> $20 mail-in rebate </p>
<p> Yeah, that last bit is easily the crummiest part of this whole deal, because having to mail junk in and wait for however many weeks to get your prepaid Visa rebate card back basically sucks. </p>

<p> Yeelight </p>
<p> Cody reviewed a cool little gadget by Xiaomi last week – the Yeelight. It's an LED lamp that's controllable via a smart phone application using a Bluetooth LE connection. According to Cody, it works well and is a solid option for someone wanting a mood light, or a wake-assist lamp, without investing a ton on money into a full-blown smart lighting system. If you want to know more about it, then be sure to check out his full review. </p>
<p> Think it's cool? Well then you can buy one on Amazon. They sell for $69, but today you can buy one for $10 less with coupon code O5TOJGWW, which brings the price down to $59 (you probably could have done that math on your own). </p>
<p> Connected "smart" lighting is far from a new concept, but in late-2012, Philips released the first Hue lightbulb which became the blueprint for a new category in an old market. It was no longer enough for lights to turn on at a scheduled time or with a clunky wireless remote, they had to become smarter, more efficient, more flexible, and we wanted to control them with our smartphones. But a product of this type lends itself to variations, special features, and stylistic choices beyond those of the original innovation. This brings us to the Yeelight, a Bluetooth-enabled bedside lamp with a stylish look, simple controls, and a couple of clever features to go along with it. </p>

<p> Several news outlets are reporting receiving invitations from Google for an announcement set to take place at the 2019 GDC (Game Developer Conference) next month. Details included in the invitation itself are sparse, apparently stating only that "all will be revealed" at a keynote during the conference on March 19th at 10AM PT, 1PM ET. This effective announcement of an upcoming announcement has renewed speculation surrounding Google's potential entry into the game-streaming market. </p>
<p> Earlier this year, rumors began circulating about 'Yeti', a game streaming service from Google. Much like Nvidia GeForce NOW and other platforms, it would allow users to play modern games on low-end hardware (because the rendering is done by off-site servers). Kotaku has now confirmed this information, and provided additional details. </p>

<p> Yoga Book </p>
<p> Lenovo's Yoga Book was one of the more interesting hardware launches of last year. It had the form factor of a 2-in-1 laptop, but the bottom panel could switch between a touch keyboard and a drawing pad. At launch, both Windows and Android models were available. </p>
<p> Back in December, a Lenovo executive stated that a Chrome OS variant would be released in 2017. Unfortunately, a recent Chromium commit discovered by Chrome Unboxed seems to indicate that the model will not see the light of day. </p>
<p> I wanted to review one of Lenovo's unique tablet-with-a-kinda-sorta-keyboard-touchpad models as soon as I saw them. My Android Police colleagues thought the core idea behind the Yoga A12 was dumb, saddling the flexibility of a tablet with the extra size and weight of a laptop while taking away its greatest advantage, a full keyboard. So I asked Lenovo for a review unit. They told me no. That probably should have been a second hint that this wasn't going to be an especially impressive product. </p>
<p> Lenovo's Yoga Book was released last year, featuring a 'Halo' keyboard - combining an active digitizer and touch keyboard. The device has received plenty of media attention, and is available in a $499 Android version or $549 Windows version (with an upcoming Chrome OS option), both with a 10.1" display. </p>
<p> The Yoga Book is definitely one of the most interesting and divisive laptop designs to come out in a while - users either love or hate its touchscreen/keyboard deck hook. To a digital artist its integrated "Create Pad" is a godsend, but a mechanical keyboard fan probably sees its integrated haptic key layout as sacrilege. Either way, you'll soon have more options if you want to check out that unique hardware: a Lenovo executive told a Tom's guide reporter that the Yoga Book would be sold in a Chrome OS model in 2017. </p>
<p> The Lenovo Yoga Book is... odd. When it was announced in September, it was very different from any laptop or convertible I had seen before. Instead of the standard keyboard and touchpad combination, the bottom panel is a giant Wacom digitizer for sketching and taking notes. When you need to be productive, the bottom panel can switch to the 'Holo keyboard,' a touch keyboard and trackpad in the typical laptop layout. </p>
<p> Now that reviews are out, what is the general consensus? Everyone who has tried it remarks about how amazing the device looks in person. LaptopMag called it, "one of the most beautiful pieces of technology I've ever laid my eyes upon," in their review. </p>
<p> Lenovo turned a lot of heads when it announced its latest Yoga design, the Yoga Book. It's essentially a convertible laptop with a fold-back screen, complete with the Yoga line's well-regarded watch band hinge. But the Yoga Book has an ace up its sleeve: instead of a conventional keyboard, it uses a gigantic touch-sensitive panel that includes a dedicated keyboard mode, with virtual backlit "keys" that can be activated at a touch. Windows and Android versions are being made, and the latter is now up for pre-order. </p>
<p> Lenovo's Yoga Book is what the company is calling, "the first tablet for natural sketching and note-taking," and "the world's thinnest and lightest 2-in-1." What makes this tablet so special? Lenovo's "halo keyboard." Much to the chagrin of typists everywhere, this is a purely touch keyboard, which makes the "thinnest and lightest 2-in-1" claim true. But Lenovo claims over 18 months of development work has gone into testing and improving the halo keyboard, including features such as haptic feedback and accidental keypress detection. </p>

<p> yoga tablet 10 hd+ </p>
<p> Lenovo's initial Yoga tablets were novel thanks to their curved chassis with plus-sized batteries and integrated kickstands, but the lackluster specs (headlined by MediaTek processors) turned a lot of hardware fans off. The refreshed version of the 10-inch Yoga fixed that with a slightly better Snapdragon 400, 2GB of RAM, and a 1920x1200 screen. You can pick up a Yoga 10 Tablet HD+ for $100 off from Amazon, bringing the price down to a more reasonable $249.99. </p>
<p> My love of devices with built-in kickstands is well-documented. So it's no surprise that Lenovo's Yoga Tablet line, which is more or less built around the kickstand (or at least a big, rounded, multi-purpose hump that holds the kickstand and several other neat things) would catch my attention. The first versions were brought down by sub-par hardware, but Lenovo is back with the Yoga Tablet 10 HD+, which addresses a lot of the issues with the original. </p>
<p> Lenovo isn't really known for putting out the best Android tablets on the market, and last year's lackluster YOGA tablets are a perfect example of that. The design seemed nice, but both the eight and 10 inch versions of the device were simply lacking in the spec department. Lenovo is looking to change that stance this year with the all new YOGA Tablet 10 HD+, which takes what worked with the original's form factor and stuffs it full of mostly decent hardware. </p>

<p> The New York Times has recently released an application for Android, and it looks great! </p>
<p> Appearing on the Android Market following releases on both the iPhone and WebOS platforms, the NYT application looks extremely similar to its iPhone counterpart. You can access news from an abundance of sections via a drop down menu, similar to how you’d pull down the notification bar. </p>
<p> The interface is extremely simple, and easy to navigate. </p>
<p> Andy Rubin, VP of Engineering at Google, recently gave an interview to the New York Times, touching on topics ranging from Flash to North Korea. With Google vying for top place in the smartphone market, Rubin seemed confident that Android devices can overtake the number of iPhones, saying </p>
<p> I don’t know when it might be, but I’m confident it will happen. Open usually wins. </p>
<p> When commenting on the number of Android devices that are currently on the market, Rubin said that the driving force behind Android taking off is the fact that it’s open and available to so many manufacturers, commenting on how </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/yotaphone-2/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17483655" filename="yotaphone-2">
<p> yotaphone 2 </p>
<p> The dual-screen e-paper/LCD YotaPhone 2 has a sufficiently interesting gimmick that it was able to rack up almost $300,000 on Indiegogo last month. However, the Russian smartphone maker has reached out to backers to share some sad news. It is unable to get the North American variant manufactured in a timely manner, so it's cancelling the device entirely. </p>
<p> In what sounds like a perversion of the crowd-funding concept, Yota has taken to Indiegogo to bring a phone that has existed since early 2014 into existence... in North America. To perform this undertaking, the company wants a paltry $50,000, and it has set a flexible funding goal to get the funds. Fortunately that's irrelevant, because it has already shattered that bar in under three hours with the help of nearly 100 funders. </p>
<p> While the video makes a mention of this campaign's purpose, it's easy to browse the Indiegogo page and get the impression that the YotaPhone 2 isn't yet a thing. </p>
<p> The YotaPhone 2 and its predecessor have always intrigued me. They're probably the only significant departure in form factor available on the market right now that isn't different for the sake of being so, adds value, and has been relatively successful in its endeavor. After its European release last December, the YotaPhone 2 is coming back with a new color variant: white. And it looks striking if you ask me, especially with that new E Ink white theme where the old interface's colors are inverted. </p>
<p> But let's back up. The white YotaPhone 2 keeps the same specs as the black one: a primary 5-inch Full HD AMOLED screen, a 4.7-inch 960x540 E Ink screen on the back, a Snapdragon 801 processor, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and an 8MP rear camera. </p>
<p> Since Yota itself hasn't been all that forthcoming with the phone's detailed specs, we're glad to see the reviewer list them out. </p>
<p> Update: It looks like a few English-speaking news outlets have been given early review units as well. Engadget has one, and so does Cnet, among a few less-reliable sites. Cnet was kind enough to post a video, embedded below. </p>
<p> Are you curious to see how the versatile YotaPhone 2 performs in the real world? So are we. But with a launch in Russia and Europe scheduled for later this week and no US launch in sight, we'll have to admire it from afar. One Russian technology site is a little more lucky, however: Hi-Tech.mail.ru has managed to snag a review unit. </p>
<p> Yota's unconventional hardware design has gained the company a lot of press, but following the Mobile World Congress debut of the YotaPhone 2, we've heard nary a peep for the better part of a year. That changed today in a Moscow presentation: the second-gen phone with a built-in e-ink screen on the rear of the case will go on sale in 20 European countries later in December, presumably including Russia. The price will be 33,000 Rubles, approximately $610 or 495 Euro, though taxes and fees may push it higher in some places. </p>
<p> After Europe, the YotaPhone 2 will expand to China and other Asian countries in early 2015, followed by Canada and Latin America. </p>
<p> When I saw the prototype YotaPhone last year at CES 2013, I was legitimately impressed with the concept - a smartphone with a standard, full-color display on the front, and a black and white e-ink panel on the back. The applications, functional and aesthetic alike, were not difficult to see. </p>
<p> But the original YotaPhone was quite hefty, both displays were a bit small at 4.3", and the e-Ink panel wasn't actually touch-enabled, but rather was controlled by a capacitive touch panel along the bottom of the device. And, honestly, it wasn't exactly what I'd call pretty - it looked like an engineering prototype, not a piece of consumer hardware. </p>
<p> I honestly think the YotaPhone was one of the coolest smartphone innovations of 2013, and while I wouldn't exactly be the first in line to buy a device from an unproven OEM, Yota Devices has once again piqued my curiosity with their announcement of the "next generation" YotaPhone here at MWC. </p>
<p> The new YotaPhone solves what was arguably the biggest problem with the original's otherwise innovative concept - interacting with the e-Ink display. On the old device, this was done via a series of gestures on a touchpad along the bottom of the e-Ink panel. On the new YotaPhone, the panel is fully touch-enabled, eliminating the need for that less than perfect workaround. </p>

<p> This year's CES sucks. But that doesn't mean there can't be a few genuinely cool things floating around out there in an otherwise dull ocean of 4K and touchscreens. Case in point: YotaPhone, which sadly isn't even on the CES show floor at all. We covered the announcement of the YotaPhone, but really, seeing and using it in person does the idea so much more justice. </p>
<p> On paper, it seems pretty straightforward: a phone with a screen on both sides. </p>

<p> Your Phone </p>
<p> Microsoft announced a handful of improvements for its Your Phone Android-to-Windows integration and app-streaming back at Samsung's unpacked event on August 5th. The changes revealed brought tools like an app launcher on your desktop and the ability to pin apps to your taskbar and Start menu. Well, now that you can actually get a Note20 or Note20 Ultra, Microsoft has started rolling the feature out to the general public and is no longer an "Insider" exclusive. </p>
<p> Microsoft's 'Your Phone' app allows you to connect any Android phone to a Windows 10 PC, but some features require deeper system integration. If you have a Galaxy Note20, you can use your mobile apps from your Windows PC, and the same functionality will be available on the Surface Duo at launch. </p>
<p> Microsoft's Your Phone application enables Android users to take advantage of features like phone calling and controlling music playback right from a PC. In today's Galaxy Unpacked event, Microsoft and Samsung announced a few Samsung-specific improvements to the Your Phone app and teased that the capability to run multiple apps at once will be coming later this year. </p>
<p> No matter how much we slam Apple for its closed ecosystem, many of us often find ourselves raving about how well coordinated the iPhone and Mac are. Then we turn to Android, which just can't do all those tricks, leaving us feeling a little peeved— at least until Microsoft came into the picture. Microsoft has all but adopted Google’s mobile OS after its own phone business crumbled, and it has increasing sought to bridge the deep divide between Windows 10 and Android with the Your Phone app. </p>
<p> If you have a phone paired to your Windows 10 machine with the Your Phone app, you'll be able to take advantage of a small improvement that may be useful to those of you who prefer listening to content on your Android device while you're working on the desktop. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/14 6:30am PDTon Apr 14, 2020 and last updated 2020/04/24 8:36am PDTon Apr 24, 2020. </p>
<p> The Your Phone app from Microsoft is a powerful productivity tool that bridges the gap between Windows and Android for cross-platform interaction. While the basic suite is open to most Android handsets, Microsoft tends to favor Samsung phones with newer features, and such was the case with RCS messaging and screen mirroring. Your Phone is now adding drag and drop for files, which, you guessed it, will again be available exclusively on a handful of Galaxy models. </p>
<p> Microsoft and Samsung partnered up to bring us an enhanced version of the Your Phone service that connects Android phones with Windows machines. The Korean company promised to add even more exclusive improvements to the syncing utility for the Galaxy S20 and the Z Flip, like cross-platform copy and pasting and RCS support. As part of the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Build announcement, the partners took the chance to make good of that word. </p>
<p> Microsoft’s love for Android has only grown over the last few months as the Your Phone app has gotten better and more functional with a bevy of cross-platform capabilities. The Windows maker’s deep partnership with Samsung meant that many of these features came first, and in some cases exclusively, to the latter’s high-end handsets, much like the support for RCS messages announced yesterday. Now, Your Phone will soon add a cross-device copy and paste option, which will only work if you own one of the 2020 Samsung flagships. </p>
<p> It's been about a week since the last release and another new build of Windows 10 Insider has surfaced, bringing along more goodies for Android and Windows PC users. The newest build — version 18999 — updates the Your Phone desktop app with a new "Calls" feature that allows Android users to make and receive phone calls right from the PC. </p>
<p> Microsoft bringing screen mirroring to Your Phone was a big deal since it was supposed to work irrespective of your phone or PC make, unlike some branded applications. Besides ironing out some bugs, the company now wants to make "Phone screen" compatible with more Windows 10 computers. But its approach pulled a classic one step forward, two steps back, as the feature has dropped support for all phones except for some newer Samsung models. </p>

<p> Forget Update Wednesday! Monday is the new big day. Not only were we treated to the latest M preview release and the official Marshmallow name, but a stream of app updates came rushing out after the sun had set on Mountain View. For many of these apps, little changed aside from a few tweaks and touch-ups to support the next major version of Android. Still, there were improvements to be seen on a couple of updates. YouTube received a couple of mostly unimportant modifications to the interface, but it also contains clues about some things we may see in the future. </p>
<p> A couple of months ago, Google brought 360-degree videos to YouTube. While we're still not seeing a lot of multi-directional content popping up, it has certainly warranted some attention, including a fairly lengthy mention during the Google I/O 2015 Keynote presentation. At the time, we learned that YouTube would be adding VR video support for Cardboard later this summer. In a rare turn of events, Google's claim of "later this summer" actually meant it was one week away – or six days, to be exact. </p>
<p> left: old version, right: new version. Note the cardboard symbol next to the timeline </p>
<p> Now, whenever a 360-degree video begins playing, the overlay screen will show the Cardboard logo just to the right of the track bar shortly before the entire overlay fades out. </p>
<p> What everyone thought was an innocent little experiment from Google during last year's I/O has turned into a full-on Virtual Reality venture from the company. Cardboard, a piece of actual cardboard that you fold and insert your phone in for a make-shift low-cost VR display, has been getting more focus and momentum over the past year with 500 compatible apps and over 1 million viewers sold or given away. That rise culminated with a few announcements at yesterday's I/O keynote. </p>
<p> First, the Cardboard hardware has been redesigned to be simpler to disassemble and put together, as well as work with bigger devices that have screens up to 6" in size. </p>

<p> Yesterday's announcement by Samsung of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 might have seemed like something of an echo of the Motorola XOOM. Well, with LG's recent unveiling of the Optimus Pad at MWC, we can still see some resemblance but with a few alterations making it worthy of further attention. </p>
<p> First up, the Optimus Pad refrains from the somewhat popular 10-inch screen diagonal seen on both Motorola and Samsung's tablets. If you have doubts about the handiness of a 10-inch device, it seems that LG shares your sentiments: the Optimus Tab scales the display back to 8.9 inches, while maintaining a similar 1280x760 WXGA resolution. </p>

<p> The current YouTube app for the big screen — the same one you see on Android TV, Fire TV, other smart TVs, video game consoles, and so on — has a pretty simple interface with just four main menu items (Search, Home, Subscriptions, and Library). A makeover is on the way, however, that will see the interface expanded to include a much longer menu list, which may or may not be an improvement. </p>
<p> Google's quirky side rarely shows up these days, but we're always reminded of the company's more fun and personable nature when we come across an Easter egg in its apps and services. The latest to be pointed out to us is in the YouTube app on Android TV and it's a cute corgi that trots along the seek bar, similar to the one we saw in Hangouts a couple of years ago. </p>
<p> YouTube is one of the most used apps on my Shield TV; it's what my husband and I often go to when we want to catch up on videos from our favorite channels. However, two missing features have always annoyed us about the app on Android TV: one is the lack of playback speed controls, and two is the complete absence of ways to add videos to my Watch Later playlist or other lists. The latter functionality is finally rolling out now. </p>
<p> We live in a perpetual server-side microscopic interface change whirlwind. One day you get used to a new interface, the next another one starts popping up, improving some things, worsening others, and generally making our lives a little miserable in the process. But I can't complain, it's part of the reason I have a job, isn't it? The latest new UI we've spotted affects YouTube on Android TV, and it's not all good news. </p>
<p> YouTube's app for Android TV hasn't seen a lot of updates since it switched over to the web wrapper as an interface. However, each new version usually brings something of some importance. The latest release comes with a couple of notable enhancements, including performance improvements, automatic resume after switching apps, and voice commands via Google Assistant. For some people running Android Oreo, there may also be new "personalized channels" appearing in the homescreen. </p>
<p> Google Classroom first showed up on the Play Store in 2015, as an organization tool for teachers and students. The YouTube for Android TV app is a bit older, as it first showed up in 2014, just one day after the Nexus Player went on sale. Now both apps have passed 10 million installs on the Play Store. </p>
<p> The YouTube for Android TV app was updated to version 2.0 last month, with an all-new interface and changes to the video player. While there are a few great aspects of this update, like the new auto-play screen, many users aren't happy with it. </p>
<p> Holy cow, there's an update to the YouTube for Android TV app! It has been a long time–fourteen months, to be precise–and judging by a major bump to the version number, this isn't just a bug fixer. In fact, it carries an entirely redesigned interface, not to mention a few functional changes, as well. This update probably doesn't address many of the requests users have had over the last year, but it's a great step forward and solves at least one major issue: Auto-play. </p>
<p> Android TV is getting some serious attention this week with updates to just about all of the Google apps, including a few that most of us never hear about. An update to YouTube's set-top variant just came out with a few subtle changes. The latest release fills out the interface a bit to make channel subscriptions slightly easier. There are also some new shortcuts and reorganization for Settings, including a toggle to enable Stats for Nerds mode. And YouTube Red subscribers will finally see a visual change when their subscription status is recognized. </p>
<p> What's New </p>
<p> Home screen – Left: old version. Right: new version. </p>
<p> It looks like Google isn't wasting any time laying down a support infrastructure for its new set-top box push. Just one day after the shiny new Nexus Player officially went on sale, the YouTube app for Android TV has been published in the Play Store to enable easy updates without a firmware upgrade. If you happen to be one of the few people with an ADT-1 developer unit from Google I/O or you got lucky with an early delivery of the Nexus Player, you should see the update automatically. </p>
<p> As far as the actual update is concerned, it doesn't add much: YouTube video recommendations have been added to the homescreen, but based on the screenshots in our own Nexus Player review, they seem to be there already. </p>

<p> The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has fundamentally changed how we all do business, take classes, and meet our family members. Many of our streaming apps have had to lower the video quality to spare some bandwidth for the more important stuff. Following Netflix’s lead, YouTube also began capping the video resolution to standard definition on mobile phones. What was supposed to be a temporary restriction for Indian users has now been in place for three months, affecting hundreds of millions, and there's no sign that Google will ease it anytime soon. </p>
<p> Firefox Preview has only received a significant update with version 5.2 with improved tab management and voice search a few days ago, but Mozilla is already working on the next feature-filled update. The unstable Nightly now supports three new add-ons and sees smaller refinements to the three-button overflow menu. The dead-space custom tab bug that's plaguing the current Firefox Preview build is also nowhere to be seen. </p>

<p> youtube messaging </p>
<p> YouTube's built-in Sharing and Messaging system has had a long history: after being privately tested for a many months, it went live in Canada then became official for everyone in August of 2017, and finally was bundled with notifications in the new Activity tab. However, through it all, it has remained a mobile-only feature, available to Android and iOS users. If you were on your desktop, you couldn't share a video with your YouTube contacts easily, see what they sent you, or reply to their messages. That's finally ending now. </p>
<p> When I sit down for a YouTube session, I often think: how cool would it be if I was able to message my friends through YouTube? I don't even have to leave the app/website to do it, and it'd be so much easier if I could message here than on Facebook, Hangouts, or SMS. Awesome! </p>
<p> For some utterly bizarre reason, YouTube is getting in-app messaging. The tab has been appearing on a small number of Android devices over the last 48 hours or so, and Wired published a post explaining the new feature. Apparently, users can get others into the service by inviting them to chat. </p>

<p> YouTube Music is due to become Google's only music service by the end of this year. In anticipation of taking the spotlight, the platform has been rapidly adding features and making tweaks lately, such as the ability to swipe between tracks and start playback directly from the album art. Last month, four new Mix playlists were spotted in the wild, and now it looks like those are becoming more widely available. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/05/20 2:50pm PDTon May 20, 2020 and last updated 2020/06/16 10:55am PDTon Jun 16, 2020. </p>
<p> YouTube Music already has a few Spotify-like dynamic "Mix" playlists, but more might be coming in the future. A new (but, sadly, non-functional) "Focus Mix" playlist has been spotted in the wild, plus a "related" tab loaded with similar artists and other music nestled inside the new pull-out section now-playing interface. </p>

<p> Whenever you purchase a new Chromebook, you can access exclusive perks and freebies that make it even more enjoyable to use. There are several unique perks Google offers that you should take advantage of. Right now, you can get six months of Squid Premium for free (depending on your eligibility), which is both an incredible deal and a must-have Android app for a full-time college student like myself. Google recently threw in YouTube Premium with the perks, and it's a freebie you shouldn't hesitate on. </p>
<p> Google has just announced the launch of a YouTube Music app for the Apple Watch. For folks keeping score at home, that means the streaming service all Google Music users are being forced to migrate to has debuted support for Apple's wearable platform before Google's own Wear OS. This makes the company's priorities pretty clear from where we're standing. </p>
<p> Google Play Music is still superior to YouTube Music for people who just want to listen to their own uploaded songs, even if YouTube Music has been catching up a lot lately. But with the demise of the Google Play Music Manager ahead of the full shutdown, users are left without an automated solution for uploading their local library. That's where an open-source tool comes in: The unofficial YTMusicUploader replicates the Music Manager's capabilities and lets you choose a path on your Windows computer for automatic uploading to YTM. </p>
<p> Bit by bit, Google is stripping Play Music (GPM) away from the service's loyal users, gnawing at every feature and integration, and switching it over to YouTube Music. The latest victim is the Assistant integration which lets you play your music on Home, Nest, and third-party speakers and displays. </p>
<p> When Google started selling music back in 2011, it was a pretty big deal. A lot of changes have happened since then, many of them involving branding. Google Play Music is preparing to be shut down as YouTube Music takes over the reigns as Google's default music streaming platform. It looks like another major step in the transition has taken place today: the music store on Google Play is officially gone. </p>
<p> YouTube Music added support for Android TV earlier this summer, but we weren't very impressed. As the approaching death date for Google Play Music draws closer, YouTube Music will soon replace GPM on TVs. Google is taking this opportunity to introduce new improvements to the YTM experience on TVs, including the ability to play uploaded music and get recommendations right from the homescreen. </p>
<p> YouTube Music may be the latest attempt by Google to infiltrate the music streaming market, but not everyone is happy with the plan to replace Play Music. YTM was spotted testing the ability to play personal playlists via Assistant voice commands earlier this summer, and now it looks like the feature is rolling out more widely — and users can now cast uploaded songs without paying a premium price. </p>
<p> You can't be taken seriously as a music distributor if you don't have the charts to prove it. Newbie on the scene YouTube Music, having gone without charts since its inception, is bringing in all the charts to 57 countries. </p>

<p> Last month, Google added video queuing to the YouTube desktop website, which should have rolled out to most people by now. Since the feature relies on the mini player first and foremost, the company has decided to enhance that miniature video preview with proper playback controls and a maximization shortcut. Google has also improved playlist management so you can share playlists more easily and sort your own by date or most popular. </p>
<p> For a while now the YouTube app on both Android and iOS has allowed users to minimize a playing video into a floating window, letting them browse other content without interrupting playback. A similar floating mode is apparently being tested on the web now. </p>
<p> One of Android Oreo's best features is Picture-in-Picture mode for phones and tablets. When you press the home button while playing media (on an app that supports PiP), the video collapses to a floating window that you can move around the screen. YouTube is one of the few apps that support this feature already, but it's only enabled if you pay for YouTube Red. Thankfully, there is a way to force PiP mode for any app that supports it, including YouTube and Google Maps. </p>

<p> Google apparently has a Material Design UI overhaul in the works for YouTube and it looks pretty good. While it has not yet been pushed to the masses, it is apparently being tested on a small group of users while the developers look for bugs and Google braces for any negative feedback (people hate change, remember). Here's a look at the goods and a way to enable the new UI for yourself. </p>
<p> First, let's look at the homepage. Here's the current version: </p>

<p> you wanna see my stuff </p>
<p> I love gadgets. I remember wandering around the electronics store, checking the specs on every portable radio cassette player, and drooling over an Aiwa one that could play both sides of the tape without requiring manual flipping. I was also the 14-year-old girl who went to the computer shop and had a list of every spec she wanted in her first computer. </p>
<p> Now in my (very) late twenties, that passion hasn't subsided. </p>
<p> When it came time to think about writing a “What We Use” post last year, I was still somewhat new to the AP team and I had just learned that I was about to be the new Teardown guy, so I took a pass on attempting to compile my entire toolset in a single article. I can’t say that I’m any more prepared to do one this year, but I couldn’t resist joining in on the fun. </p>
<p> It's my turn to share what items I use to get stuff done each day, but first, I realize that I have yet to formally introduce myself to you guys. Hello, dear readers. My name is Bertel King, Jr., I'm 24 years old, and I consider myself incredibly fortunate. Back in 2012, I graduated from the second oldest college in the US and married the woman whom I dated for all four of my years there. </p>
<p> I can't believe it's already been a year since the last What We Use, but alas, it has. Basically everything has changed in my device collection since last year, so there's a lot to talk about this go around. Before we get into the stuff you're actually here to see, however, l want to point out that we're going to take a slightly different approach to the What We Use series this time. </p>

<p> yu yuphoria </p>
<p> Since our last LineageOS post, the project has continued to add new features and support new devices. In addition to new Quick Settings tiles and changes to included apps, the ROM now supports 16 additional devices. </p>
<p> As one of the top custom ROMs, CyanogenMod is constantly adding new devices to its stable. Now it's time for these three devices to have their turn in the spotlight. For the Robin and the dual-SIM Desire 816, this is the first appearance they've made on official CyanogenMod pages. The YU Yuphoria has had CM12.1, based on Lollipop 5.1, for a while, but has now made the leap to CM13 and Marshmallow. Without further ado, here are the three new additions to the CM 13 nightlies: </p>
<p> Nextbit Robin (ether) </p>
<p> HTC Desire 816 (a5dwg) </p>
<p> YU Yuphoria (lettuce) </p>
<p> These are nightlies, so bear in mind that the ROMs will likely be unstable and likely to crash, reboot, fry your phone, eat your dog, etc etc. </p>

<p> yu yureka 12s </p>
<p> Aside from the OnePlus One, the YU Yureka is the other Cyanogen-running smartphone that you can buy right now. It recently got its 12 S update to Lollipop 5.0 but is now receiving another OTA with a newer version. Just don't get excited thinking it's Android 5.1, we're still on 5.0 here. The build number has jumped from YNG1TAS0W0 to YNG1TAS1K0, which is dated May 1st 2015. </p>
<p> The changelog sent for this update is simple: "This update provides power improvements and security enhancements for your device." </p>
<p> The second of the two currently-available CyanogenMod phones is receiving its 12S update today in a staged rollout. The Yu Yureka, a Micromax phone, comes just days after the OnePlus One also received Cyanogen's first release to be based on Google's Android 5.0 Lollipop platform. </p>
<p> If you have a Yureka but haven't been able to get the update over the air, a ZIP file with the firmware can be downloaded here (mirror), though it's quite large - nearly 650MB. </p>

<p> z4v </p>
<p> Remember the Verizon Z4v? Me neither [almost]! I even wrote an article about this phone like 2 weeks ago and I still barely remember it. If you want a refresher: the Z4v was basically a Verizon-ified version of the Xperia Z4. Which launched way back in April. There's also that whole "the Z5 now exists" thing, which makes releasing a new Z4 variant kind of pointless and generally a bit silly. </p>
<p> Verizon, in what can only be called a mildly astonishing moment of self-realization and pragmatism, has therefore decided to cancel the phone. Take it away, Albert: </p>
<p> Verizon will no longer be launching Xperia Z4v, however we are committed to supporting Sony Mobile’s product portfolio and will support existing products. </p>
<p> Remember that time Verizon announced it will carry a version of the Xperia Z4 called the Xperia Z4v three months ago? And said it would be out "this summer?" Well, summer ends in exactly... tomorrow, and the phone still isn't out. It was actually allegedly supposed to be released over a month ago, but now any kind of launch before October seems highly unlikely. Some guy got one anyway (somehow) and reviewed it in this video on YouTube. Verizon's site, by the way, says the phone is still "coming soon." </p>
<p> As I hope we can all agree, this is tremendously, mind-bendingly dumb for several reasons. </p>

<p> Everyone was all hyped up about sapphire crystal displays a few years ago, then manufacturers realized what a complete pain in the butt it was to manufacture synthetic sapphire at an industrial scale. There have been a few phones and watches with this super hard material covering the screen, but Zagg offers a "Sapphire Defense" screen protector, too. That makes it sound like a sapphire glass screen protector, and the high price backs that assumption up. However, JerryRigEverything just posted a video revealing it to be nothing more than treated plastic. </p>
<p> It's no secret that I love tablets - I find them to be incredibly useful and fun tools. In fact, I've spent a lot of time as of late reviewing and comparing the most recent additions to the tablet world to one another. As much as I love tablets, though, they're not the best for productivity without some good accessories. Of those accessories, the most useful addition is, without a doubt, a Bluetooth keyboard; truth be told, I actually prefer a good Bluetooth keyboard and stand over the Transformer Series' keyboard dock in most cases - it's just a more portable and convenient option for me. </p>
<p> The stakes for the ZAGGsparq 2.0 aren't low -- after all, the 6000mAh charger won not one, but two innovation awards at CES 2010, and its claim to charge a smartphone up to four times is downright stunning. But underneath the shiny black exterior and all the fancy marketing prose, is it really all that? Well, not quite... </p>
<p> At A Glance </p>
<p> The ZAGGsparq 2.0 features: </p>
<p> 6000mAh of juice </p>
<p> Dual charging ports -- one labeled "general," and the other "optimized" </p>
<p> Compatibility with both phones and tablets </p>
<p> The Good </p>
<p> 6000mAh – It’s not the most powerful or juice-filled portable battery we’ve come across, but with 6000mAh under its hood, the ZAGGsparq 2.0 still isn’t anything to scoff at… at least not on paper. </p>

<p> Zeiss may partner with Nokia now, but the photography company still makes standalone cameras of its own. The Android-powered ZX1 was first announced back in 2018, but it failed to meet its early 2019 launch date. Now it looks like the camera is actually coming soon — and it's got an eye-boggling price tag to boot. </p>
<p> Out of all the Android phones HMD Global has released under its Nokia brand license in the past few years, the Nokia 7.1 seems to have made the best impression in certain western markets like the United States. We're now coming close to a year since its announcement and there's a swell of excitement for an update. Fortunately, we do have some tacit confirmation that the Nokia 7.2 is a thing, thanks to optics supplier ZEISS. </p>
<p> Yesterday in China, HMD Global announced the newest member of its range of Nokia branded Android smartphones. We've seen the wallet-friendly Nokia 3 and 5, the mid-range Nokia 6, and most recently came the flagship Nokia 8. While it might appear that HMD doesn't know how to count, the Nokia 7 announcement at least takes us one step closer to a full house. The Nokia 2 and 9 are on the way soon, too. </p>
<p> The Nokia 7 follows the same pleasing design language as its siblings, but where the Nokia 8 was encased in metal, this new phone goes for a mixture, with an aluminum frame and a vacuum molded back made from Corning Gorilla Glass which curves nicely around the back. </p>
<p> VR doesn't seem to be as exciting these days. Whether it's the limitations of mobile VR (like heat, video quality, and battery drain) or being tethered to your PC with the Rift or Vive, VR doesn't seem that appealing to many people — I, for one, am not one of those, but I digress. To combat some of the weaknesses of both platforms, Zeiss has come up with the VR One Connect, which bridges the gap between mobile and PC virtual reality... in theory. </p>
<p> So far, HMD Global has released three Nokia-branded Android phones - the Nokia 6, 5, and 3. But the most-expensive model, the Nokia 6, still had a mid-range Snapdragon 430 processor. With HMD/Nokia's clean Android ROM and competitive pricing, many hoped for a true flagship model to be released. Now the time has come, as HMD has taken the wraps off the Nokia 8. </p>
<p> HMD Global, maker of the new Android-based Nokia phones, is trying its best to recreate the classic Nokia phone formula. The Nokia 6 is very durable (especially for a phone in its price range), much like some Nokia phones of old. Now, HMD is partnering with Zeiss to improve the cameras on future Nokia phones. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/04/18 9:35am PDTon Apr 18, 2020 and last updated 2020/07/29 10:12am PDTon Jul 29, 2020. </p>
<p> Paying and getting paid is easier than ever, but the various apps you can choose to transact with have their upsides and downsides. Picking one can be difficult, and signing up for all of them even more so — especially when it often means convincing friends and family to do so as well. But old school bank ACH transfer tools are for the birds, and cold, hard cash remains a dicey proposition in the current environment. Splitting the bill with cash is also just a pain, and newer peer to peer (P2P) payment apps are so much more convenient that it's truly silly in 2020 not to be using one. </p>
<p> Various US banks added support for money transfers via Zelle over the last few months, but support is far from universal. Zelle is now available to just about anyone in the US with its new mobile app. If you've got a debit card, odds are you can use Zelle to send money. </p>
<p> Another day, another Venmo competitor. This time we might actually have something worth looking at, though. Zelle — a payment network developed by Early Warning and built on top of ClearXchange — has been announced with integrated support for many different banks and their respective applications, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, US Bank, CitiBank, and Chase (among a huge list of others). These days everyone seems to think they can edge out Venmo, but with bank integration, Zelle might actually be able to do it. </p>
<p> The Bank of America Android app had its material overhaul last year, so it already looks better than a ton of banking apps. However, today it's getting better, with the new ability to send, receive, or request money from almost anyone in your contacts. </p>
<p> Left: before. Right: after. </p>
<p> Previously, money could be sent, but it did not use your phone's address book, and requesting money was difficult. The new feature, however, uses your phone's address book to get emails of the person you want to send money to, or request money from. Sending money is pretty the same as before, or any other service, with the addition of it being able to use anyone of your contact list. </p>

<p> zenfone 2 </p>
<p> ASUS isn't always the best with updates. The company often releases phones with already-outdated software, like the ZenFone 3 Zoom that came with Marshmallow. In a similar vein, the ZenWatch 2 and 3 were some of the last watches to get Android Wear 2.0. But at the ZenFone 4 launch event, ASUS promised that the entire ZenFone 3 and 4 lineup would get Android O. </p>
<p> Asus just announced new ZenFones, but the ZenFone 2 isn't a bad device—especially if you're talking about the ZenFone 2 Deluxe Special Edition. It has the most storage, RAM, and the fastest hardware of any ZF2 variant, and it's on sale today as part of Amazon's Goldbox deal. It usually costs $399, which is not an amount you should pay, but right now it can be yours for just $269. </p>
<p> The Galaxy S III, first released back in 2012, only has official software support up to Android 4.3. No matter: the folks at the CyanogenMod development team are keeping the device alive long after Samsung threw in the towel. Today the AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint variants of the GSIII all get their very first nightly ROM builds for CyanogenMod 13, which is based on Android 6.0. You can find them at the d2att, d2tmo, and d2spr listings on the CM download page, respectively. </p>
<p> A number of Zenfone 2 owners have been making oddly similar complaints about a lack of storage space, and it looks like this isn't a case of poor management on their part. There may be a bug in the device that clogs the internal storage with multiple gigabytes of log files. What's worse, you can't do anything about it without root. </p>
<p> Still looking for that perfect gift? Well, I don't know about perfect, but the Zenfone 2 is pretty cool and it's on sale right now for $30 off the usual $299 price. You can get this deal at most retailers including Amazon, B&H, and the Asus shop. </p>
<p> Think of a smartphone manufacturer. Did you think Asus? Okay, maybe you did, but only because you just read the headline. The company makes phones, but they're hardly the best selling. That said, it attracted a lot of eyeballs this year with the release of the ZenFone 2, an affordable phone offering up to 4GB of RAM. And now Asus has announced that said device will get Android 6.0. </p>
<p> The Asus Zenfone 2 is one of the better mid-range unlocked phones out there thanks to the robust Intel Atom SoC lurking within. Now it looks like there's a new version of this device that ships with 16GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. It's selling for $229, which is a pretty good price for what you get. </p>
<p> As I sit here in a hip Los Angeles coffee shop across from the seemingly never-ending whooshes and rumbles of LA traffic on a busy boulevard just outside the door, I wonder if $4 is a reasonable price for the latte now sitting in front of me. It does have one of those latte art fern-shaped things on it. Or, at least it looks like a fern to me. </p>
<p> While not a tiny amount of money, it doesn't seem totally unreasonable. (And trust me: $4 for a latte is a respectable price in Los Angeles.) After all, I am availing myself the use of said business's counter, its rather lovely interior inspired by the owner's Taiwanese heritage (well, supposedly), a nice ceramic cup for my beverage, and the generally relaxed atmosphere the place provides. </p>
<p> 64GB? Kid's stuff. 128GB? Paltry. Real smartphone spec-hounds will settle for nothing less than 256GB of local onboard storage (which, incidentally, is more than many laptops these days). At least they'd settle for nothing less if any of those phones were actually available. There will be one soon, in at least one location: the ASUS Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special Edition. It's coming to Brazil sometime in the future for an unspecified price, though "quite a lot" would be a safe bet. The model was shown off on the official ASUS Brazil blog. </p>
<p> The Zenfone 2 Deluxe Special Edition is identical to the high-end version of the original Zenfone 2, with 4GB of RAM and a faster Atom Z3580 processor, with the obvious exception of the greater storage capacity. </p>

<p> zenfone 2 199 review </p>
<p> When you think smartphones, ASUS probably rarely comes to mind. While the company has been building Android phones for several years now, their market penetration outside of Asia has been relatively low, and so they rarely get much attention in American or European markets. But the ZenFone 2, when it launched at CES six months ago, definitely raised eyebrows. </p>
<p> At a starting price of just $199, ASUS is offering up a phone with extremely impressive specifications for a do-a-double-take MSRP - it almost sounds too good to be true. Thankfully, I don't think it is - the ZenFone 2 is a solid phone that works pretty much like any Android 5.0+ device you'll encounter while simultaneously blowing the doors off pretty much any competitor at this price point for raw spec sheet power. </p>

<p> Like many manufacturers, ASUS has its own Android skin - ZenUI. Version 4.0 of the skin was introduced alongside the company's ZenFone 4 lineup, but ASUS also promised to bring the new version to the existing ZF3 series. The update process has now begun, with the ZF3 Zoom becoming the first device to be updated. </p>
<p> ASUS isn't always the best with updates. The company often releases phones with already-outdated software, like the ZenFone 3 Zoom that came with Marshmallow. In a similar vein, the ZenWatch 2 and 3 were some of the last watches to get Android Wear 2.0. But at the ZenFone 4 launch event, ASUS promised that the entire ZenFone 3 and 4 lineup would get Android O. </p>
<p> Asus sort of missed the boat with the ZenFone 3 line, which took ages to come out in the US and then wasn't very competitive with other devices. The ZenFone 3 Deluxe was priced similarly to the OnePlus 3, but it wasn't as good. Asus isn't pretending the phone never happened, though. This phone is getting an Android 7.0 update, the first wide rollout of Nougat for Asus. </p>
<p> We're finally getting to the point where Nougat software updates are coming at a steady clip from manufacturers. ASUS is getting in a few for its midrange phone hardware - just last week we saw the ZenFone 3 Deluxe get its software update (that really should have come out in December at the latest). Now it's the non-deluxe model's turn, specifically the ZE520KL and ZE552KL variants. Those are the 5.2- and 5.5-inch versions of the unlocked GSM phone, if you haven't memorized the alphabet soup of those model numbers. </p>
<p> Asus announced the ZenWatch 3 several weeks ago, but neglected to provide information on when you could buy one. Irksome, but nothing compared to the Zenfone 3 that was available in some markets over the summer. Well, now you can finally plan to pick up both, if that's something you want to do. The ZenWatch 3 and all Zenfone 3 variants will be available in the coming weeks, but pricing on the Zenfone 3 is a little higher than expected. </p>
<p> We first heard about the newest additions to the ZenFone lineup back in late May, but ASUS didn't elaborate on availability for the United States. The ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe and ZenFone 3 Laser are now available to buy on Amazon for $530.48 and $206.95, respectively. However, they still won't ship for at least two weeks (if Amazon's information is correct). </p>
<p> The original ZenFone would be two years old this month, but I doubt many of them are still in use. It was highly anticipated before release, and widely panned shortly thereafter. I have friends who bought the first generation ZenFone, and the issues were obvious right from the start: the battery couldn't last half a day, the UI was clumsy and unresponsive, it got so hot you could barely hold it, and the build quality and design really weren't up to par. </p>
<p> A lot has changed in the last two years. The ZenFone 2 was well-received by our team and continues to be a good buy for the price. </p>
<p> Asus already has three different versions of the ZenFone 3 planned in fast food-style denominations: vanilla, Deluxe, and Ultra. The Deluxe is the highest-specced version ("Ultra" is about a bigger screen, not better specs), as it's equipped with the latest and greatest Snapdragon 820 processor. Of course that's no longer the latest and greatest: Qualcomm announced the even faster Snapdragon 821 just yesterday. Not to be outdone, a new version of the ZF3 Deluxe has been announced via a Taiwanese press release. </p>
<p> Johnny Shih, ASUS's enthusiastic chairman, today introduced the ZenFone 3 to the world (even though we reported on the ZenFone 4, 5, and 6 two years ago). Alongside the standard ZenFone 3, there are two other variants; the Deluxe and the Ultra. </p>
<p> ZenFone 3 </p>
<p> The ZenFone 3 is certainly a pretty phone. As with other ASUS products, it keeps the spun aluminum design, with glass covering the metal. A 5.5-inch 1080p display adorns the front of the device. ASUS is boasting a 77% screen-to-body ratio, which is impressive - it's stuck with the ZenFone 2's capacitive, hardware buttons too, utilising that bottom bezel space. </p>

<p> zenfone 5 lite </p>
<p> ASUS's latest generation of ZenFones was introduced at MWC in February, and three months later, we're finally starting to hear about US availability. The ZenFone 5Q, which is called the ZenFone 5 Lite in other markets, has arrived stateside for $299. It can be purchased from B&H, Best Buy, Newegg, and several other retailers. </p>
<p> ASUS' Android phones might slide under the radar for most, but the company's new ZenFone 5 series probably won't. The company has had some trouble historically trying to penetrate the US phone market to any great depth—perhaps a result of its crowded, sometimes confusing product portfolio—but nonetheless it persists. Some of its phones have even been pretty good. But now that the wraps have been taken off its latest line of phones, it seems like ASUS has found a successful way to attract the attention it wanted: by copying the iPhone X's notch. </p>
<p> Asus, as we expected, showed off the new ZenFone 5 family at MWC. Unlike years past, the Taiwanese company is keeping in step with modern smartphone trends, in some cases to the point of plain copying the iPhone X. Regardless, some of the new devices look fantastic and our initial impressions are relatively positive. </p>
<p> It seems like Asus loves to create a muddled, crowded mobile product portfolio. While this strategy might work in the PC hardware space (where the Taiwanese company has plenty of respect, including from me), it just confuses and frustrates smartphone consumers. We already saw a possible leak a few days ago about one model in Asus' upcoming ZenFone 5 line, even though the ZenFone 4 family is still quite new, and now Evan Blass has shown off an image of the ZenFone 5 Lite over on Twitter. </p>

<p> zenfone max </p>
<p> Asus has promised to release Android Marshmallow for many of its ZenFone devices by the second quarter of 2016 and it seems to be rushing now to make good on its deadline. The first device to get the update was the ZenFone 2 Laser ZE500KL and ZE550KL, and today another model joins it: the ZenFone Max. </p>
<p> The ZenFone Max isn't just good enough to star in a series of speed rapping videos, it's also great if you want a phone that lasts for two days straight thanks to a hefty 5000mAh battery. This update that it should start receiving OTA today is version WW_13.8.26.31. </p>
<p> Operating system updates don't come quickly in the Android world. They show up fashionably late, nevermind that parties where everyone looks forward to a new software release aren't the kind where people care how anyone is dressed. </p>
<p> ASUS is now doing its users a solid. No, it's not pushing out over-the-air updates to all of its devices right this moment. But it is doing the next best thing, which is listing which phones will get the update. </p>
<p> ASUS is riding high on ZenFone Fever, and at an event in India called - wait for it - Zenfestival, the company announced a slew of new ZenFone models. ZenFone 2 Deluxe, ZenFone 2 Laser, ZenFone Selfie, and ZenFone Max. Well, actually, only one of them was new - the ZenFone Max. The Laser, Deluxe, and Selfie were all announced previously, but the Max is the only really interesting one anyway (it even has a laser, don't worry). </p>
<p> The ZenFone Max is clearly targeted at emerging markets, blending an extremely large 5000mAh battery (how thick is this phone?) with a much more modest Snapdragon 410 processor, compared to the speedy if power-hungry Intel Atoms in the standard ZenFone 2. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/zenfone-selfie/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17483486" filename="zenfone-selfie">
<p> After the ZenFone Max and a couple of variants of the ZenFone 2 Laser, ASUS is now starting to roll out Android 6.0 Marshmallow to the ZenFone Zoom (ZX551KL) and ZenFone Selfie (ZD551KL). </p>
<p> The ZenFone Zoom is moving to firmware version 4.21.40.74 while the Zenfone Selfie is going up to 21.40.0.1692. Both devices are shedding a lot of preloaded apps (read: bloat) and gaining a couple of new apps from Google and/or Facebook. </p>
<p> I'm pretty sure something was lost in translation between the different reviews of ASUS' more recent generations of phones and the company's software development team. Everyone has lamented the high customization of ZenUI, the software layer that ASUS has slapped on top of Android, and its endless list of pre-installed and useless apps. On our own team, different writers unanimously pointed to the software as the major drawback for the Zenfone 2, Zenfone 2E, Zenpad S 8.0, Zenfone Selfie, and Zenfone 2 Laser. So what's ASUS to do to fix that? </p>
<p> Add more bloat. For realsies. That's what's happening with the latest update to the Zenfone Selfie, as if the phone wasn't full of preloaded crapware already. </p>
<p> Operating system updates don't come quickly in the Android world. They show up fashionably late, nevermind that parties where everyone looks forward to a new software release aren't the kind where people care how anyone is dressed. </p>
<p> ASUS is now doing its users a solid. No, it's not pushing out over-the-air updates to all of its devices right this moment. But it is doing the next best thing, which is listing which phones will get the update. </p>
<p> Today at a press event during Computex, ASUS announced many new Android products, and I'm guessing you'll be intrigued by at least one of them. </p>
<p> ZenWatch 2 </p>
<p> Let's get to the headliner: the big news with the ZenWatch 2 is that it now comes in two sizes - 37mm and 41mm (width). The smaller 37mm sports an 18mm strap, with the 41mm having a larger 22mm band. Both have AMOLED dipslays with Gorilla Glass 3, IP67 dust and water resistance, magnetic charging cables, and use unspecified Qualcomm processors (likely still a Snapdragon 400). The ZenWatch 2 has a crown now, too, which ASUS says adds functionality, but isn't exactly specifying how just yet. </p>

<p> zenfone zoom </p>
<p> Memorial Day weekend is nigh upon us, so seeing some sales pop up is not surprising. Tonight, we have one courtesy of B&H. You can get an Asus ZenFone Zoom for $179.99 with a free ZenPower 10,500mAh portable battery pack. That's a respectable savings of $170, with sales tax only applying to New York/New Jersey residents. </p>
<p> Unlocked phones are great. You can take them to whichever carrier you desire, you usually have greater control over software modification, and you don't have to deal with contracts. Amazon seems to think so, too; as a result, it's running an "Amazon Unlocked Phone Event" that starts today, with discounts on Sony Xperia, LeEco, Lenovo, ASUS, and Coolpad smartphones. </p>
<p> Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but tons of great deals are still out there. Case in point: ASUS's photography-oriented ZenFone Zoom is on sale from both B&H and Newegg for $199. That's the same deal that ASUS offered on Black Friday, and a whopping $200 off its MSRP of $399, effectively making the phone half-price. </p>
<p> After the ZenFone Max and a couple of variants of the ZenFone 2 Laser, ASUS is now starting to roll out Android 6.0 Marshmallow to the ZenFone Zoom (ZX551KL) and ZenFone Selfie (ZD551KL). </p>
<p> The ZenFone Zoom is moving to firmware version 4.21.40.74 while the Zenfone Selfie is going up to 21.40.0.1692. Both devices are shedding a lot of preloaded apps (read: bloat) and gaining a couple of new apps from Google and/or Facebook. </p>
<p> What do you do when your phone is running low on battery and you must make a phone call because the wife expects you to do some grocery shopping before you get home or because your tummy has started rumbling and your only path to salvation is through the gooey cheese-stuffed crusts of a pepperoni pizza? </p>
<p> Well, you either whip out your speed rapping skills that you innately acquired that very moment to blast through an entire conversation in a few seconds, or you wish you were using an ASUS Zenfone Max with its 5000mAh battery to never, ever, have that problem in the first place. </p>
<p> Owners of some of Asus' camera-oriented smartphones are getting a nice surprise today with the announcement of sizable OTA updates. The OS version isn't changing, but both the Zenfone Zoom and Zenfone Laser 2 are getting big updates with tweaks, new features, and bug fixes galore. </p>
<p> Operating system updates don't come quickly in the Android world. They show up fashionably late, nevermind that parties where everyone looks forward to a new software release aren't the kind where people care how anyone is dressed. </p>
<p> ASUS is now doing its users a solid. No, it's not pushing out over-the-air updates to all of its devices right this moment. But it is doing the next best thing, which is listing which phones will get the update. </p>
<p> It wasn’t long ago that ASUS, while beloved by many on the desktop computing scene, was hardly a player when it came to smartphones. Some early Android tablet adopters will remember their Transformer books, but the ZenFone line is relatively new and has been the most serious attempt by ASUS to break into phones. It would be easy to overstate the popularity of the ZenFone, especially in western markets, but there’s no doubt that lovers of Android now have ASUS on their radar. </p>
<p> We at Android Police have looked at several ZenFones and the latest entry is the ZenFone Zoom, which is a characteristic mixture of uniqueness, ambition, value, and zaniness that we have seen before. </p>
<p> Asus announced the ZenFone Zoom over a year ago, but despite how long the phone has taken to arrive stateside (after having long ago launched in other parts of the world), the phone is still a unique piece of hardware. Optical zoom is a rare thing to find in a smartphone camera, as is the dedicated camera button. </p>

<p> zen pinball </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we have a new licensed pinball game from Zen, a stylish take on Minesweeper, two retro-inspired platformers, another Sparke "life" game, a simplified brawler, and a connect-the-dots puzzle game. Without further ado: </p>
<p> Are you a fan of cartoons produced, owned, and distributed by Fox Broadcasting Company? Hey, then it's your lucky day—well, unless you don't like pinball. Zen Pinball now has tables based on Bob's Burgers, Archer, Family Guy, and American Dad. </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got several PC and console pilgrims including Hotline Miami, War Thunder, and Always Sometimes Monsters, a new Portal-inspired Zen Pinball table, a mashup of tactic, RPG, and city-building, and standard platformers and puzzlers. </p>
<p> After Star Wars, Marvel, and The Walking Dead, it seems like just about any property is fair game for Zen Studios' expanding pinball franchise. The latest addition is South Park, Comedy Central's foul-mouthed animated show now in its 18th season. As usual with Zen Pinball expansions, you can get the two new 3D tables as either a stand-alone paid app or as in-app purchase expansions to the original game. The separate app is $4, or each table is $2, so it works out the same. </p>
<p> The first table is just general South Park stuff, featuring a staggering number of characters, references, scene items, and voice clips from the show. </p>

Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a stylish platformer, a high-tech space fighter, a superhero novel-book, a turn-based roguelike, and a zombie pinball table. Without further ado: </p>
<p> Oscura: Second Shadow </p>
<p> The sequel to the well-regarded Oscura uses the overdone black foreground aesthetic for more than just ambiance: the sole source of light in most levels is your impish character's glowing hand. </p>
<p> If you're the kind of fan that absolutely must have a Star Wars version of everything in your life, then grab your officially licensed Ahsoka Tano phone case and head for the Play Store. Zen Studios, makers of the well-received Zen Pinball HD, have released their Star Wars-themed pinball app, creatively titled Star Wars Pinball. It's a reasonable $1.99, but unfortunately restricted to Android 4.0 devices and above, and thus tragically off-limits to the Special Edition R2-DROID2. </p>
<p> The game comes with the Empire Strikes Back table, and the Boba Fett and Clone Wars (The Cartoon Network series, not the lamentable prequel) tables can be downloaded for another two dollars each. </p>

<p> Wireless chargers come in several shapes and sizes over the years, from stands to pucks and even orbs, but the mechanics behind how they work can make them kind of a pain. Positioning needs to be just so, or the coil on your gadget won't line up with the coil in the charger, and nothing happens. Multi-coil chargers have been a thing for a while, but the new Zens Liberty steps things up drastically, with sixteen coils stacked and staggered across its face. You can pretty much just dump your phone wherever, and it'll charge. It even looks pretty dang snazzy if you opt for the glass-topped version, but you'll pay €199.99 (around $215 right now) for that privilege. </p>
<p> Wireless chargers use a big coil to create the field that actually charges your device, which is why placing your phone in just the right spot is usually necessary. Some chargers use multiple coils to increase the working area of the charger, but the new Zens Liberty sports a ridiculous 16-coil configuration that can charge up to two devices at once in any position, with up to 15W of output each. The company is even taking that level of overkill just a little bit further by offering a special edition model with a glass top so you can see all 16 coils. </p>

<p> zenwatch 3 </p>
<p> After the last deal alert, this one might feel a bit anticlimactic — after all, I did say that Samsung's smartwatches are the ones to buy if you're interested in that product segment. But if your heart is set on Android Wear, and bless your soul, then this sale on Asus' ZenWatch 3 might interest you. The best Android Wear watch is currently $179.99, a nice $50 off. </p>
<p> It has been about five months since Android Wear 2.0 was released, but a few major watches still don't have the update. The ZenWatch 2 and 3 are two wearables that have waited months for it, and while ZW2 owners will have to keep waiting, it has finally arrived for the ZenWatch 3. </p>
<p> Looking for a nice, stylish smartwatch? If so, you may want to have a look at the ASUS ZenWatch 3, which we called "the best Android Wear device you can get" in our review. Amazon will now sell you a ZW3 for as little as $194.99, which is the lowest price we've ever seen there. </p>
<p> When Google listed all of the watches that would receive Android 2.0, I was surprised. I only expected a handful of wearables to make the jump, but nearly all of them (besides the earliest models) were marked as compatible. Unfortunately, it's taking a while to deliver on that promise; fast forward five months later, and a few models are still waiting on an update. </p>
<p> Android Wear 2.0 was officially released in February, but many watches are still waiting on an official update. The ZenWatch 2 and 3 were confirmed to get the new version (the original ZenWatch was left out), but last we heard, it would come sometime in Q2 2017. Now the rollout seems to be in full swing, at least for the ZenWatch 3. </p>
<p> In one of those not-so-surprising pieces of news this morning, Digitimes reported that Asus might be throwing in the towel on Android Wear. Despite the slight revitalization we've seen throughout this year, the sales numbers for the ZenWatch line are not looking good. </p>
<p> Both the ASUS ZenWatch 2 and 3 were confirmed to receive the Android Wear 2.0 update back earlier this month. While a few weeks of waiting are to be expected with major update rollouts, ASUS says ZenWatch owners will have to wait a while longer. </p>
<p> Although Android Wear 2.0 has been put off until "early 2017," ASUS isn't waiting for the update to deliver its own improvements and fixes. The company has released OTA updates for the ZenWatch 2 and ZenWatch 3, with some exciting new features (well, for ZW3 owners). </p>
<p> Asus has been one of the more persistent promoters of Android Wear since it was released. As other companies have scaled back on wearables, Asus is full speed ahead with a third-generation ZenWatch. The first ZenWatch was a solid addition to the initial wave of watches, and the ZenWatch 2 had some appeal due to the extremely competitive price. Both those watches had the same rounded square body and general aesthetic, but the ZenWatch 3 is a radical departure. This is a completely round watch—no flat tire—and it makes more tweaks to the UI of Android Wear than any watch I've used before. </p>
<p> At the beginning of the month, Asus announced that its latest Android Wear offering, the ZenWatch 3, would be available in the early part of November. It looks like the company came through with its promise. The ZenWatch 3 is now available to order for $229 through the Asus store and B&H. I daresay that this looks like a very nice piece. </p>

<p> Building on the success of their cloud storage aggregator ZeroPC Cloud Navigator, ZeroDesktop introduced ZeroPC Photo Connect to Google's Play Store today. The app works on the same premise as its forebear, Photo Connect pulls together all your photos from popular storage services, ranging from Picasa to Facebook to Dropbox, Evernote, and Photobucket. </p>
<p> Besides offering access to your various photo storage services, Photo Connect brings photos together into a tiled "timeline" interface, allowing users to browse through photos from all sources at once, according to when they were uploaded. </p>
<p> ZeroPC is this crazy service that lets you access all the popular cloud services from one place. "All the popular cloud services" is shorthand for Box.net, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, Flickr, Google Docs, Instagram, Picasa and SugarSync. Yeah, everything. </p>
<p> The website is insane. They've whipped up an in-browser operating system. Imagine a Linux-based OS in your browser. That's exactly what the website looks like. </p>
<p> However, this is an Android blog, so we should probably focus on the freshly-released Android Tablet (only) app. </p>

<p> By now we've already seen the PlayStation Phone in a video or two, a number of pictures, and the usual batch of rumors. However, one of the few things we haven't known about the device is what its camera will be like. Well as of today, you can officially cross camera quality off the list of unknowns - four pictures taken by a certain "Sony Ericsson Zeus" have just hit Picasa: </p>
<p> A little digging revealed that all of these pictures were captured by a 5MP camera (with an aperture rating of 2.4 and a focal length of 4.1mm), and as the second one shows, it is indeed accompanied by a flash. </p>
<p> Well, this one's a bit special, isn't it? In a marked shift from the traditional blurrycam espionage, what we have here is a nice, calmly filmed tour of the no-longer-mythical Zeus device. While there isn't a great deal of new information presented in the video, we do catch a glimpse of a PlayStation icon in the menus. The software is labeled Gingerbread in the About screen, despite a distinctly Froyo-esque appearance. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/09/11 9:00am PDTon Sep 11, 2020 and last updated 2020/10/08 7:45am PDTon Oct 8, 2020. </p>
<p> I started out as a folding phone critic. In fact, I bought the Z Flip we reviewed this spring with the full intention of pointing out how dumb the idea was, except I was dead wrong. I fell in love with my little flip phone, and the last week spent with the Galaxy Z Fold2 has further cemented my change of heart. Folding phones are undeniably the future, and for the right folks, the Z Fold2 is a must-buy game-changer — though probably not for you. </p>
<p> I really can't stress enough how game-changing folding phones are. I know they're frequently (and fairly) criticized for things like display durability and price, but once you actually use one and understand the experience, something just clicks — or, at least, it did for me. They're still not for everyone, but if you absolutely need to maintain productivity on the go, then the Z Fold2 will be as disruptive to your idea of work as the early Blackberry phones were. In fact, to prove a point, I was able to do my entire job here at Android Police from the phone for most of a whole day. </p>
<p> This story was originally published 2020/09/02 12:27pm PDTon Sep 2, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/05 11:17am PDTon Sep 5, 2020. </p>
<p> The Galaxy Z Fold2 is easily the most exciting Samsung smartphone of 2020, and maybe the most exciting smartphone of 2020 period. While I'm saving judgment for our final review of the Fold2 (coming soon), I do have some initial thoughts for folks considering a pre-order. And in short, I feel pretty positive about the phone so far. </p>
<p> After endless leaks and the company's own teasing, Samsung has officially unveiled the Galaxy Z Fold2 at its "Unpacked Part 2" event today. The successor to last year's Galaxy Fold packs plenty of improvements over the revamped and re-released original, including a more durable design, a folding glass and polymer display, a faster chipset, and bigger screens both inside and out. Those hoping to jump into foldables with this new generation will need to double-check their savings accounts, though, as the Z Fold2 comes in a wallet-destroying $1,999, with pre-orders opening tomorrow at 12:01 AM on September 2nd ahead of general availability on September 18th. </p>
<p> Samsung is all set to fully unveil its latest foldable phone at an Unpacked event on September 1, but there's seemingly very little about the device they'll be able to tell us that we don't already know. Images, videos, and specs have all leaked or been shared one way or another, but we now have potentially definitive information from a very reputable source. But we now have definitive confirmation of the price from Samsung itself, at least in the UK. </p>
<p> As promised back at Samsung's August 5th Unpacked event, the company is gearing up for another event on September 1st. The sequentially titled "Unpacked Part 2," looks to be all about the company's next folding phone: The Z Fold2. Mark your calendars for 10AM ET (7AM PT). </p>
<p> Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold2 5G is now official. Rocking a Z Flip-style redesigned hinge, big folding 7.6" display (augmented by a smaller 6.2" Cover Screen), the phone will come in two colors, potentially including some hinge color customization options, as well as a Thome Browne edition. Reservations for the folding phone/tablet are also now open on Samsung's site. More official details are coming September 1st, together with pre-orders. In the meantime, Max Weinbach has spilled the beans. </p>

<p> Looking for a cheap (read: free) way to get your digital magazine fix? Zinio has extended its $50 digital 'zine credit promo until the end of this month, and you can cash in on this offer right here (you have to make a new Zinio account). Zinio also has an Android app (Play Store link below), so you can read said digital magazines on pretty much any modern Android device. </p>
<p> As I said, this offer only lasts until the end of the month, so get it while the getting is good. </p>
<p> One of the best things about having a tablet is that it can take the place of many other, usually not-so-techy, things in our lives. Paper products like newspapers and magazines, for example, are easily replaceable with a simple application. Zinio is a popular newsstand app that aims to take the place of the latter, and while it has only been in the Android Market for a short amount of time, it just received an update that makes it even more desirable. </p>

<p> Earlier today, Android Central caught word that the Epic and Zio would receive an over-the-air (OTA) update to Froyo on February 21, but had nothing more than copied and pasted text from the Sprint system. Fast forward a few hours, and we now have more concrete evidence in the form a screenshots from Sprint's internal system that confirm the update is coming: </p>
<p> The image is courtesy of XDA member bentiger, and confirms his earlier statement that there was a Sprint internal announcement that the updates were rolling out: </p>
<p> I just saw an official release from Sprint Dealer News. </p>
<p> The first two of Sprint's latest three-phone, mid-range lineup are now arriving to various Sprint retailers, such as Best Buy, sprint.com, Wirefly.com, and others. While they aren't the powerhouses that we've gotten used to, the Sanyo Zio and the Samsung Transform are good introductory-level Android devices for people who want to dump their feature phones for smartphones without having to shell out the big bucks. They are joining the ranks of Sprint's other low-to-mid-range phones, such as the Samsung Intercept and the HTC Hero. </p>
<p> Assuming this leaked image is real, Sprint has got two new Android devices in store for its customers, although one of them is hardly new at all: the Kyocera Zio, which will be branded as the Sanyo Zio, and the Samsung Transform, which appears to be another Android device, perhaps even from the Galaxy S series. </p>
<p> The Zio probably won't fire anybody up; it was announced last March, and even then it was considered a mid-range phone. </p>
<p> Fresh off the press, i.e. the first day of the CTIA Wireless 2010 trade show, Kyocera announced its return into the smartphone business with, as you already guessed, a new Android device - the Zio M6000. </p>
<p> trackball </p>
<p> ambient light sensor, accelerometer, WiFi, and all the standard Android business </p>
<p> No word on the CPU type and frequency, included memory card size, supported carriers (though it was clarified to be CDMA. </p>

<p> Total Commander (or Windows Commander back in the 90s) is one of the best-known orthodox file managers out there and made the jump to Android back in 2012 (check out our hands-on for some nostalgia). Version 2 followed soon after in the same year, and apart from a visual update to make it fit better within Holo and Material Design, the basic interface has been the same up until today. Version 3,0, which has been in beta since 2018, doesn't change that, but at least it packs a slew of new features compared to Total Commander 2.91. </p>
<p> Google Assistant was introduced at Google I/O last year, as a more personal voice assistant than Google Now. Since then, it has been made available on several platforms - Pixel phones, the Google Home, Android TV, and Allo. But Assistant is still unavailable on non-Pixel phones without a special build.prop tweak. Now the Open GApps team has made enabling Assistant a little easier. </p>
<p> In part two of our series on manually flashing OTAs to Android Wear devices, we're going to take a look at the Asus ZenWatch. </p>
<p> Prerequisites </p>
<p> Before beginning, make sure you have the following: </p>
<p> The latest Google USB driver and platform tools, both of which can be installed via the Android SDK. </p>
<p> The OTA ZIP file that you want to flash. </p>
<p> How To Flash </p>
<p> Go into the Settings app on your watch, then scroll down to "About," and tap on it. </p>
<p> Scroll down to the build number and repeatedly tap on it until you see a toast notification telling you that you are now a developer. </p>
<p> Veteran Android users, particularly those who stick to Nexus devices, are well aware of the fact that you can usually flash OTA updates manually once someone pulls a link to the actual update file. This normally provides a much better option than waiting for your device to get the update sent to it, which could take weeks. Android Wear has this functionality as well, but each watch is a little different in terms of proper procedures for doing so. We're going to run a series of posts on how to manually flash updates to each Android Wear device that supports it (sorry, Moto 360 users) in the hopes of providing some clarity on the issue. </p>
<p> If you went to Google I/O 2014, you probably treasure the ADT-1, the first Android TV set-top box that was never made available for retail purchase. It's also the first Android TV device to be updated to version 5.0.2... out of an admittedly limited field at the moment. LRX22G contains a few small changes to the core of the system for a few easy performance improvements, but nothing dramatic, so don't sweat it if you aren't part of the initial OTA rollout. </p>
<p> If you just can't wait, here's the OTA ZIP file - you'll need an unmodified ADT-1 and a PC to flash the file with via the ADB interface. </p>
<p> The OnePlus One is receiving another OTA today - one I'm probably more excited about than any other OTA the company has released so far. Mostly because unlocking the phone and using apps has deteriorated into a constant battle with an unresponsive and very moody touchscreen. Supposedly, this update should resolve this pretty major flaw, along with a few other things which I've detailed below, including the poor battery life we covered recently. </p>
<p> Of course, as usual, we have the OTA file for those of you who don't want to wait for the slow rollout to hit them. </p>
<p> There's a reason major device updates tend to roll out in stages. Some of the earlier recipients of the OnePlus One's big July OTA were hit with a bug where the PIN unlock screen did not display properly. OnePlus hasn't wasted any time hopping on this issue, and they're now pushing out a hotfix to the limited people who received the first OTA already and those who have flashed manually. </p>
<p> This update is so small that the version number remains the same, XNPH30O. Below we've shared the files for people who already downloaded the July update, as well as the full OTA zip for people who haven't updated yet and want to do everything in one go. </p>
<p> The fashionably late July over-the-air update for the OnePlus One that bumps the handset up to Android 4.4.4 is beginning to roll out as of now and will continue through the end of the week (it's staged, with 10% rolling out first). In addition to new versions of Google apps, the update contains a cooler calibration for its screen and fixes that stop the phone from activating off-screen gestures while in your pocket. </p>
<p> There's also a new Clear Image camera feature that stitches together over 10 individual photos to produce an image with a higher resolution. Here is a comparison shot with the photo of interest positioned on the right. </p>
<p> The CyanDelta Updater app now has support for Paranoid Android, so users of that ROM can join the likes of their CyanogenMod or OmniROM running peers in avoiding that beefy ROM update each night. Keeping up with the nightly Joneses typically requires downloading a sizable update daily, but CyanDelta addresses this situation by only pulling down delta files, which contain just the part of each update that has actually changed. The premise is simple: why download an entire ROM each day if you can simply get what's new? </p>
<p> To dive in, you must first download the .zip file for whichever ROM you want to run (as long as it's CyanogenMod, OmniRom, or Paranoid Android). </p>
<p> While the majority of Nexus and GPE devices have received their Android 4.4.3 OTAs relatively quickly, the rollout for certain other devices has certainly been... unusual. We still haven't heard anything about the 2013 Nexus 7 LTE, the LG G Pad 8.3 GPE, or the Moto G GPE, and until today, the OTA for the 2012 Nexus 7 Wi-Fi (I've been waiting for it to post both Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi+3G links together). </p>
<p> As they say, better late than never, but I'm sure owners of the abovementioned phones and tablets are not thrilled, especially those with Nexus 7s LTE that have received neither factory images nor OTAs. </p>

<p> zizo </p>
<p> It's insane how case manufacturers want to charge consumers for a simple phone case. OtterBox, for instance, wants a whopping $60 for a Defender, a case that isn't even out yet for LG's new V30. But if you like saving a ton of money and still want a tough MIL-STD 810.1G-compliant product, look no further than Zizo's BOLT, STATIC, and ION cases for the V30. Each of the three cases offers great value, and at least one is bound to fit your needs. </p>
<p> The Samsung Galaxy Note8 is really expensive. $900 is quite a lot of money, especially for something as fragile as a smartphone. One drop could mean the end of your shiny new device, or at least a very expensive repair job. Thankfully, Zizo makes some fantastic cases for the Note8 (they're even available on Amazon), and we're giving away 30 of their Zizo BOLT cases! </p>
<p> As you all know, the Galaxy Note8 is not a cheap phone. $900+ is a sizable chunk of cash for anyone, and it would really suck to damage such a pricey device in a fall because you are using a cheap, crappy case, or - gasp - going naked. Note 8 buyers, don't let this happen to you; get yourself a great case from Zizo. They've got four excellent options to choose from in the BOLT, ION, ATOM, and STATIC. Three of them even come with a tempered glass screen protector designed to fit perfectly with the case. </p>

<p> Z Launcher </p>
<p> Nokia's Z Launcher is a bit different. Instead of a customizable homescreen where you place your app icons, it chooses them based on the ones you often open and you're most likely to need right now. Essentially, it adapts to your context. It has a few more tricks too, like scribbling the names of apps, contacts, and websites to launch them directly. In its new update, this scribble function is about to get a little more powerful. </p>
<p> Scribbling now supports synonyms, so you can launch music apps by simply writing music. Spotify, Pandora, and even YouTube should appear in the list of options. </p>
<p> Earlier this year, Nokia surprised everyone by developing an interesting Android app called Z Launcher. Back then, it was only available for beta participants as an APK download on Nokia's website. Today, along with its Android N1 tablet announcement at Slush 2014, the company has revealed that Z Launcher is making its official debut on the Play Store. </p>
<p> If you haven't tried Z Launcher before, you should think of it as Yahoo's Aviate with Google Gesture Search running on top. Basically, Z Launcher doesn't just work as a regular homescreen replacement where you organize your apps and widgets in a static layout. Instead, it will look for patterns in your behavior throughout the day, including the apps you launch, the people you call, and the websites you browse, and surface them to you to anticipate your needs. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/zoe/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17483888" filename="zoe">
<p> zoe </p>
<p> Zoes are little video highlights that are similar to GIFs but tend to be longer, so don't call them that. The functionality launched as an HTC exclusive back in the days of the original HTC One. Then things opened up to other devices as the manufacturer expanded Zoe into a social network of sorts. Along the way some things changed, like the ability to create Zoes locally. </p>
<p> Well, Zoe 2.0 is now available in the Play Store, and it lets you create things on your device rather than using the cloud again. But, and this is a pretty decent but, you can only create Zoes locally on HTC devices. </p>
<p> HTC Zoe is a social network of sorts built around video highlights. According to the latest update's changelog, the app now works on devices running the latest version of Google's mobile operating system, including the Nexus 6 and the Nexus 9. Here it is on my updated HTC One M7. </p>
<p> That's not all this release has in store. The list of changes includes a new highlight engine that enables new themes, effects, and transitions. It also brings in support for higher-quality video, and you're able to download your own high-definition Zoes to your device.The discovery feed has apparently retrieved a tweak or two, but overall, the experience still looks largely the same. </p>
<p> During its Double Exposure event yesterday, HTC announced that it was bringing Zoe out of beta and expanding it to all Android devices running Android 4.3 or higher. It also intends to bring the service to the iPhone later this fall. The company clearly has large plans for something that began as a camera perk exclusively available on a small number of its devices. Zoe has become a social network, and HTC wants as many people to use it as possible. </p>
<p> Zoe began as the ability to take a series of photos in rapid succession and string them together into short videos that resembled animated GIFs. </p>
<p> HTC has just updated the Zoe app in Google Play with support for a few non-HTC phones, but support will supposedly expand soon. The Zoe app isn't the same as HTC's Zoe camera feature in the HTC One, but it might still be interesting if you're down with making and sharing videos. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/zoho/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17485331" filename="zoho">
<p> zoho </p>
<p> Teams have to communicate and for many situations, email isn't cutting it. Real time chat is how many of the most effective groups collaborate, but the right software can make a huge difference. This is where Zoho Cliq comes in with its user-friendly interface, laundry list of features, and numerous integrations. </p>
<p> Turning visits to your company's website into conversions isn't easy, no matter how good of a match you are for your potential customers. You need to keep people engaged, anticipate their interests and questions, and give them what they need before they move on to the next option. </p>
<p> Zoho's SalesIQ is an easy to use, yet very full-featured service that brings analytics, real-time user tracking, and live chat into one coherent dashboard that integrates with numerous other services you may already be using. Even better, you can make use of these features from the SalesIQ Android app, too. </p>
<p> Zoho isn't shy about its new app's target. Right there, at the bottom of Notebook's official product page, is a clear message saying, "Looking for an alternative to Evernote?" There's even a whole page dedicated to comparing side-by-side shots of Notebook and Evernote and telling everyone that although Notebook doesn't have everything now, it's on the right track. </p>
<p> So what exactly does Notebook have? Notebooks, ha! Obvious joke aside, you can create text notes, images, audio notes, and checklists. Then change their main color, group them into notebooks with assigned cover images, reorder them, move them to another notebook, search them, and share them over email or SMS. </p>
<p> Despite what many people think, Google Docs is not the only online-based office suite. In fact, some may say that a few of the others - like Zoho Office, for example - are even more full-featured than GDocs. </p>
<p> If you've been thinking about leaving El Goog behind and jumping over to Zoho's house, but the lack of an Android app has been the deciding factor that kept you from making the leap, we have good news: ZOHO Docs is finally available on Android. </p>
<p> ZDocs looks strikingly like to GDocs, which should aid in making the transition into the new home for all of your on-the-go office needs a quick and easy one. </p>
<p> We're all used to using our phones to spend money. Whether you're buying the latest game, a cool app or an additional purchase within an app, smartphones cost us lots of money. It's pretty refreshing, then, to see Zoho: an application which helps you make money from your phone by invoicing clients on the move. </p>
<p> Zoho is a cloud based service which offers its users lots of tools such as business email, customer tracking, and document collaboration. If you use Zoho, you'll be glad to know that it has just made the jump over from the iPhone to Android. It's free to use if you're only invoicing 5 people or less every month, but let's be honest, if you're only invoicing 5 people or less every month then you need to stop worrying about Zoho and start worrying about making money from your business. </p>
<p> Apparently Motorola is in the middle of a site redesign. Exciting, right? Pff... no. But the contents that were discovered because of said site redesign... now that's pretty exciting. PocketNow has acquired some images of the new site that display some upcoming Moto devices, including the XOOM 2, a couple of new handsets, and, curiously enough, a watch. </p>
<p> Let's start off with the new phones: the Slimline and the Zaha (shown above, respectively). First off, we have absolutely zero information on this pair, aside from the fact that they look super clean and thin. It's probably pretty likely that these are just codenames as well, so I wouldn't expect to walk in to your provider looking for them by these names in the foreseeable future. </p>

<p> zombie </p>
<p> N3V Games dropped Dead on Arrival 2 in the Play Store last week, but they made the game exclusively available in their native Australia and neighbor New Zealand. They announced that they would roll the game out globally on September 23rd, and while it may now be two days later, we can't blame them for giving their peeps a few extra days of exclusive playtime. Still, that time's up, so everyone else can now pick up their trusty firearm of choice. </p>
<p> The inevitable Zombie apocalypse has begun again, but for the time being, the outbreak is quarantined to Australia and New Zealand. Developers N3V Games are proud to work Down Under and are giving gamers in both countries a week of exclusive quality time with the title before launching the game elsewhere on September 23. In the meantime, Dead on Arrival 2 is available for all to see in the Play Store. </p>
<p> You're cruising the skies in a helicopter, when tragedy strikes. The chopper goes down and everyone dies. Literally, everyone. Except you. You awake in a new world. A world filled with the undead... and they're everywhere. There's nothing to do but run. For your life. </p>
<p> That's essentially the tone set for Into the Dead, a new first-person endless runner that just hit the Play Store. The game is quite popular on the iOS side of things, and for good reason – it looks amazing. </p>
<p> Yesterday, we got an eyeful of NVIDIA's new Tegra 4 and Tegra 4i, along with the Phoenix, NVIDIA's nifty reference device. The benchmarks were quite impressive compared to current-generation processors, but all we got to see in terms of gaming performance was a brief demo of Real Boxing. </p>
<p> In a video posted today to NVIDIA's YouTube channel, the chip maker shows off a "Tegra 4 enhanced Zombie Driver," side by side with the same game running on a "non-Tegra 4" device. </p>
<p> Before now, I thought that zombies had been added to every conceivable genre with the possible exception of farm implement simulator, and that's only a matter of time. But surprisingly, adding undead minions to a game that millions of office workers use to cling to sanity turns out to be fairly interesting. Despite the title, zombies don't replace mines in Zombie Minesweeper, they just add to the explosive fun. Check out the trailer below. </p>
<p> Minecraft - Pocket Edition may have one of the slowest development timelines around. Of course, the main reason we accept this almost Valve-ian wait is because every time we do get an update, it brings awesome stuff like friggin' Zombie Pigmen. Oh yeah, and the Nether Reactor that summons them, which is exclusive to the Pocket Edition. Heck yes. </p>
<p> The update also brings a few other new features, like paintings and mushroom farming. </p>
<p> There's no such thing as too many zombies, right? That seems to have been Glu Mobile's general idea when bringing Call of Duty: Black Ops – Zombies (or CODBOZ) to Android. The game, which itself is based on a spin-off of the original Call of Duty series, puts CoD players in familiar territory with a seemingly endless stream of zombies to eliminate in a game spanning not only multiple environments, but multiple gameplay modes as well. </p>
<p> The Men Who Wear Many Hats may have struck undead gold with their debut entry into Google's Play Store. Organ Trail is pretty much what it sounds like – a take on the classic nostalgia-fest that is the Oregon Trail, but with zombies, bandits, and an upgradeable station wagon. The game, which started on the web, hit Android recently, delivering the same epic experience players of the original would expect. </p>
<p> Once in a while, an Angry Birds or Temple Run comes along in the mobile gaming sphere. Games that are able to hook you with their simple but endlessly entertaining mechanics, and an ability to immediately "dive in" to the game at any time, even if for just 5 minutes (or 3 hours). </p>
<p> The problem with those games is that they're generally aimed at an audience that has never played video games, or has but doesn't actually love them. </p>
<p> Glu Mobile (makers of Bonsai Blast and a slew of other games) has treated Android users to another gem, combining powerful samurai, devilish zombies, and a stylized, adorable art style to make Samurai vs Zombies Defense. </p>
<p> Samurai vs Zombies is reminiscent of tower defense-style games, centering each level around defending a gate. Instead of simply setting up turrets and guns, however, SvZ allows players to go mobile, running toward packs of zombies and attacking them with typical sword swipes or special powerups. </p>

<p> zombie driver </p>
<p> A review of Exor Studio's Zombie Driver is somewhat redundant, since it's been available on PCs via Steam for almost three years. But as any dedicated mobile gamer knows, translating a console or PC gaming experience to a handheld is rarely as straightforward as developers or publishers think, and the $7 asking price is a respectable chunk of change, even for a proven game. So, does the NVIDIA-published THD version of Zombie Driver live up to its undead-slaying progenitor? </p>
<p> In the spirit of Halloween, let's give some stuff away! It's about treats after all - isn't it? And what better treat is there than free gadgets? </p>
<p> Since this is a Halloween giveaway, let's talk about the undead for a moment, shall we? In fact, let's get specific - let's talk about killing the undead with an assault vehicle made for mowing 'em down. Sound familiar? It should, because I'm talking about the newly released Tegra-exclusive title Zombie Driver. </p>

<p> zombies run! </p>
<p> Finding the motivation to put on your running shoes and get out to the street and, worse, start running can be tough. Zombies, Run! makes it fun by providing a back story and a "reason" for your run: Zombies are chasing you and your survival depends on running. It's thrilling and different enough that it could be the thing you need to start running and keep doing it every day. You might even get so passionate about it that you'd participate in the app's virtual races where you compete with real runners around the world. </p>
<p> Now the team behind Zombies, Run! is releasing a standalone app for these virtual races, but it's aimed at brands and charities. </p>
<p> Admit it, Glass owners, half the reason you're going to Google I/O is that you want to chat with other Glass people about how cool Glass is (hashtag throughglass). Google has given you plenty to chat about: they've just thrown a dozen new apps into the Glassware gallery, all of them from notable sources. Probably the most interesting is Livestream, the official app for Livestream.com, which was previously available as a side-load install. </p>
<p> Clockwise from left: Livestream, Duolingo, MusiXmatch, Star Chart, The Guardian, and Zombies Run! </p>
<p> Other possibly useful additions include a Glassified version of the Duolingo language learning app, a really cool take on the augmented reality Star Chart app, heads-up versions of the Runtastic and Zombies Run! </p>
<p> The premise behind Zombies, Run! is pretty simple - there are some zombies, and you're probably not going to want them to catch you. Fire up the app, stick some earbuds into your ear, and run. No, run! You typically don't spend too much time looking at your phone while using this app, but (wait, why did you stop moving, run!) the new update to version 3.0 will make sure the app looks holorific the next time you do. </p>
<p> Before. </p>
<p> After. </p>
<p> Developers Six to Start know users don't have all that much time to look at the app while they're running, so it's included a new wave of something other than zombies. </p>
<p> Six to Start's latest app is another pedometer for people who need more motivation to get off the couch. Similar to the team's previous game, Zombies, Run!, The Walk is an immersive experience that pits players in the midst of a suspenseful storyline - but rather than tap and swipe at the screen to make progress, you must get on your feet and move. It hopes to change your next walk around town into an adventure you will never forget. </p>
<p> The game begins with a bomb exploding in Inverness station and you being handed a package that could save the world. </p>
<p> Few things motivate me to run more than the threat of disembodied zombies pursuing me through city streets. For a while now, escaping the undead has felt dull and repetitive, as if I'm just going through the same motions over and over again. Fortunately, Six to Start is back with a brand new season of Zombies, Run! Fans of the fitness game have been eagerly awaiting a new chapter almost as fervently as Walking Dead watchers crave their favorite AMC hit. </p>
<p> For owners of the app, this update brings a refreshed look to the UI, revamps the base-building experience, and adds seven new missions to the storyline. </p>
<p> How far we've come since the early days of running from zombies! Why, back in my day, if we wanted to be chased by hordes of the undead, we had to actually get out of the house and run around, since GPS was the only supported method for keeping track of our progress. Now, however, the app that's designed to get you working out by forcing you to flee for your life has added accelerometer support, so treadmill runners can get in on the action. Nifty! </p>
<p> In addition to accelerometer mode, there is also a bit of new content. </p>
<p> Several weeks ago, Zombies, Run! gave our own Eric Ravenscraft a much-needed trip outside the house while he reviewed the unique workout/game hybrid. After using the application for several days, he came away impressed with it, though questioned its $8 price tag. If you share his sentiments, now may be the time to splurge and grab the download, as the price is down to just $3 until tomorrow. </p>
<p> For those who may not already know, Zombies, Run! is a unique application that turns your tired old running routine into a game of apocalyptic survival. Plug in your headphones, hit play, and start running - the app will be in charge of immersing you in a world filled with the undead. </p>

<p> ZTE Axon 20 5G </p>
<p> Although we've seen plenty of concepts and prototypes over the last year or so, ZTE is now technically "first" to reveal a phone with an under-display camera. That's right, the Axon 20 5G has no notch, no camera cutout, and almost no bezel. The front-facing camera can work right through the screen. </p>
<p> Chinese telecom gear manufacturer ZTE hasn’t had a particularly good run in the US smartphone market. But every once in a while, its eccentric phones manage to catch our eye, and frankly, they don't give us much to complain about. ZTE is now coming out with a handset that uses an under-display selfie camera — a first for any mass-produced phone on the market. The Axon 20 5G, succeeding last year’s Axon 10 Pro 5G, is set to debut as soon as early next month. </p>

<p> zte axon 7 </p>
<p> After a beta program with bizarrely strict requirements for entry earlier this year, an update to Android 8.0 Oreo is now available for the ZTE Axon 7 — with more than one catch. The update isn't being pushed over the air, but rather has to be installed from an SD card, and it'll wipe your device. </p>
<p> The ZTE Axon 7 has had fairly speedy updates - it received Android 7.0 in February, and 7.1.1 in March. The Axon 7 Mini, on the other hand, has been stuck on 6.0.1 Marshmallow this whole time. ZTE started previewing the Mini's Nougat update in March, and it's finally being rolled out to the masses. </p>
<p> The ZTE Axon 7 was updated to Android 7.1.1 last month, becoming one of the few non-Google devices to officially receive it. A new software update, referred to as 'B25' by ZTE, is now rolling out to the Axon 7 A2017U with a few minor new features and bug fixes. </p>
<p> I don't usually get super excited about deal posts, but this is a good one for one of my favorite phones. eBay has a sale going on the ZTE Axon 7 today for $330, which is a great price. The seller is even Newegg. Last time this deal was $350. </p>
<p> If you're after a device with a Snapdragon 820, 64GB storage, 4GB RAM, an unlockable bootloader, and ROM support for a decent price your selection pretty much boils down to this and the OP3T, and the latter runs a good $110 more. We noted in our review that this phone isn't without its drawbacks, though. </p>
<p> The ZTE Axon 7 was announced in May of last year with plenty of hyperboles over its BMW Designworks-inspired look, renowned pianist Lang Lang endorsement, and Dolby Atmos surround sound. In reality, the phone was very good, bar its software as Ryan discovered in his review. But ZTE has been issuing updates to improve some of the shortcomings, like the signal reception and the weird notification bell. Today, another update will start rolling to the Axon 7, though this one is a lot more major. </p>
<p> This is Android Nougat we're talking about, and with it come a host of changes like multi-window support, customizable quick settings tiles, plenty of new emojis, and more. </p>
<p> The ZTE Axon 7 Mini, as the name might imply, is a slightly-smaller version of ZTE's Axon 7 with downgraded specifications. The phone has a Snapdragon 617 CPU, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage with microSD expansion (if the second SIM tray isn't being used), and a 2,705mAh non-removable battery. Now you can grab it for just $199.99, $100 off the normal MSRP. </p>
<p> ZTE has been making some fine devices lately, and one of them is the Axon 7 which just went on sale a couple of weeks ago. The problem ZTE faces with enthusiasts though is the locked bootloader on its phones. This complicates things a lot for custom ROM enthusiasts as well as developers and modders who like to tinker with their devices. </p>
<p> But that situation is about to be resolved now. ZTE has announced that it will unlock the bootloader of the US versions of both the ZTE Axon 7 and Axon Pro, but only if you ask nicely. The requests will be processed on the Z-Community forums, within the Developers Lounge sub-space, and ZTE says it's reserved to "those with a high level of technical expertise and have had experience flashing custom ROMs." </p>
<p> The ZTE Axon 7 was announced to much "fanfare" at the end of May with famous pianist Lang Lang endorsement, BMW Designworks input, and Dolby Atmos surround sound. Sure, that's a lot of talk that means next to nothing to most of us, so I'll switch to a language we all understand: Snapdragon 820, 5.5" QHD display, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, USB-C, 20MP rear camera, and 3250mAh battery. Better? Alright. </p>
<p> The phone went up for pre-order last week for $400, an arguably nice price for what you're getting. But what if I told you that you could get it for more than $100 less at B&H? </p>
<p> ZTE knows it's not the brand most associated with quality smartphones, but the company is working to change that. Recent Axon devices have been very compelling devices for the price. The Axon 7 is ZTE's effort to take things to the next level. </p>

<p> The last time we covered LineageOS, the project had started supporting seven new phones, including the Xperia Z5 Compact and LG K10. Since then, several additional devices have been added to the official build roster. These include the Sony Xperia Z5, Samsung Galaxy S6, and Redmi 3S/3X. </p>

<doc url="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/zte-axon-m/" parent_folder="web1" id="file17483732" filename="zte-axon-m">
<p> zte axon m </p>
<p> It's official, ZTE's weird, borderline experimental dual-screen Axon M is now available at bargain basement prices. You can now find new 64GB AT&T-compatible Axon M handsets for $250 in the US on eBay, which is roughly 65 percent off the original $725 price tag. </p>
<p> "It's interesting." That's what I heard most often when I would show someone ZTE's bizarre dual-screen phone. </p>
<p> And, inevitably, "Who's it for?" </p>
<p> I never came up with a good answer. The Axon M is unlike any other smartphone on the market. Some people have made a point of likening it to the long-deceased Kyocera Echo, and while it is similar to that phone, the concept has evolved a fair bit. The Axon M is more mature, more considered, and more thoughtful - ZTE clearly spent time thinking about how a dual-screen phone would work, and how to minimize some of (though definitely not all) the pain points it would present. </p>
<p> Foldable phones aren't new. In fact, Kyocera sold one nearly seven years ago on Sprint. It was terrible, but my point is that the concept is not novel, and companies have even gone so far as to make such foldable smartphones commercially available. They've been rare, of course, and probably for a number of very good reasons: they're hard to design, hard to engineer without compromise, expensive to produce, and of questionable utility in general. </p>
<p> ZTE thinks it finally has a foldable phone you'd actually want to buy, though - the new Axon M. Will you actually want to buy it? </p>
<p> Today ZTE has announced the Axon M, a folding phone with dual 1080p displays. There have been a couple of leaks in the past month or two, but now it's official. The Axon M isn't quite the vision of the future we expected from Westworld, but it has some decent specifications to support its unusual design. </p>

<p> zte grand memo </p>
<p> Late yesterday, we headed over to the ZTE booth to check out the company's latest smartphone - the Grand Memo. The selling point? It's big and powerful - sporting a 5.7" display with a Snapdragon 800 600 processor of some kind. </p>
<p> Of course, that big display is only 720p. And that processor is paired with only 1GB of RAM. And it's using ZTE's Android acid trip of a UI overlay. </p>
<p> Say hello to the newest entrant into the bigger-than-a-phone-but-not-quite-a-tablet arena: ZTE's Grand Memo. It's a massive 5.7" device with a resolution of 1280x720, Qualcomm's quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB built-in storage, and a 13MP camera, running Android 4.1. While a 1080p display would've been a nice addition, there's no denying that the Grand Memo is quite a powerful device. </p>

<p> zte spro 2 </p>
<p> The ZTE Spro 2 was initially announced two years ago, and later available for sale through AT&T for $500 without a contract ($400 with an agreement). It's definitely an odd device - it's running Android with access to the Google Play Store, so you can project your favorite media apps without a connected device. Now you can get it for $399, $100 off the starting price. </p>
<p> Huh, exclusive? It's been nearly three months. That's long enough. We have a larger network than AT&T. We cover more of the country, which means there's a better chance we'll connect with someone who actually knows what a smart projector is and wants one. How many have you guys sold with AT&T anyway? </p>
<p> There has to be someone out there looking to sign a contract on a lightweight projector that's capable of running Android apps. </p>
<p> Wait, you don't even know what a smart projector is? Right... that might be a problem. Okay, I'm going to talk to my fellow AT&T execs and—you know what, screw it, we're going to sell this anyway. Someone out there is going to love it. I mean, what better way is there to impress your business clients than to whip out some cool, forward-looking piece of tech that no one else has even seen? </p>

<p> The OnePlus 5T is without a doubt an enthusiast phone. And what good would an enthusiast phone be without an available custom recovery? TWRP has just added support for the 5T, as well as the Moto G5 Plus and a few other devices. </p>
<p> Since our last LineageOS post, the project has continued to add new features and support new devices. In addition to new Quick Settings tiles and changes to included apps, the ROM now supports 16 additional devices. </p>
<p> Lenovo has a lot of things going on these days as it continues to make its Lenovo-branded devices while simultaneously digesting the corpse of Motorola. It also has other sub-brands like Zuk. The latest device in that family was just announced in China, and it definitely looks good on paper with flagship specs and a reasonable price. </p>
<p> Lenovo's ZUK smartphone brand got off to a great start in China when the recently announced Z1 managed over 2 million pre-orders in a week, but surprisingly, they aren't stopping in China. An international version of the Z1 is planned, and it's going to run Cyanogen OS (lens flair optional). </p>
<p> Lenovo already has cell phone legend Motorola under its umbrella, but the company has also started a new Chinese brand called ZUK. This firm is intended to compete with the budget offerings of Xiaomi, Huawei, and others. Its first phone looks like a good start too. The Z1 has a massive battery and a USB 3.0 Type-C port. </p>

<p> Doomdark's Revenge is filled with large-scale, fantasy-based warfare, but don't expect much in the way of spectacle here. This is the sequel to The Lords of Midnight, a game originally released for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPC (kudos if you can recall more than one of these products) in 1984. No, fans haven't had to wait thirty years for a sequel. Doomdark's Revenge first confronted players in 1985, but here it is again, updated for a new generation of mobile gamers. </p>
<p> Breathing new energy into Mike Singleton's 1984 classic the Lords of Midnight, Chris Wild has brought the game to Android. The game, for those unaware, is an epic adventure game – first enjoyed on the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 – that takes players (along with three other characters) on an adventure to destroy the Ice Crown and defeat Doomdark, with the option to recruit lords and troops to defeat Doomdark's minions. </p>

<p> This story was originally published 2020/03/05 7:41am PSTon Mar 5, 2020 and last updated 2020/09/23 7:11am PDTon Sep 23, 2020. </p>
<p> Zynga has officially announced that it's working on a Harry Potter match-3 game for mobile. This game is called Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells, and of course, Zynga has yet to share a single screenshot or video of the title. Paradoxically Zynga has noted that the game is already available as a soft-launch release in the Philippines, which means the studio is already publicly testing the title, which begs the question as to why there are zero screenshots or videos shared with today's announcement. Could it be that Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells is such a shallow cash grab that it's in the developer's best interest to hide what the game looks like before an official worldwide release? </p>
<p> CSR Racing 2 originally released on Android back in June of 2016. It's now over two years later, and the game is still running strong. But in order to keep fans happy over the years, new features have to roll out, and so Zynga has just announced a significant update to the game that adds sixteen new cars that span from the '60s to today. So if you have a hankering for collecting iconic vehicles, make sure to check out the new Legends update. </p>
<p> Words With Friends 2 - Word Game was recently launched on the Play Store as the follow-up sequel to Zynga's popular Scrabble clone Words With Friends. It is something of an odd release as it is more an expansion of the original gameplay than a true sequel. This luckily means that you can carry over your account and any game you are currently playing in the original to this new release without a hitch. It also means you can expect all of the same gameplay, but with a few new modes and words to play around with. </p>
<p> People Magazine and Zynga have teamed up to create the next "with friends" game. It is titled Crosswords With Friends and it is clearly a crossword game that focuses on People Magazine's bread and butter of entertainment, celebrity, and sports news. Each day a different puzzle with a new theme will be pushed to the app. That means you will receive 365 crossword puzzles a year. A lofty challenge indeed! </p>
<p> Welcome to the latest entry in our Bonus Round series, wherein we tell you all about the new Android games of the day that we couldn't get to during our regular news rounds. Consider this a quick update for the dedicated gamers who can't wait for our bi-weekly roundups, and don't want to wade through a whole day's worth of news just to get their pixelated fix. Today we've got a new JRPG from Kemco, a historically accurate turn-based strategy game, a new Zynga title that isn't terrible, a pixelated falling game, and a free take on Worms. Without further ado: </p>
<p> RPG Tears Revolude </p>
<p> Kemco is a prolific publisher of Japanese-style RPGs, and a big help for fans of the genre who are tired of paying Square $15 a pop for 20-year-old games. </p>
<p> The original CSR Racing racked up over 130 million downloads, becoming one of the top free-to-play games on mobile devices. It's no surprise that Zynga snapped up the developer, NaturalMotion last year for half a billion dollars. Now, the sequel has just been announced, and it's predictably titled CSR2. </p>
<p> Like its predecessor, this game will focus exclusively on the drag racing aspect with a ton of officially licensed cars from Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, and others. It's very, very pretty, but the gameplay is also quite simple. That's the formula that made the first one so popular, I suppose. </p>
<p> CSR2 will be soft launching in some regions over the next few weeks, probably on iOS first. </p>
<p> Zynga acquired NaturalMotionGames about a year ago for over half a billion dollars, and now the maker of titles like CSR Racing and Backbreaker Football has released the trailer for its first post-Zynga project. The game is called Dawn of Titans, and it's a big departure from the games NaturalMotion has been making thus far. In Dawn of Titans you control armies led by giant warriors as they do battle with other players. The developer promises fluid performance and quick gameplay that makes sense on a mobile device. </p>
<p> Stop everything. FarmVille 2: Country Escape has exited limited beta and is now available for wide release. It's time to grab your pitchforks, because there's virtual farming that needs to be done, and neither these crops nor animals will tend to themselves. You can check out our previous reporting on the game, but here's a trailer that should get you up to speed. </p>
<p> The graphics are greatly improved over the 2D original, as the game now touts 3D visuals that almost make the game tempting to play. Unfortunately, this is still FarmVille. That means despite the new cooperative gameplay, the ability to play on a mobile device, the option to play offline, or the free-to-play price tag, you're going to have to pay to play this game. </p>
<p> Here's the arrangement, dear Jaded Android Gamer - you will pretend you have zero interest in FarmVille, and we will pretend not to judge. Instead, we're even going to provide you with this tidbit of news: FarmVille 2 is coming to Android phones and tablets soon, with an early version already available for testing in select regions. </p>
<p> Horn came out on Android back in 2012, and it was a pretty big deal at the time. Phosphor Games Studio had previously seen success with Dark Meadow, and it was clear the studio could do great things. Unlike Dark Meadow, Horn was published by Zynga instead of the developer. The title made a splash when it was released, but the 1-star reviews piled up as updates failed to materialize. Phosphor Games now has control of Horn back in Google Play, but what went wrong? </p>
